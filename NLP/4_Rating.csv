0,13,7,4.0,"4.5 stars.Brand new gastropub with enticing cocktails, beer and wine, plus interesting options on their food menu. The bar is elegant, spotless and relaxed... Cool music is being played, and you immediately get a good vibe after you walk inside. I didn't have anything to eat (but planning on doing it next time), and Jaime was very helpful in selecting a beer for my mood from the 16 drafts they offer. The guy knows how to relate to his customers. I can't say enough about his demeanor, friendliness and willingness to make sure you have a good time. He's the type of bartender you want to tell your secrets and ask for advice. I hope I'll find him there again when I return in the future. Go and have a blast. And tell Jaime I sent you (the Italian dude who used to live in the city with the horse race... I doubt he'll remember...lol).",17,0.9764
1,13,7,4.0,"Cons: 1) Bathrooms. Not enough of them and always a crazy long line. Really ruins the museum experience when you're waiting to pee for an hour. 2) They've done away with the ""pay what you can"" model for most patrons (it's now only NY residents or students from the tri-state region). I always appreciated how the Met made art accessible to all - while I understand the reasoning behind the admission changes, it's still disheartening. 3) The gift shop is basically extortion with those pricesPros: Just about everything else. The Met has the most incredible collection of pieces ancient and contemporary that you can possibly imagine. It's no wonder that I've lived in NYC for over a year now and I've still only seen a fraction of the pieces on display. I love the traveling exhibits (especially those hosted by the Costume Institute), but other must-sees in my humble opinion include the mummy/Egyptian exhibit, the Medieval armor, and the contemporary art, which has a number of Picassos/Monets/Manets/Matisses/etc. The museum staff is also INCREDIBLE. I have never come across a member of the staff that wasn't amazingly well-versed in the layout of the museum. I find that they are all eager to help and love to give suggestions about what to see and how to maximize your time. Bathrooms aside, the museum itself is breathtaking. It's no wonder so many people come here to study, to draw, to get away from it all. Excited to come back in a few days for the Heavenly Bodies exhibit!",15,0.9784
2,34,30,4.0,"They were ""temporarily closed"" for over a year due to a catastrophic fire, and my poor heart was continually tormented by the evil foreboding that they might never open again, which is the fate common to so many restaurants that are temporarily closed for an extended period of time, and lose their regular patrons to competitors. If ever mortal felt jubilant at being proved wrong, that was my state when Sarge's reopened a couple of months ago, dispelling all my irrational fears, and I was proud to be humbled [**oxymoron alert**] by the triumph of my beloved deli over the calamitous fire that had interrupted its operations. The pastrami is generous in portion and its texture is every bit as buttery as I remembered it. The chopped liver is smooth and tasty. The complimentary cole slaw is light and balanced, not too vinegary, not too sweet, just right. The corned beef hash is a prodigious portion and comes with three eggs. I am never able to finish it even though I tend to overeat every time I am at Sarge's. Oh, and the crinkle-cut fries are just right, with a crispy exterior and soft inside. The decor (or lack thereof) is unassuming and reminiscent of old school diners that are so hard to find these days. The service is friendly, familial even, if you dine here frequently and they start to recognize you. I used to live on the same block as Sarge's, and this used to be my haunt for a late night indulgence. Having long moved away from the neighborhood, I still make the urban trek to eat here every now and again. The fact that they're open 24 hours does not hurt. Eating here at the wee hours of the night also provides some interesting people-watching opportunities. Be aware that this is a kosher-style, not kosher, deli. I continue to be the heinous heretic who prefers Sarge's over 2nd Avenue Deli and Katz's.",43,-0.5954
3,11,8,4.0,"Came here for dinner with my bf. Walking in here was an experience on its own. The decor and ambiance was absolutely beautiful. Very sexy and grown with areas for date night and a nice group family or friend dinner. We were seated in the back in a quiet couple area and I loved it. Super romantic! I had the chai drink and it was absolutely amazing! We tried a few others including the lassi (all alcoholic) and they were too strong and harsh for our liking.For appetizers we had the lamb keema, and chicken 65. Both were amazing! The keema came with some bread that was the perfect accompaniment! Delicious! For entree we had the onion and cheese naan and the butter chicken with a side of rice. Nothing special here, I've had better butter chicken before but definitely enjoyable. I liked the naan but my bf didn't. I guess it's a matter of choice. The service was exceptional! Probably one of my fave things here after the ambiance! The portions were a little small and it was pricey but overall it was a nice date night spot. I would definitely recommend going at least once. I want to try to brunch next!",20,0.994
4,13,4,4.0,"This place has been on my radar for a quite a long time... I finally made it there for a quick snack! I was so happy to see all the beautiful, colorful, vibrant and adorable desserts lined up neatly, waiting to be chosen. At this visit, I just wanted something adorable, no matter what kind of dessert it was, or what kind of flavor it was. We got was Raspberry Lychee Tart and Lucky Hazelnut. The Raspberry Lychee Tart shell was rather hard, it fell apart as I tried to cut them in half... And it didn't have much lychee flavor, unless you eat the actual lychee on the bottom, I wish if it had more lychee flavor. Lucky Hazelnut was sooooo fluffy and bouncy, with excellent hazelnut and vanilla flavor. We also got Matcha Cream Puff. It had loads and loads of filling, it was simply awesome! The cream filling had a great matcha flavor, sweet without being overly sweet. Excellent cream puff!To wash off all the adorable, sweet goodness, we bought Praline Latte and Brown Sugar Tea Latte. Praline Latte was tasty with nice praline flavor. For some reason, it was not as hot (temperature wise) as it should have... Brown Sugar Tea Latte was much sweeter than I expected. It was tasty and I could really taste the brown sugar, but at the end, it was a bit too sweet for my taste. They had so many more pastries and baked goods that I still want to try, so we will be going back for more sometime in a near future...",20,0.9881
5,14,9,4.0,"A utopia for Nutella fanatics like me.When I heard a designated cafe for my favorite spread was coming soon, flashbacks from my childhood rushed into my head: my mom using it as a spread atop king hawaiian rolls for breakfast, my cousin and I sneaking downstairs past midnight to dip strawberries into the jar, and even seeing Kobe's face on the wrapper nearly 20 years ago lol. So with it occupying such a special place in my heart, you can probably imagine my excitement for the grand opening.However, I was initially rubbed the wrong way upon seeing the horrendous line wrapping around the corner -- not the fact that it was there, but how it was handled. Certainly, a long wait is to be expected at such a hyped spot and the capacity constraints must be abided by. But instead of letting a few people inside as a group was finishing up, the protocol was such that a table had to be emptied and cleaned before the next party could be admitted, which led to several minutes of these seats being unoccupied, when visitors could've spent the time perusing the menu. My friends will say I was just impatient and hungry, but I def think this process could be streamlined!But all is forgiven with a creme brulee, grilled baguette, and sourdough toast with ricotta and fruit -- all with sweet sweet nutella, of course. We also shared an espresso drink, which was a good palate cleanser between the more desserty dishes. The concoctions are endless: nutella popsicles, nutella gelato, nutella fondue, etc. I'll 100 be back for more, and hopefully the traffic flow will have been improved.",14,0.9909
6,9,5,4.0,"This is the ""other"" vegan dim sum restaurant in Chinatown except 100% vegan so I'm told. The one on Mott has some items with egg. The menu is super similar to the one on Mott. They have a large variety of dumplings with various fillings, rice rolls (cheong fun), steamed buns, and other typical dim sum items like turnip cake, siu mai etc. the stand out item for me is the baked vegan char siu bun-- omg the bun is so soft I didn't believe it was vegan and thought it had egg. They also have vegan Xiao long bao (soup dumplings) which I've never seen before (don't have this at Mott). However sadly I don't think it's that good. Doesn't really have soup inside and I don't like the filling. I prefer their other dumplings. The rice rolls are good! Steamed well and they are soft and chewy. Love the char siu filling or faux shrimp filling. Besides dim sum there's also entrees like noodles / chow fun/ rice dishes. Chow fun is good. They also have vegan sushi which looks kinda weird haha. Anyhoo, overall it's great to have a full vegan dim sum place around. In summary- try their char siu anything (by itself, baked buns, pastry, rice rolls). Great for a dim sum craving. Good prices. Best to come with a group of 3-4 so you can try more things & split everything! On average should be paying like $12-15 per person? Or less depending if you get entrees. They do take credit card. Service is average. Nothing outstanding, nothing too offensive. They're not gonna baby you like waiters at fancy restaurants trying to get more tip. They just take your order, serve your order then get you out lol. Would I come back? Yup! For the char siu bun. Do I have a preference over this or the one on Mott? I do like the one on Mott better. I feel like their dim sum tastes fresher and a bit more tasty.",18,0.9958
7,31,23,4.0,"I trekked to the barren tundra of way uptown in Harlem at 143rd street to meet up with a friend who was on the prowl for some quick late night D action, as I was acting as her wingman for the night.She didn't score any D, but a drunken gal at the bar showed her some quality D pics on her phone to tie her over for the time being. The night started off uneventful but turned into an epic evening of amusement watching the booze infused locals try and hook up. Solace is a fun little locals bar with nifty happy hour deals, a nice menu of food items made fresh per order, good bartenders, and some solid cocktails. Happy hour is twice as nice! Sunday-Thurs, 4-7pm and again 10pm-12 midnight. 4-7pm on Fridays and Saturdays.The mac & cheese was a tasty treat, the hell fire shrimp was ok, the fries were standard. The Hennygria cocktail served in a beer pint glass was tasty and sneaks up on ya!Solace also offers a weekend boozy brunch option with unlimited dranks! Maybe next time my friend can try some day drinking and score some afternoon delight D!",33,0.9937

Got my tickets through the lucky seat lottery for $45 each - $40+$5 processing fee x2 (luckyseat.com/lottery.php for anyone else interested). Picked the tickets up an hour before the show and to our surprise, we got seated right by the boxed area next the stage on the second floor! Super close to the performers, which is pretty cool.

9,19,4,4.0,"This is Tao Group's newest rooftop lounge! Located in the Flower district. I think I read somewhere it's now the tallest rooftop bar in nyc which is pretty rad. Why it's cool: floor to ceiling windows, you're basically level with the H&M tower, they have awesome DJs at night coupled with a really sexy dark vibe-- and during the day it's classy and dainty. Yummy cocktails and probably the best Cosmo I've ever had in the city thus far. Also there's a crazy sick disco ball in the center of the bar. Super cute for Instagram photos!",20,0.979
10,10,6,4.0,"I actually prefer The Pool better than The Grill because it's more brightly lit and I like seafood more than meats. However, you can't go wrong with either.First of all, the restaurant is wonderful from start to finish. Everyone is very friendly and they take hospitality seriously. The dining room is large, spacious, and sophisticated. People dress up here! I enjoyed my red snapper -- crab and shrimp on top were a nice touch. I really appreciated the attentive but not overbearing service. Michelin-level service without the Michelin star.",14,0.9428
11,19,5,4.0,"A nice novelty that everyone should do at least once. I live in NY and sometimes will do the touristy things during off season times to avoid the crowds. I've been up here before, but this was before Yelp so I obviously couldn't write up the review and a lot has changed since the 90's. I wasn't sure of the potential crowds during the day I went, so I played it safe and purchased the VIP tickets to avoid waiting in line for too long. It helped a bit, but the lines weren't overly long either. During busy times and the summer, I would imagine they would come in really handy. There's a little video in the elevator on the way up, which is a nice little touch. Inside the lobby, there is a lot to take pictures of, so have the cellphone ready. They take precautions here, so when going through security, bags, jacket, cell phones, and even belts are put into trays and you step through a metal detector. It's pretty much like an airport, but the added precaution is always nice. They do try to take pictures of you with a green screen to purchase later. They don't force you, but you can always reject the picture later on the way out if you don't want it. It's pricey for two pictures (either with the same background or one different) and a digital copy, but for a keepsake, it's not bad. On the deck, you have a lot of different angles to view from though it's not as spacious on the outside as you'd think for an iconic building observation deck. We didn't have any problems finding room and it wasn't really that crowded when we end. People tend to move around from areas a lot, so if you're patient, you can always find a spot to look or take pictures. Even on a nice day, it can be a little windy up there, so be warned. On a clear day, you can see pretty far. As mentioned, you need to come up here once in your life whether you're local or not. There is no time limit that I know of, but during a busy time it can be crowded and confining. Most of the staff was generally pleasant. There is a large gift shop on the way out. Obviously they have a lot of King Kong merchandise, though I kinda wish they had the Independence Day spaceship on top of the building though. Some of the items are pretty nice actually, but not cheap of course. Worth browsing for sure. There is a lot more to do and packages available, though most just come to get to the top. All in all, this is a historic building and should be visited at least once.",21,0.9969
12,23,12,4.0,"I have to agree with other Yelpers who say this place is a little overpriced, but I will also admit that for some reason, I like it a lot.  It's also a five minute walk from my apartment, so that might have something to do with it. But it's also a very relaxing place, with great drinks and very good food.Alp and I have been here for dinner a couple of times because it's so convenient and walking to 6th Avenue for dinner seems a little more refined than walking to some place on 9th Avenue.  Service tends to be a bit all over the place but usually ends up being pretty good when they see we are going to eat, drink and then eat and drink some more!Over the course of our meals, we have had chicken dumplings, fried cheese curds with olives (curds are amazing) and buffalo meatballs (seriously mouthwateringly good) and short rib mac and cheese (a bit much for me) for starters. For sides, I've had the fries and the saffron mashed potatoes. Loved the fries but the saffron overpowered the taters so I was not a fan.  For entrees, I have had the NY Strip as well as the ribeye steak. Both were good, but the ribeye was much better. Apparently they have seafood too, but I like my meat with feet!For desserts, the apple tart was good but the chocolate hazelnut cake was super delicious. This feels to me like a nice local spot to have a laid back dinner, although I've never gotten out of there for less than $300 on dinner for two. But, what the heck, I'm worth it and so is my baby.",26,0.9974
13,24,11,4.0,"Kefi is a wonderful Greek restaurant on the upper west side. Don't let the small entry fool you, Kefi is plenty big to accommodate groups of all sizes and even hosts an event room downstairs that is very nicely decorated.The wine selection is good and the food is pretty delicious. The food portions are pretty ample so do go with an appetite as it will be put to use. Of course, the lamb dishes are my favorite with meat that is delectable with just the right char and seasoned flavor. I mean this place even makes a delicious salad! It sounds crazy but everything is fresh, crisp and well rounded. The service is spot on, with a mix of friendly and professional. I think this would be a nice place for a friendly date. If you are looking for something romantic, speak up when making a reservation so that you can get seats near the entrance by their beautiful bar.Also, the bathrooms are downstairs but they are very nice.

14,21,10,4.0,"Glad I rediscovered this place I forgot how good it is. First time back we had no rsvp no biggie wait time by the bar area is great since they have the late happy hour, we got the Lychee martini sooo good!! Great tasting & good amount of alcohol, usually my go too here. Kalbi short rib is amazing great tasting sauce grill just a few minutes each side & it's perfect.. definitely a favorite. Great tasting Filet Mignon. Meats tend to be excellent here. We also tried the Shrimp very good with the garlic sauce. The Sauté chicken was good as well, do prefer the meats. On the sides The Chicken garlic noodles are great, nice tasting noodles great flavor. Can't stay away from the Garlic rice lorddd so tasty. Sauté Spinach in garlic is delicious such a great taste. Appetizers can be tricky since it can be too much food, the Calamari is really good lightly battered great dipping sauce. Wings are good as well. Rsvp help but are not necessary, service is quick & prices are very reasonable great tasting food & drinks at reasonable prices will for sure keep coming back.",22,0.9942
15,27,15,4.0,"After opening its door in 2005 as a small stall in Flushing, Xi'an has come a long way. With more than 10 locations in the city (and still growing), everyone has one particular store they prefer or frequent. Among them, this location is my go-to because of its ample seating and spacious layout.Everyone talks about the Spicy Cumin Lamb Hand-ripped Noodles and for good reason. Perfect balance of cumin and spice, the aromatic sauce clings on to the thick noodles that are perfectly cooked. The dish is flavorful and quite uniquely delicious. However, my absolute favorite item on the menu is the Spicy & Sour Lamb Dumplings. The dumplings comes out submerged in red sauce, which may resemble fiery pits of hell for people who are spice-intolerant like I am. However, don't let its appearance fool you. The dish is more sour than spicy, and it complements and heightens the lamb filling. After discovering these serendipitously, I've gone back to Xi'an Famous Foods just to have these dumplings (and forgo the noodles completely). One important note: These Dumplings are not available at every location at the time of writing, much to my woe. The location on 54th Street happens to serve them, so if you happen to be dining at this particular restaurant, I would strongly suggest that you give it a try.",24,0.8166
16,12,6,4.0,"Really impressed with the vegan Sichuan dishes here. I was worried I would see dishes too similar to other vegan Chinese restaurants. But the standout here is the Sichuan style offerings. I appreciate the expansion of vegan friendly options but I like variety and creativity in addition to quality. I came for dinner and was taken aback slightly by the crazy colorful disco lights flashing. The place was packed with diners chatting and eating away. The service by the way was superb- super attentive from refilling our drinks, bringing extra sauces, to replacing utensils which my friend kept dropping on the floor (waitress was quite observant to have kept noticing and was so patient to walk right over with a new set)For food, we tried several dishes primarily from the small bites section.Favorites were the steamed vegetable dumplings and the vegetable wontons in chili oil. While I can get these veggie items at other establishments (these are not new to the scene), I did appreciate the flavor and quality - they were fresh and delicious. I also really enjoyed the Mala beyond beef meatballs and the honey walnut edamame nuggets because I'd never tried vegan versions of some of my favorite Chinese dishes. The Dan Dan noodles were also good with the beyond beef crumbled atop. The peppercorn brussel sprouts were good but were the least exciting compared to the other dishes. From the big bites section, we tried the Dry pepper style eggplant and Dry pot style tofu. The eggplant is deep-fried and has spice which I preferred over the tofu dish. Note you have options (eggplant, tofu, or mixed veggies) to pair with the various big bite dishes. Not sure if dessert is offered. We had other plans after downing the delicious savory goodies. Small spot packing heat in small and large vegan bites. I would like to take my mom here!",20,0.9956
17,16,4,4.0,"Last night at Mira Sushi was actually my 1st event as a elite member of the Yelp club. First, thank you Ruggy for allowing me to attend. I arrived a bit early and actually paced back and forth outside for about 15 minutes before I actually went inside. Honestly, I was a bit nervous lol.. After going inside, I was greeted by Ruggy who gave me a comfortable place to sit and a name badge which I thought was cool. Started off with a glass of sake and some Parmesan truffle fries that were flavorful with a good crunch not saturated or weighed by the oil. Good stuff . Shortly after, a sushi pizza appetizer was brought out .... it was pretty spicy! Just like I like it lol. Then we got to the the tasting menu which was fantastic. Small bites of innovative sushi style appetizers along with the sake, and oh yeah I switched to rose' somewhere throughout the courses lol, we're a delight. The one course that I had questions about was the authenticity of the Wagyu slider. Didn't have the fat content of traditional Wagyu beef. Tasted very lean despite being cooked at what looked like medium temperature‍. Overall the look of the place was great with its dim lighting and elevated table chairs. The waitresses were consistent with making sure our glasses were always filled cant forget to mention how cute the were . Got the chance to meet some great people who sat with me and talked about where we were from and what they did for a living. Great mix of people with diverse backgrounds brought together by our passion for great food. I had a great time!!!!! It's was definitely worth it.",17,0.9976
18,60,30,4.0,"All in all, I had a wonderful time here. ""Is 11a too early for a glass of wine?"" the receptionist asked. With a newborn that just got into sleep training and Mama averaging 6+ hours of sleep at night, I'll take a glass anytime I can get it.They were really understanding of my train delay too (Ihateweekendtrainswhodoesnt) and I still was able to get my full booking despite being 20 mins late. I enjoyed my glass of white wine in a jacuzzi before the spa got really packed. I received my facial-- never having got one done before cause I have really sensitive skin and hello, horror stories of permanent scars-- but now I'm hooked. They look at your skin under this ginormous bright magnifying glass x1000 and yes, I know I have blackheads. Did I know they extend to my cheek? No, not to my (nor anyone else's) naked eye. BTW, don't book any dates til a few days after cause your skin will look red, bumpy and blotchy. BUT a week later, and I have to say my skin is looking brighter and more... supple, yes... Next up, massagy time! Very good. I asked my masseuse why I have this annoying pain in the middle of my spine and she said that I had a mild case of pregnancy-induced scoliosis. Ahhhhh that made a lot of sense! Also, made sense why my epidural failed (which ended up saving my baby's life)-- a story for another time. Thank God for my scoliosis then. She also said I could work on some back exercises which may help it go away (working on it)Gift from The Husband was again, a huge win. Much improved from the early dating years of ""What do you want for Christmas this year?"" Overall, great customer service! From the receptionist to Nina-- the skin aesthetician to Sofia-- the masseuse. Reminds me, Nina is from Uzbekistan so I said, ""Oh, according to ancestry.com, I'm actually 1% from Kazakhstan"". She says ""You look like you're from Kazakhstan. They are very strong"" (my mind is blown but also flashes to Borat voice 'In Kazakh, the women are very strong. They pull the plow like ox'.

I came to this location to vote during election time. They were gracious and the premises were always clean. Since I moved from the vicinity I heard of some disturbing incidents. That was a couple years ago. I'm not concerned because even prestigious academy's have had incidents not far from here. PS 169 tightened control and security since then.

20,10,3,4.0,"So, it was my Birthday Dinner! We decided to spend it at Osteria Morini. I had heard so many great things about this restaurant. When walking into this dimly lit, rustic restaurant It is just so cozy and romantic. We were a little early so we found a little area to hang out by the bar and try one of their cocktails. We decided on the soho special. It had vodka, espresso, vanilla, cream and club soda. The first sip we took reminded us of a spiked Yoo-hoo. It was so delicious. Def a must try when you come here. Our reservation was for 7pm and they seat and the exact time. We were seated in the back close to the open kitchen. It was really cool to see them cook. Also, we were able to see the gentleman cut the meats for the antipasto. The staff here is so pleasant and accommodating. Our waitress answered all our questions and recommended a lovely wine. We started off with a meat and cheese platter. We ordered way to much but it amazingly delicious. Speck, prosciutto and bresaola and Squacquerone (a spreadable creamy cheese), Parmesan reggiano and a Lardo spread. With a basket of warm bread. This was Ahmazzzing start!!For our second course we had pasta.Tagliatelle bolognese this was rich and full flavor dish. Ton of meat and the pasta was perfectly al dente. Def a must try.Our next pasta was super unique and something you won't find anywhere else. Spallina which is a double ravioli. It has two envelopes. One side with duck the other side with apple and parsnip. It's enrobed in a beautiful robiolina and butter sauce. The ravioli was cooked perfectly and the flavors worked perfectly together.To finished our dinner portion we tried the prochetta with beautiful crunchy, creamy potatoes. This was a beautiful dish. The porchetta although a tad fatty was juicy and full of beautiful flavor and the potatoes was nothing I every came across. We ordered the mushrooms as a side and although good a little over seasoned.At this point we were stuffed but we did order dessert. We ordered americanos and the crostata. Although good it was very sweet. I only was able to have a few bites.Osteria Morini is just an amazing restaurant. The food is of the highest quality and so is the staff.

Since it was an early Sunday, there was plenty of space at the bar for all eight of us and my daughter's stroller; I was able to park her right up to the bar.The bartender was very nice; she offered to make me another drink after I ordered something that tasted more like a spiked green juice than a cocktail but I decided to finish it and order something else. I tried their jello shots which were ok but I've definitely made better at home. We all shared their wings which were really goodThe decor is sexy and bathrooms are huge. That was a big plus, considering I had to roll my daughter's stroller in there to change her. I definitely want to visit again to try out their menu, either for brunch or dinner.",24,0.981

Yelp searched and found Ajo E Orégano..a Yelper favorite, located a little over a mile away from the closed restaurant I thought would be open to fulfill my oxtail needs. Arrived a few moments later. Found parking as someone was pulling out. Confidently walked into what shocked me as the teeniest restaurant I've seen in sometime. Excused and squeezed myself towards the back of the colorful, Caribbean-esque, galvanized tin ceiling, shack-like, island replica of a restaurant. There were people lined up and seated in every single inch of this place. All these things were a good enough indication for me. All the employees were working efficiently to get the to go orders and seated patrons orders placed. After a few moments of waiting, I was next in line and the gentleman who served me, was pleasant and helpful as, Yo hablo muy poco Español. The fine gentleman filled my to go container with enough Moros, Chivo Liniero (Goat Stew) and Maduros to feed four. The gravy had a nice flavor, but the stew could've been a bit more tender.I would go back but either on a Friday or Sunday to try out their Rabo Encendio (Oxtail Stew) as those are the only days they are served.

24,18,5,4.0,"Just stopped by this place this morning and really loved all of the options that were there! The format was a bit hard to navigate -- as far as there is no directory and you may feel like you're stuck in an eating labyrinth --- but that has never stopped my excitement. I can't wait to go back and try the Frites bar where you can order to your heart's desire what kind of frites you'd like. Only had time to stop and try an iced chai latte from the coffee spot inside Le District and it was absolutely delicious and very affordable. It also came out very quickly, which doesn't happen in nearby coffee spots at Brookfield Place (looking at you Joe & the Juice). Will be back again to try more!",19,0.7832

It was also extremely cold outside and they couldn't keep the restaurant warm.We had:- Scallop (regular and bay) - delicious​- Tuna Belly - terrific- Salmon - very good- Sea Urchin - delicious, highlight of the meal- Blue Crab - very good- Spicy Tuna Roll - good and an interesting choice - at the original location, they don't serve spicy tuna rolls- Green Salad - good, it was a plain saladOverall a very good sushi experience.",19,0.9936

The ground beef arepa with cheese and sweet plantain, and finally the smoked brisket with sweet plantain. All are nice portions and definitely fill you up. Go with 1 or 2 to share.

27,18,10,4.0,"In looking for the door to this place, I nearly walked into both the chopped salad place next door and the travel/luggage store on the other side but the end result was worth the minimal embarrassment. I'm not a big coffee drinker but I love a good Italian pastry or sandwich as much as the next person. I knew I had to come back once I saw the tub of Perugina chocolates sitting by the counter. If you've never had the pleasure of unwrapping one of these babies and savoring each bite, you honestly haven't lived. These make Hershey's taste like chalk. I usually go with a cappuccino + croissant, though, if you're in the area for lunch, do yourself a solid and grab the caprese panini. They'll toast it for you. Back to the pastries: Zibetto does an amazing chocolate cornetti (don't call it a croissant). I also love the tiny butter cookies that they serve with the coffee drinks. Planning on trying the cannoli and tiramisu next. Also, Starbucks has ruined all the traditional coffee drink names - like another reviewer pointed out, it's not a ""latte"" but a ""caffe latte."" I watched the barista gently point this out to someone: the two had a good laugh over whether or not the guy really did want a cup of steamed milk.",23,0.9906
28,30,12,4.0,"One of my favorite omakase establishments in the city. The chef seems adamant not to serve the American holy trinity of salmon, yellowtail, and low grade tuna which is truly appreciated. Most, if not all, of the selection of fish and other ingredients comes from Japan. When each course or nigiri is served, the chef presents a ""flash"" card with the name of the fish. This may seem a bit odd but I actually like the practice so that It may be reference later when I desire to partake in additional items. Note to self: control yourself! I'm a little fatty so, YES to adding more portions. It helps me to recall the delicious meal I just had. The fish along with the chef accoutrements are texturally sensational and flavors divine. I enjoy the pickled ginger offered for cleansing between each serving. The staff are attentive throughout the meal and may assist with selection of the proper beverage for your meal. The overall experience is personal and generally a low key atmosphere. A wonderful culinary experience...indeed!",34,0.9908

The prices are high but matched by attentive though not overly aggressive/hovering service. The couple next to us was celebrating a birthday and they brought the woman a little gift bag and dessert (clearly they'd ordered quite expansively). Brian Newman's band plays on Saturday nights (9-12) and it's worth getting a table for drinks, appetizers, and dessert if you don't feel like ordering entrees or a full dinner. Chocolate cake was decadent, as were the truffle fries. If you're there to see Brian and choose not to get a table at the bar, I'd get there early. The stage is elegant, though small.

32,13,8,4.0,"A friend and I came in on a Friday night with a 6 pm reservation, but it didn't seem too packed yet. To start, we had the agedashi tofu, which I thought was good, but nothing too special. My friend loved it though. For my entree, I went with the assorted sushi and sashimi ($38). This came with 9 pieces of sashimi, 6 pieces of sushi, 3 pieces of a sushi roll, and 2 of those egg things (which I could have done without). It would have been nice if they explained each fish to us but they kind of just left the dishes on our table, and walked away before we even had a chance to ask for anything else. Everything was good though. I really liked the tuna (which is usually my fave), the uni, and the salmon - plus the fact that it was very lightly seared.It's a little pricier than other sushi restaurants of similar quality, but worth it for a once in a while splurge. Maybe next time I'll try their early bird special for $30, which includes sashimi, sushi, soba, and dessert (also avail on Fridays!)",15,0.9811

The pan-fried noodles with chicken was delicious as well.Overall, it was a satisfying meal.

34,17,5,4.0,"Came here on Sunday for a late lunch on a very rainy day. The staff was talking amongst themselves when we arrived, but were quick to help and jump into action. We ordered the Falafel Trio platter and the Deluxe sandwich with avocado. I probably would've added fries to my sandwich if I could, but the only option was to have them as a side, so we passed. The woman taking our order, noticed I was feeling under the weather and let me know that they also sell tea in case I wanted some =), that was nice of her.There are a few high tables and counters for seating, but I can imagine the place filling up during the lunch rushes, on non-cold and rainy days. The table we sat at was a bit dirty, but nothing a little wet nap didn't clean right up. The table was designed with photos of chickpeas, which was cute, and there is a water cooler at the front counter for you to take as you please. There is also a clean bathroom available for customers.We received our food pretty fast, and it was great. We were a little afraid that since the place was empty coming in, that the falafel wouldn't be crunchy or etc but that wasn't the case at all. The falafels were super crunchy, the hummus was great, and just all the food in general exceeded our expectations. The trio platter is definitely enough for two people, just get an extra pita bread, or two. Because we ordered two items, we ended up taking home half of the trio platter and it made for a great dinner the following night. The falafels were really good even when reheated in the toaster oven, and didn't get dry.All in all, we'll be back here for sure. I'm already craving it again.",19,0.9904

Pocono Pasta was nicely al dente and picked up all the cheesy goodness. Cheese & Charcuterie platter came with Humboldt Fog, manchego and a blue, alongside prosciutto and other meats.WDB also offers a variety of wood-fired pizzas, which seem to be a popular choice at the tables. If you're adventurous (or in need of a different protein source), try their Roasted Cricket Pizza. Tuna crudo, Broccoli & guacamole, Woodpecker fried chicken sandwich, Woodfire salmon were all enjoyed by friends. It seems their kitchen most certainly utilizes their wood-burning ovens in preparation of many dishes! Desserts were sweet endings, including a Creamsicle creme brûlée and Strawberry red velvet ice cream sundae. Banana chocolate pb cream cake with warm chocolate sauce drizzled on top was quite decadent. Overall a nice spot deserving of future visits, ideally for brunch next time!",24,0.995
36,13,9,4.0,"It was a dark and stormy afternoon. As the winds whipped up the rain outside, my friends and I sought refuge from nature's battering against our umbrellas and coats. Like a mirage in a desert, 169 Bar's colorful sign called out to us and we quickly made our way into the establishment, huffing and puffing as we streamed in through the small entrance.As we entered, the familiar dive bar combination of bleach and spilled drinks of the past hit our noses. Dark corners abounded, others were lit by the various colorful lights set up throughout the bar. Kitsch abounded. To the right, a painting of a woman with strategically placed googly eyes. Right next to the entrance were two wood mermaid carvings that looked like they once roamed the high seas in the front of a boat. Towards the bar was a functional (and shockingly clean looking) water fountain, complete with a pile of cups. The bar was very clean and organized and not exactly what you would picture when someone says ""100 year old dive bar"". I appreciated the decor and sense of whimsy.Our party had arrived at an odd time, so there were not a lot of people. We only wanted to grab one drink and rest a bit and so we ordered. The bartender was a friendly, easy going gent who seemed very at ease behind the bar. I wound up ordering CC's Bourbon Mint Lemonade featuring Bulleit Bourbon, Lemonade and Mint. This was served in a nice tall glass with bits of fresh mint in it. The drink is nice and sweet but the Bourbon definitely gives it a bit of a kick. It was also refreshing, and I could not help but think it would make a great summer drink.We headed back out into the thrashing rain soon after, but our respite had been a welcome one. Apparently the food in 169 is well thought of and I made a mental note to try it some time as I said a quiet goodbye to the wooden carvings near the door and exited.",12,0.9826

38,14,7,4.0,"A friend told us about this place since it's near where we live so on a lazy Saturday afternoon we decided to check it out.ATMOSPHERE: Inside is very cozy and has a half cafe feel half coffee shop. When you first walk in you are hit with a blend of smells including spices and coffee. There are some high tables, small tables and then high stools facing the window. It was pretty crowded when we came so we were barely able to find a seat.FOOD: They have coffee as well as food. The menu on Yelp is a bit outdated as they seem to have other options as well. We opted for 2 things and shared them. They both come with a tahini sauce I believe and an orange slice.PITA LABNEH - basically it's like a flat pita bread toasted with cheese and spices inside. It kind of me reminded me of a bagel with cream cheese but really thin. I honestly don't know why they charge so much if there's no meat, I think it was almost $10. It was pretty tasty.GREEN OMELETTE SANDWICH - a large omelette with veggies stuffed inside of a pita with lettuce and tomato. It was pretty hefty and is definitely enough for 1 person to feel full. I don't normally like omelettes but this wasn't bad since it was in a sandwich form.Overall, good food and I would definitely like to try some of their other items and hummus as well.",17,0.9875
39,14,5,4.0,"When I started seeing these cutely packaged bubble tea drinks on Instagram, I had to check out where this place was! Upon stepping in, I was expecting to see the pink and blue couches. But the store is actually pretty huge. You order by the counter first and walk further down for the cute seating area. At the time we went, they were doing $2 drink promotions, where each day offers a different discounted drink! This is an amazing deal as my Mai Tai Tea only ended up being $2.18! So take advantage! Aside from the cute aesthetic interior, they also had a clean, sleek bathroom, and played fantastic music. There is even a heater in the seating area, perfect for the cold winter day. Unfortunately, the drinks were not on par with everything else. The lid for the Haitai Tea was different. I had to lift the flap open to put my straw in, which is really weird. But the other photos didn't have that lid, so maybe it was just that day. And while people raved about the bubbles, I personally found the bubbles undercooked tasting. They were hard, and not the good kind of chewy. The Mai Tai Milk Tea with Milk Tea was too sweet. Fortunately, they look out for lactose intolerants here and had soymilk & almond milk options! The Mai Tai didn't taste as sweet with the soymilk but was overall, nothing special. I would not pay full price for this ($5) as the size was pretty small too.Overall, I had a fantastic first experience here but their drinks are otherwise pricey for the quality.",20,0.9765

As an appetizer, I split the dumplings filled with potatoes and herbs (#13). There are 8 dumplings, so even though it's listed as an entree, sharing this is a great appetizer. I don't remember what my friend got, but it was a vegetable entree in a kind of soup or very liquid sauce. There was a side of rice so all mixed together it was a great combo. I got the pan fried noodles with shrimp (#31) and it was amazing. I would definitely eat here again. I either recommend coming alone or with maximum 3 other people.

Grabbed a couple seats, greeted quickly, and ordered drinks immediately.Decor is awesome and I love how the goth/nautical theme makes you feel like you're in the downstairs of an old, dark, cool pirate ship. We ordered the Halibut Ceviche, super fresh and tasty. Also got the Octopus Skewers, usually like my Octo a big on the charred/crispy side, so it was a bit chewy for me, but still well done.

42,25,8,4.0,"I visited Tomino after the restaurant had been added to the list of NYC's 2019 Michelin Bib Gourmands, and I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant. Little Italy needs a little more diversity in the style and cuisine of restaurants in the area, and Tomino is a much needed addition. The first half of the venue is set up in a true tapas restaurant style - with plenty of counter seating for guests to get a glass of wine and enjoy a variety of small plates. The second half of the restaurant is a traditional dining room, and good for parties both large and small.My guest and I started off with a number of tapas. The classic Pulpo, or Octopus, was cooked to a perfect texture and sprinkled with a generous amount of paprika. I did find the flavor to be a little monotonous, however. Loved the Huevos Rotos, and the Lamb Chops were so flavorful and paired deliciously with a chestnut puree; however, I will note that while we asked for medium rare, it was cooked to a very noticeable rare. I would skip the Scallops - three of them are served in a scallop shell and covered in a generous sauce. The scallops were slightly undercooked and had no sear or texture.The star of the dinner was definitely the Tomahawk Steak for Two. It was beautifully cooked and presented, and at the ideal medium rare we asked for. Each cut was so flavorful, and I appreciated the range of lean to fattier portions of meat available. I wasn't a huge fan of the semi-soggy potatoes, but my guest enjoyed them more.Service was on point and very attentive, and our water was refilled constantly. While I overall enjoyed the experience, there are some tweaks and misses on dishes that make the place fall just shy of perfect.",23,0.9854

47,26,14,4.0,"I first saw The Polynesian float around my Yelp feed a few months ago. I was instantly hooked; being someone who is a fan of tiki and Polynesian aesthetics, I smashed that bookmark button hard. I was in midtown for a meeting the other day and one of my colleagues suggested we go here afterwards, so naturally I eagerly said yes. I haven't seen too many tiki bars around NYC; most of my experiences with them have been in Florida at Disney's Polynesian Village Resort. That's really my reference point, which can be a good and bad thing since Disney tends to exaggerate many of their themes. Either way, I went into the Poly with an open mind. The bar is located inside the Pod Hotel on 42nd street. We were instructed to check-in on the ground floor where we received wrist bands and then went up to the lobby level where the bar was. I really didn't get the whole wrist-band and check in thing since the space was mostly empty when we arrived, but whatever maybe it's part of their operating procedures. Anyway, the space was quite large; they had a combination of lounge seating, tables, booths, and outdoor/rooftop space. The decor was *perfect* - it captured the tiki bar feel but also had a sophisticated edge to it that prevented the space from being kitschy. They really paid attention to details like low lighting and branding on the plates and coasters - I really appreciate little things like that. We were not hungry so we decided to all share some of the large-format drinks. We tried the Barbossa's Punch first which was rum-based and had a number of fruit juices plus other goodies in it. The drink was tasty, strong but also smooth. It was served in a ceramic treasure chest which was a nice touch. The second one we tried was the Humuhumunukunukuapua'a which was served in a large fishbowl. This was also rum-based with some absinthe, coconut, and juices. Like Barbossa, it was smooth and fun to drink.Contrary to some reviews here, I thought service was fine; they checked in at just the right moments and got our drinks out relatively quickly. The bathrooms are also worth noting - the stalls are private with full-sized doors for optimal privacy #bless. Overall, I enjoyed the Poly - the drinks were good and the aesthetics were on point.

48,22,10,4.0,"Katz's is probably the most famous deli in New York, if not the world.I've lived five minutes from here for almost three years but my first visit was last weekend. Somehow my desire for meat and willigness to wait in line never quite dovetail. But around 11 am on a Sunday the lines were mild and my boyfriend and I decided it was the day.Katz's is chaotic in a way it doesn't need to be. Confusingly, there's a small section for table service. There are at least three places to queue for food, though I believe only two of those serve sandwiches. The lines are self-forming and unpoliced, which leads to a lot of cutting.It took us maybe 20 minutes to get our sandwich, and that was with a negligible line compared to the hordes coming in when we left. Service is rushed and indifferent. Tables aren't very clean and if you get soup there'll be about as much on the plate as in the bowl.So, why go?The pastrami is truly all that. Thick cut, mildly smoky, moist, reminiscent of a pleasantly fatty brisket. Excellent. All it needs is that nice sharp mustard and a few bites of pickle. Absolutely worth the $22 split between two people.We also had a chocolate egg cream (unknown, at least $5) and matzoh ball soup ($8). The former is a great example, a bit creamier than typical. The latter is mostly broth and ball, but both are solid. It's massive so split this as well.After tax and tip, this somehow added up to $60. They're cash only and you pay with your ticket on the way out.Overall, the experience is stressful but it's worth doing at least once.

That's a heck of a lot of wood paneling! All that was needed was an old TV with rabbit ear antennas with Scooby Do and The Jetsons being shown.Its actually kind of neo-retro cool, and a different look over the cookie cutter Irish bro-fest bars that occupy Yorkville. Taking up residency in the spot that the tired and boring Jack Russell's was in, Jack and Fanny's is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and offers up something dissimilar from the norm up here. Someone needs to tell some of the Yelpers here giving two star reviews to lighten up and get over themselves a bit. Have some fun and open your minds up just a little. There are still plenty of boring sports bars on the UES to watch football at while drinking crappy beer and eating fattening fried food with all the bro's. You'll be just fine.I have not tried any of the food here yet, but the house cocktail list is fun and there is a decent selection of craft beer to choose from. I found the bartenders to be polite and helpful. It's a big space with more than enough seats to chill at. Some funny signs and pictures on the walls too.Brought here by the same owners of Bondurants across the way, yet it's a totally different type of style and worth giving a shot or two. Total nostalgia, and brings back fond memories of visiting long gone relatives while chilling out in their ""finished rec room"" downstairs.Now, hand me a Bocce Ball and stand back!",36,0.9831

Cake batter & Maple Bacon ... we're our choices Cake batter vodka martini wow what a great flavor & taste to this really surprised at how much u can actually taste the alcohol really didn't think that the ice cream would have such a strong alcohol taste. The Maple Bacon Bourbon was good as well nice combo the sweet & salty would b nicer if the bacon was more crispy. Second time around we had the ice cream flight great way to try few flavors. Vanilla bean bourbon good flavor, Hot buttered Rum was delicious, Red Velvet martini was not bad & the cake batter martini great flavor too. Small location not a lot of room for sitting down, cute decor ... they offer an ice cream happy hour very cool.

58,21,11,4.0,"I came here with two of my friends for dinner. My friend reserved a table and we were seated once everyone arrived. The waitress was very informative, patient, and helpful in explaining the menu. What I love about this restaurant is the palette. The menu changes daily so there are so many dishes you will never try unless you come here all the time. There are so many different flavors which beautifully come together. The whole experience was an 8.5-9.0/10. My friend really wanted to try the rotisserie duck, but you need to reserve that so maybe next time... My favorite dish was definitely the sizzling Grilled FlatironWe started out by ordering from the Raw section of the menu: the Maine Uni over rice. It was filled with a variety of flavors. I am not used to the fine-dining experience so when I first saw the dish, I just thought ""that's it?"" That's when I realize uni is a delicacy. Then, we ordered from the Large section of the menu: the Grilled Flatiron. The waiter poured shaoxing cream sauce which caused the dish to sizzle. The beef was cooked and cut beautifully and the sauce made it all the more appetizing with the enoki mushrooms. The meat was very tender. 10/10 (I loved it!) Then came another dish from the Large section: Shellfish & Sambal. I thought the Sambal made the noodles very flavorful and spicy. The coconut flavor was very evident in the dish. The shrimps were huge and nicely cooked, though I was not a huge fan of the shrimp. I thought this dish was not incredible since there are definitely places that serve curry just as good, but way more affordable. Finally, we all decided to order a slice of coconut pie for each person. This pie was a wonderful surprise. When the pie slices came, we slowly stared at what was on our plate. When I think of coconut pie, I pictured a giant custard pie with white coconut cream on top. What we saw was a dark slice of coconut pie with coconut whipped cream on the side. I placed my spoon and took a piece of the coconut pie and smattered it with a small smear of coconut whipped cream. The slice of coconut pie was so well put together. Sweet and savory. I applaud! This is probably the best coconut pie I've ever tried (so far) in my life.",26,0.9967

It's the restricted diet answer to Panera Bread or Cosi. Well, surprised to say that it is actually good. I thoroughly enjoyed my vegan mac and cheese (large portion) and it definitely filled me up. The rest of the menu looked very appealing and I was tempted to get something else. This mac and cheese was good for vegan food (obviously nothing beats the real deal), and I enjoyed sampling their chipotle aioli sauce.It's expensive to eat out in this neighborhood, and as far as prices this is on par with what you would end up paying at Dig Inn or any other ""fresh ingredients"" sort of place.",16,0.9544
60,16,7,4.0,"This Japanese transplant is popping up like daisies in NYC, for good reason. It is delicious. They design their seating, and operation to be good and fast and arguably a place to steak for one. You pay when you leave. You order the steak at the grill station and the server takes your order for sides and soups. High tops are meant for side by side seating or seating for one. Might not be comfortable for some, and don't recommend for groups. Takeout is available... definitely want to try that one day and see how that is. It is inexpensive for steak at a restaurant but to be clear, it is not ""cheap."" Meats are still a range of $3 per oz and up. My hubs got the ribeye cause that's his fave. I don't like ribeye, too fatty. You have to order a 10oz min. I ordered my fave which is the filet, min 7 oz. They have other cuts, like assorted cubs, sirloin and even wagyu which I think is pricey but guess that is pricey everywhere. When the steak comes out, it comes out on a VERY hot plate so you want to order it rare. That's what they recommend and they might glare at you if you don't actually. It cools down quick. Be sure to pour some steak sauce on top of it before it does. They put a dollop of garlic butter atop. The steak is really really good and 7oz for me, of filet is plenty. Also, you can add on a garnish for $1. This is where I think they make a ton of $$$. They give you little for $1 and I think this should be included anyway. But, they do include basic onion and corn I think. I got potato, green bean which I could have done without. My hubs got broccoli as a garnish. You can get a beefy miso soup (comes as a mug), and side house salad for $5. Some might say it's small but I think it's fine for me. I got two mochi for $4, pretty good mochi where more ice cream was tasted, less flour and gelatinous chewy parts. The green tea and strawberry was good. Service was pretty good- typical Japanese politeness and attentiveness with water refills. I'd come back but I'd skip the side salad, soup, and maybe go with just one garnish. Good for them for trying something different. Total bill was some $66.",18,0.995

I would say both are worth the price. Lunch has more limited selections but still has the prime good stuff for what you are paying like pork belly, brisket, short ribs, tofu stew. I would say meat is not the all time best quality but it sure came plentiful. I was partial to the none marinated meats. Ate it all and then some. The meal comes with bon chan like kimchi, a light cabbage slaw, onions and bean sprouts. For dinner, it came with cheese corn as well. Wait staff was very attentive and they truly earned their tips by helping you bbq and cut the meats. I would say this place is great for small and big groups.

(Slim is the guitarist for Lady Antebellum and he calls his music ""fake jazz"" but I can definitely say it was amazing!)Anyway, so I came here and had a wonderful evening. Drinks were small but strong, so that was nice. Everything was a little pricey but I liked my food (except for the ""jumbo lump crab cake"" which was neither jumbo nor lump-see picture) and I had a very relaxing and memorable evening.The show I saw was in the lower level and it was very nice.

Let me explain.Tiny Shanghai is tucked in Little Italy, looks a little too new to compete with the cult classics of Chinatown, and draws in a hipster crowd. It took a few minutes to understand, but upon tasting the food, everything made perfect sense.The soup dumplings were simply amazing. The skin was very deliciously thin, but held just enough strength that it did not break or let any precious soup out. Sometimes the tops can be wrapped too thick to enclose the dumpling, but these were flawless and delicate. The scallion pancake with beef was 100% THE BEST I've ever had. The pancake was the perfect amount of crispy, and loaded with cucumber and a sweet sauce on the beef. I cannot recommend this dish enough!Chinatown is filled with a certain type of Chinese restaurant- they've usually been around for decades and you can tell the chefs are immigrants that passed on recipes and have been cooking food their entire lives. You can taste the hard work and dedication, and sense the chef has been seasoned with generations of cooking experience. Tiny Shanghai reminds me of a hip, busy restaurant in Los Angeles with bombbbb ass food. Everything about them says young and west coast. They are the next generation of authentic Chinese food, taking those same old recipes, making it their own, and doing it well. Major kudos to you, Tiny Shanghai!",84,0.9956

Yes, you'll probably spend anywhere from $14 to $22 for two tacos, but they're substantial tacos, not to mention delicious. The wine list caters to high rollers, but it has plenty of options for the hoi polloi.Most importantly, the meal was a brilliant combination of fun and fine dining. The servers are pros all the way and not the least bit snooty, and many of the dishes -- from the chips with guacamole and seven salsas, to the seasonal fruit dessert assortment -- are just flat-out good times.

Let's be right on the money though- I think I have a say on this one and have been coming to Jagua on and off- for almost 20 years. During that time, things have changed, portions changed, as well as taste. But on plus side- they ditched the vinyl table covers for faux-wood table tops and ""woven"" neutral place mats. Don't get me wrong- Dominican food here isn't horrible at all. But it's enough for me to notice obvious differences- or maybe I'm just wishing for Dominican food- the way my Mom makes. With the ever-changing Lower East Side, high rises, chichi Lounges, yada yada yada- it's downright nice to see Castillo is STILL pumping out Dominican food after all these years. Hubby would come here on a daily when he lived in the LES in the late 80s- so I guess these guys are doing something right. Seems small, but Castillo has plenty table seating plus more at the counter. Go in and sit yourself with Merengue, Bachata, Perico Ripiao or Salsa always playing- so you're all good with the music. A few slips along the way, but really nothing to make me not want to return. Will brutally say though- it didn't dawn on me til midway our Lunch- that on my most recent visit with Mom and my hubby- Maduros I ordered, tasted like they've been fried using the same oil for other stuff (Chicken?

Forget about all the other ""Jagua"" restaurants- this right here folks is king. Crowd? A real nice mix of cultures digging in plus prices are real damn good. Service?

69,16,4,4.0,"KenScale: 8.25/10I have been very excited about a Renaissance of sort with all the exciting Chinese restaurants that have opened in New York City that create their own paths with distinct menus and culinary styles. In particular, the restaurants showcasing Chinese-style rice noodles called mifen, starting from Little Tong Noodle Shop, are quickly challenging the stronghold that Japanese ramen shops currently enjoy in the city. Hunan Slurp is one of the new trailblazing newcomers in this regard, with an interesting background story of the chef who was once an artist who ""seek to cure his homesickness through cooking"" (directly quoted from the restaurant's website) at this new sleek operation with futuristic décor. While Little Tong's noodle dishes are based on the influence of Yunnan province in the southwest of China, this restaurant, as the name suggests, draws influence from the Hunan province in central China. The biggest mistake my wife Jun and I made once we sat down and browsed the menu was that we did not realize that the restaurant does not yet a liquor license and therefore can't serve any alcohol. We both like to wash down our food with some sips of wine, cocktails or beer so that was a huge oversight, even more so once we realized how good the food at Hunan Slurp was.Contrary to my initial thought that this was a noodle-centric shop, Hunan Slurp's menu is surprisingly expansive, starting with hot and cold appetizers followed by mifen and seasonal specials sections. We weren't quite sure about the portions of the dishes and ordered only three which turned out to be a wise decision because the portion was quite generous. As if reflecting the chef's background, the plating of each dish had a certain artistic appeal to it, starting with the skewed beef with cumin in toothpicks that was a beauty to look at under the lights and was a great way to start the meal with chewy beef piece that was a perfect bite size. We also tried the Farmer's Egg dish consisting of stir fried egg accompanied by pepper and pork. I very much liked its robust flavor with spicy kick although Jun thought the seasoning was a little too aggressive and ordered a bowl of white rice to help neutralize the seasoning. For the mifen, we decided to go the other direction of spiciness spectrum and ordered a bowl with fish fillet and seasonal green. The broth was pure white and already smelled wonderful when the bowl came in front of us; its aromatic flavor helped balance out the bold flavor from the other two dishes and turned out to be more and more addictive as I slurped the noodle. Jun remarked that the soup reminded her of a Korean delicacy called jiri (a type of mild fish stew) known for being a perfect hangover cure and generally a very popular food for good health. Combine with fresh fish fillet (there are some small bones here and there so watch out while you eat the fillet), and this bowl turned out to be quite a stand-out noodle dish that would've been even more wonderful on a rainy evening.The restaurant does take reservations, but if you don't want all the hassles, you can probably walk in on the earlier side of evening (which is what we did on a recent Friday). As noted above, I lament that the restaurant does not have liquor license yet and hope they do soon and find out some interesting alcoholic beverages to match their dynamic food offerings. The dining space and vibe of the restaurant would work for a number of different occasions such as casual dates, get-together with parties of around 5 or 6 (I actually think large groups may work pretty nicely because the menu is large enough to allow for sharing of several dishes), etc. If you want to see an evolution of contemporary Chinese cuisine in a modern setting that also gets the cooking right (unlike all the Taos of the world), I highly recommend that you check out Hunan Slurp.",23,0.9959

The portions were decent and they chose a great selection of their delicious dishes. Well worth it when you are a struggling student who wants to eat fancy for a day.

You can choose between the thigh meat or white meat for the roasted chicken but they have flavorful fried chicken strips as well with a spice dusting and a mustard dipping sauce. I usually come here for the roasted thigh over kale salad with a hard boiled egg. The avocado in it is a nice touch as it is also roasted. The chicken and rice platter is also great as it has tomato and fried shallots. The rice to me though was a bit undercooked. They have great granola here as well and wonderful bite size dessert pastries like apple, peanut butter and chocolate, and seasonal pumpkin.

They are a chain from Taiwan and this is their first US location.ATMOSPHERE: The inside is very small with only 1 small bench and a few counter spaces where you can stand. It's definitely not somewhere you can hang out in. Otherwise, the inside is more of a rectangle that is very narrow and long, it's open and has a lot of greenery. I also liked that the TV displayed how they make their tea and other items so you can see what the tea looks like and where it comes from.FOOD: They have a few signature drinks and one interesting thing is that if you get a cold drink you have to get the ""large"" size, which is starting around $5. The cups are paper and not see through so you can't see your drink.GOLDEN OOLONG - I wanted to try this since I had never heard of it, when I asked him what it meant he said it's just oolong but a bit sweeter and very good. I added honey to mine (extra 50cents) and got the brown sugar boba (extra as well). My total came out to be over $6, but I guess you are getting a larger size than you normally would. The oolong was good, I could really taste the tea flavor and it had more of a roasted taste. The honey was pretty subtle, I got 70% sweetness but for someone who likes their drinks sweet, I think next time I would get 100%. The boba really does taste like brown sugar and I feel like that flavor overpowered the tea sometimes. Overall, pretty good chewy boba that was slightly warm.My friend got the strawberry milk tea and it had actual bits of strawberry and at 50% sweetness I thought it was pretty good. My friend doesn't like sweet drinks but she still liked it so I think if you don't like sweet drinks, you should get 50% or less.Overall, although it's pricey the quality of the tea is good and they have some interesting flavors.

The space once occupied by another business had been completely renovated and made into a gorgeous restaurant/bakery so I could not resist checking it out!The inside of Fournos Theophilos is like a modern day steam table style restaurant where a long (and I mean long) counter starts in the front and goes all the way to the back. At the very front is a small seating/waiting area. The back has what appeared to be a food prep area, but I did not go all the way back there. With Earthy tones and wood in play, the decor is warm and welcoming.It was the evening rush hour when I visited and the place was largely empty. In this part of town your big crowds usually hit at lunch time and in the morning so that was not a surprise. What was great however was seeing how even after a long day the staff was super friendly and happy to explain what was what behind the counter. Since I was already meeting friends for dinner, my focus was on dessert. Here is what I picked up to go (and would try later at home over the course of several days):Baklava: One of the best I've ever had. The dough was crunchy and light while the nutty layer was the perfect thickness for a for to crunch through. Sometimes this layer is hard as a rock, other times there is not enough. This was just right. The flavors were on point and the syrup was not overly sweet.Mini Baklava with Chocolate: These bite (or two bite) sized Banklavas had something I had never seen, a small dollop of chocolate on top! It occurred to me I have never seen this combination so I snapped it up to try. Man am I glad I did! It was a bit more dense than the regular sized Baklava but it had the same flavor punch and the chocolate added a wonderful element.Portokalopita: This Green Orange Pie winds up having a fluffy, cake-like texture that was really nice. The orange zest does not overwhelm the flavor at all, but it is present enough that you taste something very different from most cake-y treats!I have to emphasize again that the staff here was very nice and patient with me as I tried to make up my mind on what to get.

The ones that are served up at The Nugget Spot, though, are far from your typical chicken nugget.Now that I've visited several times, I'm happy to report that the nuggets are consistently made, and feature real chicken; take a bite and you'll see the actual protein inside. Not only that, but the owner is frequently there to oversee the kitchen, and takes real pride in the product. My personal favorite items are the Cheese n Chong, which dusts each nugget in an even powdered cheese coating, and the Tso Swag, which is a riff on General Tso's Chicken. The variety of dipping sauces is no joke either, and I would highly recommend the OG Ranch and their Truffle Mayo.They do rotating monthly specials, which is an even bigger reason to come visit on a regular basis.

You would be correct Manchi has taking over the square footage previously occupied by The Bombay Sandwich Co. with some of the same players involved in this new creation. Manchi (means good) is their new concept that aims to take Indian Cuisine and give it a lighter feel in a fast casual manner without sacrificing any of the flavor that it's known for. It is often said that Indian food is tasty but way to heavy and leaves you feeling stuffed after consumption. With Manchi's twist you get the Indian flavor profiles with healthier options that eliminate the heaviness. That way you can grab a bowl bursting with flavor for lunch and still be able to go back to work without needing a nap. At an event last week I had the opportunity to taste test an option from their still developing menu along with some of their house-made sauces and lemonades. Since their menu has yet to be finalized I can't say if what I had will make the final cut or not but it was sure a hit to me. Bowl:Super Salad: cracked chicken w/ cauliflower, potato, string beans and rainbow slaw, served over kaleSauces:Mild- Coconut ChutneyMedium- Manchi sauce Spicy- Crazy sauceDrinks:Homemade Mint LemonadeHomemade Hibiscus Ginger Lemonade Home-brewed Masala Chai Tea Desserts:Hot Chocolate CookiesHomemade Tahini Bliss Balls: dates, tahini, pistachios, agave, cocoa powder & sesame seeds.My decision to go with the Super Salad bowl was a great choice and I went with the Manchi sauce and the crazy sauce both were excellent to compliment. I would like the crazy sauce to pack more heat and the Coconut chutney was ok but not particularly for me. As for the drinks the Mint Lemonade won me over especially when spiked, didn't care for the Hibiscus Ginger Lemonade nor did I try the Chai tea. Lastly you can do no wrong with either desserts both were worth the treat. Overall a great spot with some very pleasant owners and staff so a big thank you is definitely in order for their hospitality. Just A Note: When you need to refuel after tackling the one day sale around the corner at Macy's stop by Manchi... I know I will because it ""means good"" and it is!",20,0.9957
82,14,5,4.0,"This place is definitely good. I only ordered two things, the samosas and paneer tikka masala. They were both good and flavorful. I'm very sensitive to spicy food, and usually these two things aren't very spicy to me but here they were. I didn't mind, but I needed more rice than usual, and kept chugging water. The price isn't bad, but there are also places that are just as good and a little cheaper. Delivery time was about average. I'm currently just trying different Indian restaurants that deliver from seamless and new ones keep being added. This won't be crossed off my list by any means, but before I order from here again I'd like to try all the other places I can order from around here.",16,0.9395
83,13,6,4.0,"I would love to say I loved it. I really did enjoy being there - new restaurant, talented kitchen, interesting sounding dishes on the menu, beautiful space (60th floor was always spectacular even in my JPMC days). Just look outside the window!Had dinner reservations here and knew for sure which starters I wanted to try.For the first course, shared the following from the prix-fixe menu:CAVETELLI & CLAMSTomato, Breadcrumbs & Sausage-Pasta is usually a safe choice and this dish is a sure bet to please most diners as long as you're not vegetarian LOBSTER QUENELLESpring Onions & Trumpet Mushrooms-this was very interesting. Lobster is mushed and combined with starch to create this round chewy piece. It's accompanied by chunks of mushrooms and more lobster and a very tasty gravyFOIE GRAS MOUSSEStrawberries & Brioche-I was not a fan of this combination. I did not appreciate the strawberry gelatin and the brioche was too flaky and not substantial for my liking. I forgot to mention the complimentary bread basket but the baguettes come out nice and warm and the butter salted and perfect. I could have eaten bread all night. In my opinion , the baguette paired better with the fois gras than the flimsy brioche From the snacks/bar menu, also tried the following as first course:CROQUE MADAMEBéchamel, Ham & Quail Egg-easy to finish in 3-4 bites. Perfectly crunchy , salty, cheesy, and eggy, and delicious RAW MARKET VEGETABLESTarragon & Sesame Crumble-simple, light and refreshing For the second course, tried a few items:TURBOTRoasted Fennel & Sauce Mustarde-this fish was much more flavorful and meatier (yet tender) than I had expected. Light, fluffy texture and satisfying WAGYU BAVETTESquash, Pommes Anna & Creamed Spinach-while you might think steak is heavy, the flap is small and juicy; and the accompaniments actually create a balanced dish. ZUCCHINI & SQUASH ROULADEOkra, Eggplant & Vegetable JusAlso from the bar menu, tried the:FRENCH ONION BURGERGruyère, Caramelized Onion Jus-All-beef 70% protein and 30% fat resulted in a very juicy burger that is difficult to finish if you plan on eating anything else. A few bites is satisfying and it actually began to hurt my tummy to try to eat more- it's on the greasy side For desserts, I tried:STRAWBERRIESOlive Oil Sablé, Basil & SabayonCHOCOLATE MOUSSEToasted MeringueBURRATATomatoes, Herbs & SorbetThe desserts were too rich and complex for me. If i could turn back time, I would re-think my selections. Of the 3 I tried, I did like the chocolate mousse. Not my favorite of all time, but I enjoyed it most compared to the other 2 desserts. I thought the strawberries would be refreshing but the cream and jelly textures continued to weigh me down. I like sweet and salty but the burrata was not doing it for me. The blend and temperatures did not appeal to me. Not a fan of the desserts here. Due to the richness of the entrees, I prefer the smaller dishes / lighter bites. I know there are overlaps, but in general I feel the bar menu appeals to me more specifically the snacks. Curious to see if and how the menu evolves are more reviews come in",23,0.9972
84,17,5,4.0,"We came on a Sunday for lunch and were seated immediately. Pork sisig is so good. I haven't had pork sisig in the states, but I loved it here. This is a very popular dish in the Philippines and it was perfectly balanced here. It comes on a sizzling hot plate and has a good balance between meat and cartilage. Well flavored, crispy, and not salty.Garlic rice is good. It's flavored with fried garlic and not salty either. This pairs well with the pork sisig. Palabok was good as well. Dry noodle dish topped with boiled egg, boiled pork, tinapa flakes, and a few other toppings. Good mix of flavors with lots of noodles. Service was excellent. Constant water refills and the food quickly came out.",19,0.9948
85,16,5,4.0,"Came here with a group of coworkers on a balmy Friday afternoon. The Polynesian is located at the top of the Pod rooftop - minimal signage, but just go right into the hotel elevator and head up. We got to the bar shortly after it opened. There were no seats left outside, but we got a standing table and later moved to seats when one opened up.The space is beautiful and the roof is spacious. Think we got lucky with seats because it's relatively new, but I can see this spot blowing up as the summer progresses.Fun tiki theme, however the cocktails are way more complex than your average pina colada which may throw off the casual drinker. Reviews of the drinks amongst my group were mixed, but I was generally a fan of everything I tried (note: I am very easy to please). There is one shared drink that comes in a fishbowl that I would not order again as it was too sweet and medicinal.Side note of vessels that our drinks came in: a flaming skull, a boat, a fishbowl (with fish), an Erlenmeyer flask wrapped in some kind of leaf, a treasure chest....you get the idea.Didn't order food except for a side of spicy fries, which were good to soak up some of the alcohol (despite appearing so, these drinks are no joke), but seemed slightly overpriced at $7 for basically a handful of crinkle fries.5 stars for the vibes, 3-4 for everything else.",20,0.9818
86,24,8,4.0,"Sel Rrose is a French-ish cocktail and oyster bar popular with fashion folks, offering up spritzes and small plates in a faux-industrial space off the Bowery.This place is best used as a post-work happy hour, and is accordingly mobbed 6-8 pm with hour-long waits and no texting system, though it isn't too tough to grab a reservation a day or so on OpenTable ahead of time. I came with my boyfriend on a Friday around 7 after we finally bit the bullet and planned ahead.The space is gently photogenic, with weathered walls and dim lighting, and despite the frou frou branding and prosecco-topped drinks, the tech bros standing near the bar didn't look too uncomfortable. There were also a good mix of couples and groups of girls. Buzzing atmosphere and on the loud side.Cocktails are $15 across the board, with gin, rye, and tequila well-represented, and egg whites, grapefruit, and mesquite honey guest starring. Lest you think this means girly, low-ABV drinks, the drinks tend to be spirit forward and very good.French 27's thyme-infused rum came through more than its sparkling wine topper, but I wasn't complaining. Even better was the White Rose, a well-balanced and sweet rye-based sour with nice notes of ginger and pineapple.Oysters are $3 - 5 each, with a paper menu to check off your order. We had a half dozen, largely West Coast, and were happy but not over-the-moon. Well-shucked and presented on a tiered platter; I would bet their plateaux are impressive.They also have a varied list of plates, ranging from risotto croquettes to watermelon salad to duck leg confit, from around $10 to $20. We opted for brussels sprouts ($9), a balsamic-drenched, slightly crispy version with apples. Steak tartare ($17) was a similarly satisfying rendition.Service wasn't ideal; super hard to get them over and we often would start an exchange and have them walk away before we could tell them the second thing we needed. I was sitting under air conditioners and was continuously dripped on (as were the couple of booth seats next to me).Sel Rrose is not as amazing as you want it to be for the price, but it does a lot of things well and it works for many occasions. It's not pushing any boundaries here, but it doesn't need to-- it's the equivalent of upscale comfort food, a nostalgic reminder of European vacations past on the Lower East Side.",23,0.9494
87,18,7,4.0,"I met a colleague here for lunch before heading to a nearby meeting. We both wanted to sit but didn't want anything too adventurous. When my colleague sent me L'Adresse's Yelp page it seemed like the perfect fit so we booked a table.L'Adresse is located right across the street from Bryant Park. That and its close proximity to Times Square predispose it to heavy foot traffic. That kind of seeps its way inside; the dining room is huge and open, filled with people eating lunch. The aesthetic is very contemporary with clean lines and dark wood colors throughout. The restaurant was loud but also really spacious and modern. L'Adresse describes itself as an American bistro, and that's really apparent on the menu. The dishes looked interesting and upscale, but also tangible to almost everyone. My eyes immediately went to the salads - more specifically the wild arugula salad. It was served with grilled shrimp (aah!), butternut squash, and shaves of parmesan. The salad was good - it was dressed well and had a tangy/pungent flavor. The shrimp could have had a bit more flavor, but it's forgiven since the salad itself had strong components in it. It was a win overall.Service was great, food came out fast which I kind of expected since most of the diners (including us) had to go back to work. Overall, there's nothing that will knock your socks off at L'Adresse, but it's a solid spot to dine at if you're in the area. I would definitely consider this place for a quick yet comfortable and tasty lunch.",27,0.9962

There's a long list of items you can get, but on my initial visit I tried their 24k Gold Matcha soft serve ice cream in a strawberry cone. It was very flavorful and overall the richness of the matcha is very good in ice cream form on a hot day. Though the gold doesn't really taste like anything and it's just a bit of texture and for visual aesthetics. I am not really sure what the gold adds to the ice cream aside from the cool look and something unique they serve at Matcha n' More. I will probably be back and try some of their other items. Don't forget to ask for a stamp card, after 8 drinks or ice cream you'll get one free.",19,0.9224
90,15,10,4.0,"What a great find in the neighborhood! This place is fast, efficient and well-organized. I went on a Tues night around 6pm and ordering was a breeze. You can create your own poke bowl or order one of the ones they recommend. Either way, you get to add whatever extra toppings you'd like; however, some select items are an extra charge. I opted for one of their recommended poke bowl and added some extra freebie toppings. Lots to choose from! If you don't like raw salmon or tuna, you can have it grilled. Lots of different bases to choose from - brown rice, quinoa, salad, etc. They make it really easy for you to order. You fill out a card by selecting from a list of everything they have to offer. You can take your time filling out your card without the pressure of holding up the line (and getting dirty looks from hungry poke lovers!). Once your selections are made, simply bring the card to the order line. In a matter of minutes, your poke bowl is ready!Also, they have free lemon water, which is self-serve. Cool!All in all, i had a good ordering experience and a great poke bowl. I will definitely be back! Very satisfying and healthy meal!",19,0.9911

It's kind of a hidden gem way uptown on the west side and buried in Riverside Park off the 103rd street entrance. Walk down and over and you will see it overlooking the river.There is a small bar up top with outside seating offering great views. Walk the stairs down and there is another larger bar below level with both outdoor and some covered seating. Also offers great views of the river and sand volleyball courts. You can also find the bathrooms down here too.Decent beer list on tap and in bottles. Friendly bartenders serving up drinks. I was here last night to run a 5K race and was able to hang out and enjoy a post run beer and some eats. They also have a small menu of food items to choose from.So choice and the best thing about this place is that very few seem to know it's here other than those who live in the area - and no annoying tourists!,22,0.9591

They also have brown rice noodles as another gluten free option, in additional to regular noodles/ udon.The menu is huge and they also have bento boxes, salads, sushi and vegan gluten-free desserts! The entrees are $12-$15 range but may have to pay more for things like zucchini noodles, fish, etc. The portions are huge so overall pretty worth it.

93,11,9,4.0,"I'm so happy I got to experience what Anthony Bourdain raved so much about! Pastrami Queen is really something special. We came on a Friday night around 7pm, when the small eatery was surprisingly empty. You can place to-go orders at the counter, but they also have waiter service if you plan on eating there. The tables, chairs, sauce bottles, and walls are all just a little icky, but that's because this place has been around for 6 decades. If you can look past this (and I recommend you do), you can expect to have some pretty amazing Jewish deli.We had the Overstuffed Pastrami Sandwich ($18), a side of cole slaw ($4.95), and a Snapple ($2.60). The sandwich is composed of a 1/2 lb serving of pastrami on rye bread with a side of pickles. The meat was soooooo tender and tastes like it had been slow-cooking for hourssssss. The rye bread was softer and less dense than ones I am accustomed to, and didn't hold up to the meat too well. Expect to use your knife and fork. The cole slaw was also delicious and not too liquidy or mayo-y. The pickles were way too salty and almost had a fishy taste to it that I didn't like. Our waiter informed us that they sometimes have half sour pickles that might be more to my liking, but they didn't have any that day.Oh, and a word to the wise. Unless you're feeling ravenous or are part grizzly bear, order 1 sandwich and share with a friend. The serving sizes are very generous here.

Their menu is divided into classic section and more traditional Thai food section. We ordered two items from the traditional list - pad thai bolan and kaeng rawang neur bai cha poo (marinated beaf in a mix of two types of curry sources). Both dishes are good, especially the beaf. The beaf was very well braised and the curry tastes so good! Also tried the bua loy sawan (glutinous balls stuffed with coconut) for dessert, which was good as well.The restaurant put some thoughts into their decoration I guess, but it can get very noisy and hard to enjoy any conversations during busy time. Also, though their staffs are friendly, there was this one person wondering around and trying to take over the waiter's job for every table during random time of your meal, which was very weird and messes up the flow.

Just about any style you want, you can find. Many from local brewers.  The staff is great also.

If you had the Green Tea ice cream flavor before, you definitely want to try this flavor and enhance your ice cream tea flavor pallet.

Anyhow, he's already seen it three times and counting. We're really hoping for the sequel soon.The Shanghai bun and the juicy pork Xiao Long Baos (they call them Kung Fu buns here though) are the reasons we keep coming back. Yes, there is an automatic 15% service charge but I've never had any complaints of lousy service. Idk, maybe it helps that I actually speak Mandarin. They can get busy, the acoustics in this restaurant aren't the best and your ears may be ringing from the loud guys sitting in the corner next to you, but the food is good. I'd stick to their XLBs, scallion pancakes and the Shanghai buns (!) Although the noodles do look good, do not expect Japanese style ramen. ""La-mein"" (ra-men) technically means ""pulled noodle"" (hand-pulled in this case, which the owner is well-known for) so I can see where people would misinterpret the style of noodles they are expecting.

Oh, and my all-time favorite, saag paneer (otherwise known as delicious cubes of cheese in creamy spinach). And I can't handle anything above a medium spice level. The lassi was incredibly creamy and thick, as it should be.Don't have any complaints with what we ordered: the salmon curry, saag paneer, and one of the lamb dishes. I couldn't stop proclaiming how good everything was. A little on the salty side. The salmon and lamb chunks were incredibly tender and satisfying. The thing with Indian food is that it fills me up almost immediately. I tend to always keep eating even though I start hitting the satiety brick wall. The three of us ordered three entrees (that looked small-ish as they were being carried to the table) and a side of naan and couldn't finish everything. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and re-filled our rice bowls; the food came out quickly and piping hot; and there's a 20% discount if you check in on Yelp.

Depending on the day/performer, you'll have varying degrees of luck for getting in. It seems that the best way to guarantee getting in is to show up 30-45 min early. Reservation or not, if the space fills you're out of luck. That being said, the staff are cool and laid back and I've been able to scope out a spot in advance (even during the last song of previous show). However, during popular, busy shows the line / waiting outside is enforced more strictly. My favorite spot is the front of the bar - the two seats facing the stage! On my student budget, it's affordable and has a great view. The place is small so it really doesn't feel that far. Now onto food and drinks. As you can imagine, there's a nice mark up and I've always preferred to go to a bar in the area before hand and have just one or two drinks during the show. For food, I've tried the brunch and the cheese plate. Both are good, but if you have the option, I'd eat elsewhere first too. I found the hash browns to be mostly flavorless. The cheese plate had a good selection but the bread it came with was cold andhad raisins in it! Perhaps this is just not my taste but I didn't enjoy it that much. But of course at the end of the day, the Blue Note is an amazing mecca of music.

I would definitely come back again and again for this; am drooling now just thinking about this. We also got the Colony, since it seems like a popular choice, and it was great but not mind blowing. The honey is not overly sweet and the pickled jalapeños were not overly spicy so it made for a well-balanced slice. Nevertheless, it didn't hit the spot the way I thought it would - probably because I realized I'm not a big fan of the thick crust style of pizza and also Prince Street's Sicilian slice with pepperoni is the unbeatable number one in my heart. They have one dessert - a deconstructed s'mores, but this fell short for me.

I prefer their hot over cold sandwiches, especially the Pinocchio filled with prosciutto, sopressata, fresh mozz, sweet roasted peppers, and a pungent olive paste. The bread is a bit hard and the meats were salty, but definitely top-notch cured quality. Their donnoli pastry is a cross between a donut and cannoli.

I was told it would be prepared to order taking my allergies into consideration. If you're in the neighborhood have lunch and write a review. Be sure you get desert!,95,0.9957
111,11,4,4.0,"KenScale: 8.5/10It's been almost two years since my wife Jun and I had visited Le Coucou, a hit French restaurant behind chef Daniel Rose (who, as a Chicago-born American, made his name in Paris with a modern bistro called Spring) in partnership with restaurateur Stephen Starr. Too often (and sadly), when a restaurant opens in the city and receives all the buzz and accolade, it's hard to see the restaurant sustain that initial success. Part of that has to with notoriously fickle New York City diners who constantly move around to the next big openings. I, for one, am probably guilty, but once I got married, it's become more difficult to check out restaurants as frequently as I used to as I don't have the luxury (or even willingness, thanks to Jun who is a terrific cook herself) to dine out all the time. Another reason that a restaurant loses its momentum has to do with the fact that chefs constantly look around for the next opportunities and therefore do not always pay attention to their existing ventures with the requisite care. At least that doesn't seem to be the case for Le Coucou, which is still chef Rose's only restaurant (although his wife Marie-Aude Rose has her own restaurant in La Mercerie which we have yet to visit), getting a reservation is still as hard as the moment it opened, and it recently entered the World's Best Restaurant list at number 85. I've been meaning to go back to Le Coucou for a while now, and booked for an early dinner table before heading up to the Lincoln Center for a ballet show. And I am so glad that we did, as Le Coucou is still firing on all cylinders.Le Coucou's French cuisine is in that ideal state between classic and modern. No single dish jumps out at you with some gimmicks, but each dish that you can brings so much satisfaction with careful execution and balanced flavor and texture. Case in point: an outstanding dish of lobster and scallop stuffed cabbage with Pineau de la Loire (a/k/a chenin blanc) sauce. Once you open up the cabbage shell (which I didn't do as elegantly as I should have), you have a mixture of seafood that was expertly prepared, and the addition of wine sauce underneath, which tasted slightly sour at first but over time grew more and more interesting, worked beautifully with it. How about the French classic Sole Veronique, which the server enthusiastically recommended? It was more or less perfectly cooked, and the addition of grapes and champignons mushroom further enhanced the texture of the fish, while the creamy broth underneath was rich but not overpowering. At $63, the price is certainly not cheap, but then a dover sole dish is expensive everywhere in the city, so might as well have a great one, right? It was certainly one of the best seafood dishes I have had in a while. Jun and I weren't initially sold on the other main dish that we had in prime filet with bone marrow jus (as we thought the seasoning on the meat was a bit too aggressive to our taste), but complementing it with the side dish of hearty oxtail potatoes greatly helped to neutralize that sensation. For dessert, Jun and I hadn't had the Baked Alaska last time we had visited, but that was a mistake. The server poured the brandy on top of the dessert to create a beautiful blue flame that lasted for about 15 seconds. The result was a decadent pastry dish with perhaps a bit too much brandy (Jun winced as she realized what she was eating had the potent brandy), but still a very delicious one with pistachio ice cream inside.As noted above, getting a reservation for dinner tables, especially during prime teams, still requires a Herculean effort. The beautiful dining room that gives you a sense that you're at somewhere special without having to always show up in black ties was still as elegant as I had remembered on our first visit. There is full bar with French-centric wine list to complement your meal (they do make some really good Old Fashioned cocktails). New Yorkers can't seem to get enough of delicious French restaurants (Jun and I still need to visit newcomers such as the above-mentioned La Mercerie and Frenchette from the team that previously worked at Keith McNally restaurants), but when it comes to a restaurant that one must go to explore the rich culinary tradition of this beautiful country, Le Coucou will always stand out to me as a top candidate. May the restaurant thrive for a long, long time!",14,0.9993

With pork belly, you can't go wrong!- Jersey Giant - A very delicious roasted chicken- Mac n Cheese - very good- French Fries - tastyFor dessert,​ we had a very tasty meringue confection.

114,21,6,4.0,"The falafel was very good, and I wish I had ordered more since they were in the small side and only four of them. But they were soft and not over cooked, and just the right amount of moist. The flavor was subtle, but it was there. It also came with a tablespoon of tahini sauce on the side. The cauliflower was pretty good. I'm not sure I love the way it was cooked, but I had never tried it like that and decided to get it anyway. It also came with a tablespoon of tahini on the side. This lacked in flavor and found I wished I had more of the tahini to dip the cauliflower in. The Mediterranean chopped salad was just tomato, raw onion, cucumber, with parsley on top. The dressing was olive oil with lemon. I like that when it came (I ordered in), they were all separate and not mixed together. Everything I ordered happened to be vegan, but what would've been a great dressing for this would've been a light yogurt instead. It was still good, and it was refreshing to have after the falafel and cauliflower. I would order from here again, but next time I'll try other things on the menu.

115,26,10,4.0,"Flip Sigi has just renovated their menu and thankfully kept a number of dishes that I love. I've been to their restaurant a fair number of times and while not everything on their previous menu was a favorite, they seem to have found what works for them.First, the classics. My favorite burrito of theirs is the Cali Burrito, which is loaded with seared pork belly, chicken, avocado, and french fries. The textures and flavors work incredibly well together - and while it's great to share, I often wish I didn't have to. Their Plan B-Rito is now available on weekdays (it used to be a weekend-only item) and I love the addition of longanisa in the ingredients. The Dan Dan Noodles are also a favorite of mine, which utilize the typical ramen noodles in a ground pork-based sauce which is savory, spicy, and sweet.From the newer items, I would 100% recommend the Longanisa Poutine, which are generously portioned and are covers a pile of fries in melted cheese and longanisa sausage. It's a great dish to share but if you eat it all by yourself - hey, I don't judge. Also got to try the Wonton Nachos, which are a creative take on the typical nacho dish and substitutes wontons for the classic tortilla chip.It's a fairly casual place, so ideal for coming in with a friend or two or getting some food to go.",31,0.9898
116,15,7,4.0,"Nice addition to the area and a good option for Sunday lunch!WAIT: Came on a Sunday around 1:30 pm and there was no wait for the 2 of us. There are 2 larger tables for 4 people and then counter space that lines both facing the kitchen and facing the window AND an entire back area with more tables so it's pretty spacious inside.ATMOSPHERE: pretty simple inside, with an open kitchen. It's a slightly weird layout in that there is a front section with the kitchen and then a back section that I wasn't able to explore too much. It's bright and cheery.FOOD: They have lunch specials (on Sundays too!) that are available from 12-3:30. The menu is a bit more limited but their dishes are probably about $1-2 cheaper. They also have a promo right now that if you take a picture and post it on social media you either get a free kale salad or mocktail.Si-Lom Chicken Stewed Noodle - for $12, you get a huge leg of chicken (thigh + drumstick) plus wonton like egg noodles, soup and veggies in a bowl. The portions are small to medium so not the hugest amount but for a lunch it's satisfying enough. The soup is just OK, mostly tasted like a soy sauce based one dimensional soup. The noodles reminded me of the kind you get with wonton noodle soup (very thin and eggy). The chicken is like a stewed soy sauce chicken, tasty and a great addition. Just ask for a separate fork, knife and plate to help you eat it.Proong Tom Yum Noodle - husband got this, at $11 for the lunch special. It has pho like flat rice noodles in a more interesting slightly spicy broth. Comes with an egg, these wonton crunchies on the side and some pulled chicken breast on top. Pretty good, I think I would get that next time or something with rice noodles.Overall, good option if you are craving for a Thai noodle soup or something less traditional than your typical pad Thai. The lunch specials are good prices too!",15,0.9975

It came out quickly and was magnificent. I would definitely recommend splitting.The flavor of roasted tea soaked into the flaky ice well; the whipped cream had the light touch of lime zest. However, I think it ended up being too much of a good thing-- it was also stuffed with cream, so it ended up being heavy. The flavors started reminding of a root beer float.

118,21,5,4.0,"I found myself at Gyu-Kaku with some colleagues for happy hour drinks and apps. I've been to a few Asian barbecue restaurants before but this was my first time at this particular one. Even though Gyu-Kaku is a chain and initially made me go hmmmmm, I had heard good things so I was excited to try it out. Walking in around 5-ish on a Saturday, the place was pretty crowded but not crazy yet. Happy hour was going on in the entire restaurant until 6 and then only at the bar after that. Since we were just looking for happy hour and didn't want to move, we decided just to stay in the bar area. From what I can see, though, the restaurant looks typical of a do-it-yourself barbecue restaurant: woods contrasting with lighter colors, compartmentalized booths, etc. We ordered a number of apps - fries with sauce, Japanese-style fried chicken, fried calamari, fried bacon strips, shishito peppers, and shrimp dumplings. Looking back, it was a lot of fried stuff (oops) but everything was very tasty and with good flavor. I also partook in a cocktail and got a Tokyo Sunset - tasty, refreshing, fitting for the one warm day we were having in NYC. Service was good - even though it got pretty packed as the evening progressed, the staff was on top of it with all our drinks and food being cranked out at a good pace. Overall, I was impressed with Gyu-Kaku and would definitely return for happy hour and to try out their full-on barbecue experience.",24,0.9944

They also offer regular sizes or large sizes, depending on your appetite. I opted for their signature spicy ahi bowl (regular size) for $11.95...GREAT CHOICE!! First, you pick either white or brown rice; then they add salad; then they create your bowl with their signature ingredients (or just choose your own). The guy who was making my bowl said I could basically add whatever I wanted as well, so I added jalapenos because why not? This bowl was absolutely delicious! All the ingredients were fresh and tasty. I love that they have so many ingredients to choose from. Something for everyone!

When we arrived, there was a sweet young lady that greeted us and after I told her about my reservations she kindly escorted us to our table, it was our own lil corner near the bar, so we did have a group of guys kinda standing around near us having there beers. It didnt bother us because the place is really not that big and we were just amaze and astounded how great the place looked. Our waiter came to us right away, and had someone pour us our water, as we made our orders because the hostess had already givin us our menus when she brought us to our tables. To start we were dissapointed with the cocktail list for happy hour, I mean sorry, but some people dont always want to have beer and just wine. As a matter of fact the party I was with, none of us drink beer, unless you bringing me an ice cold bottle of Corona with a straw and a lime in it, but thats not what we were there for. We wanted a better cocktail selection, and yes they did have many cocktails but only two were apart of happy hour, and one of my friends didnt even drink hers, for she didnt like the taste. So we decided to get some white wine. Now down to the food.Grilled oysters - 4 stars, they were a lil pricey for 6, but they tasted really goodShrimp dumpling- 4 stars, they were cooked well and had an interesting crisp to themCrab tacos and Fish taco- 5 stars, nothing left to say.Paella - 4 stars, hot! pan was hot plse be careful.Fried ravioli and truffle fries- 3 stars, they were both o.k.I would say I would make a return here someday, but not today, plus I have plenty on my bookmarked list to visit.

A Yelp search brought us to a BOARD GAME CAFE. Whaaaaat?Even though they serve beer, this place is NOT a bar by any definition. They could do a better job of creating a more nightlifey atmosphere with the lighting and music, especially for the late-night crowd, but that might not be the audience they're targeting. They serve coffee drinks, smoothies, beers, and cafe snacks like muffins and pastries.Seating is mostly communal, though there are a few smaller 2-person tables. The walls are stacked floor to ceiling with just about every board game you can think of. They even have certain games for sale (new ones, of course).When we came on a Saturday night around 9:45pm, the price was $5 per person per hour ($20 per hour for my 3 friends and me), or $40 to play until closing time at midnight.

126,14,9,4.0,"New Ramen place in the heart of K-Town. My husband and I went here on a Wed night around 6:30 and the place wasn't packed compared to other restaurants in Ktown, but it was decently filled. It's a narrow place with a bar seating on the left when you enter. When you head to the back, there's a couple of tables for groups. We started our meal with the Chashu 'Pork' Buns (2 for $7.00). I was disappointed with how fatty the pork was and that it left my mouth feeling really greasy. In addition, we also tried the Shishito Peppers ($6.00). I'm not a fan of peppers, but found these rather satisfying due to the cheese on top and the sauce they mixed the peppers in. For the ramen, we ordered the Koku Ramen ($14.00) and Kimchi Tan Tan ($14.00). Both ramens had the right amount of noodles. Koku Ramen was the winner of the two. Its soup tasted light and buttery and it's noodle was a bit thinner than the other one. The Kimchi Tan Tan, I really wasn't a fan of it. It was spicy and extremely salty. In my opinion, it tasted like they decided to just add kimchi to the pork soup, which both together just makes it really salty, and then decided to add some more spicy flavoring on top. If you're not a fan of spicy food, I would highly not recommend this one. As for the service, it was decent. One waiter was really attentive and friendly, the other one really lacked at his job. We had to ask for water in the beginning, which was brought in this tiny cup; nice waiter had to keep refilling it after I couldn't stop drinking water from the spicy ramen.

I was not a fan of that, but I understand that instrumental Indian music which typically plays makes the restaurant sound boring and less trendy. Cute industrial style seating with black and gold colors. Service: No trouble at all with the service. I really appreciated that they changed our plates and cutlery after we transitioned from apps to dinner part of our meal.Price: We paid about 65 a person (with tip) for apps, dinner, and dessert including one drink each.

I think the white pizza sauce could've used maybe some garlic and basil in the sauce and the tomato sauce was more sweet than savory. Cost: CASH ONLY!!!! (which was annoying but they have an ATM, try to hit the bank before you come though to avoid the fees). The prices were very affordable and I thought they were adequate for the amount and quality of the pizza. Service: mehh, not bad but I think they struggle to check up on people with so much going on. But despite being super busy, pizza was out in less than 20 mins! Will I be back? Probably not. It's a cute little pizza place to bring your family or friends but nothing special. Loved the charming style with the picnic style set up (paper plates, checkered linens) but just a one time visit was enough.",27,-0.5344

So when one opens up nearby, trust------us Dominicans go nuts and wanna try it out. Took notice when John M. visited then I wanted a piece of that itty bit of action too. You'll miss this place if you're zooming down White Plains Rd. Heads up- Ajo is right in between an auto body shop and a Barber. But their rustic wood exterior, is a unique and dead giveaway for these parts. Ajo Y Oregano's first impressions took me way back to my Homeland: hearing rain hit the typical Tin roof, colorful window shutters, Caribbean furniture and walls. Ajo is small. Only 3 tables- seating 4-5 people comfortably on each. No reservations taken. But my Mom and I lucked out and practically a table waited for us. But if you so happen to come when there's a crowded house, Ajo has a makeshift waiting list taped on the wall. Place is casual and Salsero Frankie Ruiz's music, took it way back while we lunched. Started with good Arepitas de Yuca (Yuca Fritters) and Bacalaítos. Other than good taste, I guess the cook didn't drain the excess oil in the Cod Fish Fritters and by the time they got to the table, they were real oily. Mom had Mondongo with a side of white rice, shared a salad with the butteriest Avocado and I had the Garlic Shrimp and a side of Tostones. My dish was tasty with mostly a mix of Large and baby shrimp (odd- I thought). And Garlic-Cream Sauce, was just way too much for me. Our waitress was pleasant but wasn't efficient and my Country Club soda, came past midway our lunch. By the way, keep an eye for whatever's not flowing with you. I really appreciate how Ajo isn't totally breaking the rules on old school, Dominican food or taste. Everybody has a good time here and Food is good. Be considerate and remember...place is tight.

I had stopped by this chic restaurant last year for a Yelp event, and had such a fantastic time that I decided to give them a try on a regular night.My friend and I arrived a few minutes after our reservation time. The seating hostess greeted us warmly and sat us down immediately. Our waiter walked over shortly and welcomed us to the restaurant. He kindly explained the menu and recommended some of the popular menu items. My friend and I tried the escargot as the appetizer. Drenched in a garlic-parsley butter, these delicacies were absolutely delicious and perfect to get us started for the feast to come. After that, we shared the 36 oz dry-aged tomahawk rib-eye. The steak was cooked perfectly and the portion was very generous. I loved the roasted bone marrow that came with the steak. The waitstaff made sure that we had plenty of bread to soak up this fatty goodness at all times. I really appreciate the restaurants that pay attention to small details like this, and it really made my dining experience special.The dining area is intimate, making it an ideal place for a romantic date night. In addition, the restaurant is quite spacious (a rare find in New York City) and therefore can easily accommodate large parties. I would absolutely recommend hosting your next holiday dinner party at this elegant yet trendy restaurant. From the impeccable service to delicious food, I would absolutely recommend Boucherie if you want to combine your love for steak with classic French dishes and wine.

Fun atmosphere, funky wallpaper, trendy neon sign with a clever saying. I've seen it, but it will always attract the instagrammers and foodies. Now, I would have given this gimmicky shop less stars, but I really did enjoy my experience. The green tea ice cream is really good, not too sugary. The matcha is the right amount of sweetness.

I let my wife choose a preset mix of toppings and even though it was enjoyable I would have preferred other toppings. From what we did get the fruit was fresh but found it odd to have corn flakes as a topping. It was lighter than ice cream and served as a ideal treat in a hot day.Value - average/high, ~$12 for yeti sized sundae.

And it was chilled perfect on these hot summer days! The tofu was a lot and really filling! The best part is the red bean which is delicious! Their red beans are chewy but not hard and soft but not mushy. It's like the perfect texture mixed with the syrup yumm. I'd love more syrup ratio. The service here is great. They helped me with what to order and they were really lenient about sitting. We moved a chair and they didn't mind.

147,14,2,4.0,"TLDR: quaint French bistro with smaller portioned plates; fast service; cramped seating; famous for their steamed eggs, but also offer other delicious breakfast options; come during the weekday for no waitAfter hearing multiple friends rave about the steamed eggs here, decided to finally try Buvette on a Tuesday morning around 9:45am. The restaurant was reasonably busy for a weekday morning, but my friend and I were able to grab seats at the bar right away, where we could watch the steamed eggs being made using the espresso machine. The waiter was very friendly and poured us water / took our orders promptly.We both ordered the famous jambon cru (steamed eggs and prosciutto with shaved parmesan served on toast). While I prefer my eggs over easy and generally don't like scrambled eggs, I decided that I should give this dish a try after hearing so many positive things about it. While I liked that the dish had a variety of different textures, I found the eggs to be too mushy and the prosciutto to be overly salty. However, the portion size was spot on, unlike most breakfast / brunch places where leftovers are usually a given. My friend was extremely bothered that I only found the dish to be okay (he thinks the steamed eggs are phenomenal), and insisted that we come back to Buvette another time so that I could try a different dish.The following week, we returned with another friend at 9:15am on a Friday. This time, we were seated at a very small table near the back, which left little space for our coats and purses. I decided to share the croissants with butter & raspberry jam with one of my friends and then ordered the belgian waffle (buttermilk waffle, berries, & creme fraiche). The croissants were good, but not unlike others I've tried before. On the other hand, the belgian waffle was simply delicious--the waffle itself was cooked perfectly, the berries on top were ripe and tart, and the creme fraiche and powdered sugar added an element of sweetness to the dish that truly made it a treat.I'm glad I gave this place a second try and would recommend it for both those who love scrambled eggs and those who don't, as the steamed eggs aren't the only thing on the menu worth trying.",17,0.998

149,11,4,4.0,"KenScale: 8.5/10If you look at the menus of the recently opened The Loyal and other restaurants like Narcissa or Nix, you wouldn't know they are all from the same chef. John Fraser has long been known for one of the best chefs in New York City for his exciting vegetable-centric cooking, and everywhere I go, his restaurants didn't disappoint for the kitchen's ability to maintain balance in creativity and execution as well as its commitment to ingredients. When I heard that he was opening a more straightforward American bistro last year, I was somewhat puzzled. Is chef Fraser playing safe like many others in the city who are facing the crunch from soaring rents and labor costs? The Loyal's menu doesn't really seem to have a distinct identity like chef Fraser's other restaurants; it has a bunch of crowd-pleasers with heavy focus on meat. Well, my recent dinner with my wife Jun at the restaurant proves that even if a more ""boring"" concept, chef Fraser surely knows how to pull it off beautifully. The menu at The Loyal is divided into raw bar and bar snacks, appetizers, pastas and entrees. Any meal at the restaurant should absolutely start with the delicious bites of drunken eggs with chili oil and sesame that had a pleasant mix of spicy and sweet sensation all mixed up wonderfully. Lobster cocktail with smoked tomatoes was another winner that you should consider kicking off your meal with. For a chef who has made his name for vegetable dishes, chef Fraser has quite impressed both of us for the two meat entrée dishes we had ordered. The burger with comte and ""22-step"" tomato was perfectly cooked medium rare and its richness was even more impressive considering that the seasoning itself was kept at an optimal level. Add a side of duck fat tots, and you have one of the best new burgers in town. When I saw the beef tenderloin covered in salsa verde béarnaise sauce, I regretted that I didn't tell the server to bring the sauce on the side. To my surprise, the béarnaise wasn't too strong in seasoning and its subtle flavor actually enhanced the very nicely grilled tenderloin, accompanied by stuff mushrooms on the side for a fantastic meat dish. Jun and I had no problem making a quick work of both the burger and the beef tenderloin. For dessert, the Sonoma harvest sundaes with concord grape and yogurt sorbets accompanied by delightful honeycomb crunch led us to conclude without reservation that The Loyal is a very good restaurant. Getting a reservation at The Loyal could be difficult during prime times on the weekend, so always book in advance. Service was overall good although Jun was a little upset that the hostess tried to lead us to the table right next to the door (on a freezing Sunday evening) even though there were other tables for two on the inner part of the restaurant. There is full bar with some aptly concocted cocktail selections (there was one called Willy Wonka with Korean chocolate stick called pepero). The restaurant's vibe is that of a typical West Village bistro that works for multiple occasions (Jun and I could tell that all the people sitting on our rows of tables for two were either couples or on a date). The Loyal may not be the most exciting dining destination to visit right now, but if you want to walk out with a satisfying dinner, it is definitely a place I would recommend checking out.",13,0.9959

151,15,5,4.0,"Up until about 2 days ago, I had no idea that Detroit, like New York and Chicago had their own classification of pizza. This was one of the suggested pizza places that Yelp recommended to me, so I decided to give this place a try for dinner tonight. Upon walking in, you're greeted with trays upon trays of pizzas with different toppings and colors. The little ""pepperoni cups"" caught my attention, so I opted for the pepperoni pizza. The pepperoni that they use here reminded me of the pepperoni that is used over at Prince Street Pizza and Grimaldi's. These pepperonis are essentially small cups that capture the char and the delicious oils that are left over after being heated up in the hot oven. I'd definitely recommend asking for extra pepperoni as you can never have enough of it! What makes Detroit pizza unique from any other pizza is that it is served in a long rectangular box and the dough is especially crispy. Other than that, the pizza here reminded me of the Spicy Spring at PSP, just without the slightly sweetened dough.If you asked me, I'd still prefer Prince Street Pizza over this place. It doesn't fall far behind though. Its just that PSP set the standard so high for me haha. The slightly sweetened dough gave PSP the slight edge. Overall, I had an excellent first experience here. According to several of the Yelp reviews, this place is run by the same folks from Artichoke's Pizza. They're obviously up to big things and playing a huge role in the pizza culture here in N.Y. I'd definitely recommend this place if you haven't been here before. Side note: I finally figured out why this place has the name it has after giving it a second thought. It's named after the football and baseball teams based in Detroit. Clever indeed.",12,0.9846
152,13,6,4.0,"Came here on a Friday evening at 745pm - my hubby, me and two friends (a couple). Place is very swanky. It is a relatively small dining room but it's cozy, and skews between romantic or a corporating outing feel. They have live music (classic jazz, and a nice rooftop for pricey but good drinks. We couldn't go up because the weather was icky. Also, I suggest coming on a Friday because they have a $42 pre fixe, and also I easily booked on OPT and somehow got a 1000 points. Think it's more of a work feel here given the area so they're probably trying to get more on a Friday. I did have the pre fixe menu, and I got the:- Delicious French Onion Soup - awesome beef broth flavor, crusty cheese atop yum. Probably the best FO soup i ever had (it's so messy to eat!) -The bacon wrapped filet mignon. Med rare. It was more on the rare side but that was fine by me. No one should get a steak more than med rare, lol. Honestly not sure the bacon - I'm not sure that it added much flavor and I normally go nuts for steak house bacon (it was steak house style just more cooked and crisped). The filet however was great! It came wth blue cheese atop. It looked like a small portion but was great for me. -Came with pomme anna which is a kind of a potato gratin type of thing, was yummy. I would have preferred a vegetable but alas they can't substitute for the pre fixe. Most others I was dining with got the pre fixe as well. The main being the filet mostly. My hubby got the wagyu beef stew, but it wasn't really a stew. It was like beef tips with root veggies on top of potato so that should have been clarified cause he was trying to do few carbs.As far as the appetizers; there were a lot of the octopus salad (delicious, grilled), and the root veggies salad (meh). The octopus salad or FO soup would be the best choices.We shared delicious, hearty vidalia onion rings for the table. They could have used more flavor but they were well fried and held up.The pre fixe comes with a good choice of desserts, and since we all got it we shared. Among a chocolate mousse, cake thing - I'm not a fan of chocolate so this wasn't for sure. Then, a grapefruit shaved ice thing with ice - tart and refreshing. Then, probably my favorite, strawberry shortcake which was not too sweet and on a biscuit. Came with green apple sorbet. You can wash it down with some good quality coffee.For $28 you can also do a sommelier wine pairing with the pre fixe, where you get two glasses of wine paired with what you're having. You can make a request on the style of wine you like but they will choose for you. I got a cab and.. I forget the other maybe syrah or shiraz. My other gf did the same and got a cab and rose. The men got amongst cocktails like Old Fashioned, and/or a large selection of bourbons. I could see this being a great space for events. I will say - if not for the pre fixe, they place is very very expensive. I would argue more expensive than a lot of steakhouses that have real street cred in NYC. But it is a nice ambiance.",15,0.9982

The bakery is conveniently located in East Village, and while the space isn't very large (there isn't really space to dine in, so you'll need to take your treats to go) there definitely is a full range of items to choose from.I was able to try their Taro Coconut cupcake, and the cake itself is unbelievably moist (soaked in coconut milk, I think?) and the buttercream is light and has just the right amount of sweetness. I also loved their panna cotta, which is topped with a guava jam on top which adds just a little tartness to counteract the denseness of the dessert.The owners are super sweet and it's clear they've put in a lot of work into their items.

154,19,7,4.0,"One of my colleagues and I decided to grab some dinner; he left location up to me so I took to my bookmarks to find somewhere equidistant where we can meet and catch up. Jacob's Pickles had been sitting in my bookmarks for some time so I suggested we try it out. Jacob's Pickles is a trendy brunch and dinner spot on the Upper West Side. Their main fare is Southern comfort food, and the interior tries to augment that in a way by serving us low lighting (too low for me personally), metal fixtures, and light stone pared with darker woods. The restaurant starts out kind of narrow with a bar to the right and some tables to the left but opens up to a broader dining room in the back. They play modern music which doesn't add to the aesthetics much but makes the place more lively. They do not take reservations for parties less than 6, when we arrived at ~6:30 on a Sunday night the wait was about 30 minutes for a party of two. They took my number and texted me when the table was ready. As the name suggests, Jacob's offers a variety of pickles in addition to their Southern dishes. Additionally, many of their entrees come with pickles or have them incorporated in some way. The menu structure is traditional with apps, salads, sandwiches, and entrees. The sandwiches stood out to me since they were all served on biscuits - ooh! I decided to get the honey chicken and pickles sandwich. This contained buttermilk fried chicken, hot sours, and clover honey served on a biscuit with a side of grits. The sandwich was pretty good and quite generous in size - you would think by the sound of it the meal would be heavy but it wasn't at all. The chicken was juicy, the biscuit was light and fluffy, and I could really taste that honey. Because of the size of the sandwich and the delicateness of the biscuit, I ate it with a fork and knife - no biggie (actually I preferred that ;-). The cheese grits the sandwich was served with had good flavor, though I was puzzled as to why it was served in such a deep bowl - you had to reach in to get that cheesy goodness. Service was good; our waiter was friendly and our food came out in a timely manner. Overall, I had a good time at Jacob's - they serve tasty, quality food with friendly service in a trendy atmosphere. That being said, I don't know how destination-worthy this place is. I'm glad I experienced it, but this isn't a place I would be waiting hours to get a table at for brunch or dinner. It's worth trying if you're in the area, and if given the opportunity I would return.",19,0.9964

Large, piping hot dishes of love that you really shouldn't finish but you do because you don't want to disappoint (millions of gluttons were born this way). The owner can often be found cooking in the back. A warm slice of sweet potato pie is almost always offered as dessert because it's house made and a true delight. If you've lived in Harlem long enough you'd remember that there was an incarnation of this resto on 135th between 7th & 8th Avenues. This pie and this owner cling to ones memory like the food will cling to your heart, in a good way of course.By the way, this is a non-tipping establishment. This didn't stop me from leaving a tip because the hospitality is like nowhere else. Be warned, this is not a place to hop in and out of for a quick meal. If you come here, you're welcome to linger and get comfortable whether at a booth or at the counter. There is a sign that will subtly let you know that fresh pressed/squeezed juice is also made here. Oh the juiciest of oranges and strawberries and sweet bananas and crisp-green kale (!!) can be assuredly found here. Settle in and feed your body. You will surely enjoy all that is to be found here.

156,18,7,4.0,"FINALLY got to try this place! If you don't know, it was Danny Meyer's first restaurant back in 1985 (the same guy as Shake Shack) and very popular. It underwent some renovations within the past year so I wasn't able to visit but now it's open again.WAIT: Came on Easter Sunday and was able to get seated right away for a table for 2 at 6:30 pm. It was decently crowded but still had a good amount of space. There's an upstairs and downstairs so I think it can fit a lot of people.ATMOSPHERE: This is definitely not the most cutting edge, trendy restaurant that is in New York. This has more of an old school vibe and let me tell you...we were probably the youngest people in that restaurant.  I could see this as a good option for business lunches or dinners or to take your parents to a nice restaurant or somewhere for people to go on their 20th anniversary. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is ""fancy"" in that it has white table cloths and good service.FOOD: The prices are a little on the higher side at the cheapest thing being the side dishes at $14 per dish. The appetizers themselves are almost 20+! We opted for the USC burger and a side of the roasted carrots.BREAD - it's free! came with 3 slices of their rustic sourdough, the perfect kind with a thick soft inside and then crunchy, crusty bread with a bit of a toasted taste to it. Whipped butter and salty olives on the side make for a great beginning course.USC BURGER - since this is the same person who helped found shake shack we knew we had to try the burger. We got it medium rare. The burger itself is a decent size, for 1 person finishing it you'd be pretty full by the end. We got it medium rare and they definitely follow the medium rare request. It was pink inside and very juicy, soft, and not dry or overcooked. The meat was good quality with just the right amount of fat, although not overly seasoned or that flavorful. It might be because it didn't want to overwhelm customers with the bacon + cheese. The bacon is a little crispy with a good amount of fat, very taste and the cheese is almost like a sharp cheddar, melted on top. A brioche bun on top makes for a very good burger. At $29, it wasn't as good as Emily and it was probably a notch below Minetta Tavern, but it's still up there. I think one negative thing was the whole burger felt a TAD too greasy. The burger juices and bacon grease soaked the bottom of the bun and at the end I felt a little greased out. FRIES - the fries were your typical slightly browned medium thickness fry with a very potato taste. It's hard to describe, but it was not the kind I like.Note that this restaurant is a no tipping restaurant so I assume the tip is kind of built into the prices. It's sort of nice but something to keep in mind since the prices may seem a bit higher than others.Overall, definitely would recommend trying at least once and if I had another business lunch or dinner or parents visiting from out of town I might take them here.",15,0.9981
157,14,7,4.0,"It was one of those days where I was craving Vietnamese food so I ordered a classic dish: pho! It was #4 Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach (Combination Rice Noodle Beef Soup with Fresh Eye of Round, Brisket, Tendon and Omosa). The pho broth was just right - flavorful and light without tasting too salty. The various types of meat in it was well cooked too. I thought it was a fine bowl of noodles for $7.50. There is an option to size up your pho by ordering the Combination Extra Big Bowl options but the regular size bowl itself is just as filling to me. If I were to judge a restaurant by one dish out of their whole menu...this might be one of the slightly better Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown. This place has plenty of tables with a brick interior that has a funky decor that includes mirrors, neon lights, religious statues and Asian rooftop.

For the second thin cut we had the Nurst-Et special which comes with a cool presentation and it was also tasty (but when something is bathed is butter, it is difficult for it to taste bad).Thick cut: The ottoman: Most filling steak.

159,14,7,4.0,"Sometimes, you just want a casual quick food with strong flavor, instead of formal restaurant dining. We have been wanting to visit this spot for a while, so we decided to give them a try. Although they didn't have many customer in the inside, the kitchen was in full steam. It seems like they have lots of delivery orders. They only have counter table that goes all the way around. This is a self-service spot, no waiter service. The way you order the noodle dish is to first pick the noodle style, then the preparation style, and finally, choose the level of spiciness. I went with Ribbon Noodles, Spicy Cumin Lamb, and Low spicy. If you are vegetarian, this dish can be made with seitan also.It was a pretty good portion, lots of Ribbon Noodles and chunks of lamb meat which was tender and packed with flavor. The spice level was great for me. Not too spicy but had a little kick to it. My hubby ordered the same thing, but with different style of noodle. He chose Ding Ding Noodles, which is chopped noodles. The Ding Ding noodles are their house favorite, and it can be described as mini Chinese gnocchi. In addition to our noodles, we also ordered Mama's Jumbo Dumplings to share. We chose Pork & Chive. They took a long time to come out, we were almost done with our noodles about the time dumplings came out. They were nice size, but I wouldn't call it ""jumbo""...but certainly tasty and filling.It ended up being not-so-quick food, but we were not in any rush, so that was ok. The food was really good, much better than I expected. The price point is not ""fast-food"" price, but you do get delicious, quality food here that are made from scratch.",14,0.989

The bar area is a comfortable place to grab a cocktail or two if you're waiting for your party to arrive. They also have a small but good draft list, with a strong leaning toward locals. 5 Boroughs IPA was on offer, which I happily quaffed for the duration of my meal.The menu is definitely one of the better ones you'll see, with a nod to southern fried cooking. We started with cornbread, which was probably the most memorable part of the meal. It was hot, wholesome, and melted in your mouth, very much unlikely standard cornbread or hush puppies. The chicken dishes are outstanding, though orverpriced due to the celebrity factor. My shrimp and grits was spot on, with perfectly cooked, soft grits. We had three kids in our party and they were satisfied with their thick french toast--a feat not easy to pull off.Service was pretty good for such a busy brunchery. Halfway through our meal a singer swept through the room, serenading us and selling CDs. Might be worth a visit to the Supper Clu downstairs where food comes with music.",14,0.9949

I am going back to this place very shortly for more cheese ddukbokkee. God, I already miss it and it's only been a couple of days. However, their soju cocktail was way too sweet and not worth the $40 price tag for a bottle. $40 for a cocktail that has one bottle of soju and yogurt flavored mixer? Come on... Well, we could barely taste the soju, which made it worse. I won't return here for their drinks but will definitely return for their food and service.

The red soup base is very spicy, but not overwhelming. Great flavor too, as I didn't even need the dipping sauce. Wide variety of ingredients, as well as some very authentic Sichuan specialties. Overall I was very impressed with this place. The reason why it's not a five star is the price. Definitely the most expensive hot pot I have ever had.",14,0.9081

Now I know that you guys are prob thinking that that was a really bad idea, but let me reassure y'all, it was a fan-freaking-tastic one because those flavors were DELISH and thankfully not *too* boozy enough to kill us whew (but rest assured to all my fellow alcoholics, they were DEF boozy enough so we felt like we were actually getting our moneys worth). We shared an ice cream flight of Cake Batter Vodka Martini, Strawberry Rhubarb Bourban, Tequila Mexican ""Hot"" Chocolate + Strawberry White Sangria Sorbet and man, they were all pretty tasty. Being the tequila loving bish that I am, my favorite was ofc the Tequila Mexican ""Hot"" Chocolate which had just enough tequila to make the ice cream even more tasty and fun.

We were lucky enough to snag a table. The menu has lots of variety but we both chose to go with the classic cheese steak with whiz and onions, along with their beer battered onion rings. The onion rings came out first and was served with a chipotle mayo dipping sauce, which was delicious; however the rings were great on their own as well. Next came our cheese steaks - they were huge! For my personal taste, I thought it was really good but I would have liked a little more whiz and onions. My friend thought it was perfect the way it was. We both thought it was a tad bit too salty.Lots of TV screens (on mute) all over the bar; music playing in the background. On the night we were there, there was an extremely LOUD crowd at one of the tables which made the entire bar just too LOUD. But other than that, there was good atmosphere, great service (especially considering how busy it was). Next time, I'll have to try some of their other menu items and their happy hour specials!",17,0.9959

Scallion pancakes by themselves are $4, and pork buns come in a few different spins. It's a young fun staff. The combo special on my visit was two buns and curry fries for $12, which although too much for one, might be perfect for two. Bar stool dining only but you won't mind too much.",21,0.9775
168,20,14,4.0,"I was brought here by a friend of mine where we were debating where the best ramen spot in NYC was. Naturally, this was on the list and it belongs on that list.The place is rather small and always packed with people. I had to wait for a table to clear up to be seated for about 15 minutes. Must be worth the wait as three other groups are also waiting.We pretty much got whatever seat was available at this point so we took two seats by the bar area I guess you can call it looking into the kitchen. I got the spiciest ramen they had to offer which was the Volcano Tonkotsu Ramen. It had 6 peppers next to the name so it sounded dangerous. I also shared Steamed Pork Buns which came out first as they were appetizers which were tasty. The ramen was spicy alright, but I wouldn't say 6 pepper spicy. I was sweating after finishing the entire bowl, but was expecting to be in pain, so I guess that is a good thing! The portion of the bowl was enormous and really filling.Summary: If you're looking for an ramen spot in West Harlem, don't mind the wait, and you're really hungry (hopefully not hangry), voila!",20,0.7936

Jeju noodle bar's broth is one I crave and I would go back after my first experience.Clean, modern restaurant with good service and quality food. Menu is quite simple with hot/cold apps and three types of ramyun. Interesting fact: no servers, but the food is brought to the table by the cook! *Chicken Wing: Comes with six pieces, crispy skin and well cooked. Seasoning was your typical chicken wing plus more korean spice. It's not the soy-garlic or honey mustard sauce, just for reference.*So Ramyun: comes in a cute stone pot, veal broth with combination of rare and medium rare thin beef slices and bean sprouts. Noodles were cooked through, kinda wish they were al dente so they can cook with the residual heat from the broth. Broth was memorable. Kind of reminds of me Korean soulungtang because it is very hearty and flavorful. This was my fav of the night.*Gochu Ramyun: don't be alarmed, its not pepper broth and it's not super spicy either. Broth was okay on this one, based on the broth, I recommend the so ramyun over the gochu ramyun. The torched pork belly was very good. Outside was crispy and inside was soft and tender. Recommend if you are in the mood for good classic ramyun with delicious pork belly. Interior is truly beautiful. I love the open layout and the kitchen merges with the bar. I love the wall decorations that have various plates and barware. Minimalist feeling yet modern chic vibe that is suitable for dates and casual meet ups.",18,0.9901
171,8,5,4.0,"CHEESE. GLORY.I made reservations several weeks in advance because I'd heard the wait times can be pretty lengthy. My friend was running late on the Tuesday night we visited, so I was asked to wait at the bar. Even though their policy is to only hold a table for up to 15 minutes, we were seated promptly when my friend showed up about 25 minutes after our reservation time, which was greatly appreciated. Furthermore, service was surprisingly efficient for such a small space.Their drink menu consists of beer and wine only, which makes sense since those pair better with cheese than cocktails. The food menu is equally as uncomplicated; there are sandwiches (tartines and croques), raclettes, and a couple of additional entrée dishes. There were a couple of items that I knew we HAD to try because they were unique and had been incredibly hyped up on social media. We ordered two sandwiches and one raclette to share. The fig tartine ($14) was a delicious balance of sweet and savory and so unique--an absolute must-try. The croque madame ($14), a grilled ham and cheese sandwich with a perfectly fried egg on top, was also very good, but flavors were more predictable. Both sandwiches came with a side of arugula.And finally, the pièce de résistance, the raclette was of course out of this world. We selected the Suisse Complete ($27), which came with potatoes, cornichons, white pearl onions, arugula, 2 baguette slices, and 4 different cured meats. From the 5 raclette cheeses we got to choose from, we went with the black truffle (+$3). The cheese was very mild and didn't taste much of truffle, which was a little disappointing. The texture of the cheese was great though, very smooth, and went very well with the starchy potatoes. Pro tip: eat while warm.",17,0.9762

Expect to get well acquainted with your party, as well as the surrounding patrons as it was elbow to elbow when we arrived. I made it a point to mentally note all the exit signs just in case, that's how overly crowded it was. Aside from that, the atmosphere is dark and cozy, kinda speakeasy dark. The apps that were ordered by a few in the crew looked really good. I got a chance to taste the Lamb Nachos, they were made fresh and were not your typical tasting or looking nacho. These included a thin crisp chip topped with tender shredded lamb, goat cheese drizzle, siracha, cilantro and another component, very flavorful and addictive. Good amount of time afforded to HH from 4-8pm. Having a quick fast barkeep managing the many orders of drinks and small plates was impressive considering the huge crowd.Thanks to Dino K for putting this UYE together. Haven't seen Dino in many years, so it was nice to catch up. It was also great to hang with Yelp friends and meet other Yelpers.

It started getting more lively around 7 though! The drinks and food are alright, but I definitely think the atmosphere is what makes this restaurant great. This place looks classy but still casual and fun. Our waitress was SOOO nice and very funny. She checked up on us quiet often even when things started to get busy. The punch bowl was definitely not very strong, but it tastes pretty good. A little too sugary for me but if you're looking for a drink without too much alcohol, this is a good one to go with. We shared it with three people, even though it says ""served two"". They honor the buy one get one margarita on yelp deal! And the margaritas are VERY strong. They don't use mix apparently but only stevia, which definitely makes the margarita healthier (probably not, but sometimes it's okay to lie to yourself). Their guacamole is SO GOOD. They mash it in front of you and it is absolutely delicious. Hands down the best thing in the restaurant. Empanadas are okay, they weren't that warm when they came out and quite dry. The flavor was not bad though. The nachos are monstrous! Can get very messy, but they taste alright. My friends and I thought the beans in the nachos tasted really good. Overall I would definitely come back. This place is a good spot to hang with your friends after work and get a few drinks.",15,0.9987

Everything was good.The drink selection is a little weak, but there was enough options to choose from. There was no menu to take inside and only limited choices on the overhead. This is one of those places that don't take debit/credit, so you need to have cash. The staff was friendly and welcoming. Who I think was the owner was very friendly. There's a decent amount of seating inside. There's metered parking and side streets and you can usually find a spot, though when the church is in session or one of the 2 schools is having a function, it's a lot more difficult.

The selection of seafood and varieties of their preparation is wonderful to experience. Any non-Asian place that has enough confidence with their fish quality to prepare it raw is a indication of the freshness and confidence of its ingredients. The only minor complaint is having to wait when there seems to be open tables and a reservation was made. I feel it's more of a protocol than anything else.

Hakutou Jelly, one of their signature items, is a soft white peach jelly with incredibly smooth texture. Best served chilled, it's light and refreshing - like a slice of peach in the summer. Their mochi is quite special as well. I typically do not like mochi due to its chewy texture, but these are extremely delicate, with just the right amount of sweetness. At the time of writing, they offer Hakutou (white peach), matcha, and mango flavors.Like many Japanese goods, each dessert is beautifully wrapped, making these delicacies an ideal gift.

178,11,7,4.0,"I'm sooo conflicted on whether to give Natsumi 3 or 4 stars but I'm rounding up. Natsumi is a slightly nicer alternative to the other relatively cheapish sushi places on Seamless so I've started exclusively ordering from here whenever I have the craving. The lunch bento boxes are almost impossible to beat for the value - with an entree (I love the chicken katsu but the teriyaki is good too), white rice, some edamame, a california roll, and veggie tempura for like $12, it's impossible to beat. The three roll special ($16) that comes with edamame is also one of my go-to orders. I love how there are so many rolls to choose from for the special too - I usually get a spicy tuna, yellowtail jalapeno, and a california roll. All in all, Natsumi is a very welcome alternative to the other sushi places on Seamless.I'm taking off a star because of some major delivery issues I've had. I've noticed that it only happens when I place a ""future"" order on Seamless (which I tend to do here because it doesn't show up on Seamless until noon so I like to place my order as soon as possible). I won't get a confirmation email, and I'll call the restaurant and they swear they never received my order. They have been very flippant and rude about this in the past and last time it happened they blatantly hung up on me. I've had to go through Seamless Corporate care twice now because of the service issues. Another less-than-appealing experience: the last time I ordered, the sushi did not taste fresh at all. I ordered a piece of uni as a special treat and it was so rancid that I'm gagging just thinking about it. I'm going to disregard this experience as an anomaly though. TL;DR: FIX YOUR FAX MACHINE.

182,16,9,4.0,"On a rainy Sunday, sometimes you just want to curl up in a ball on your couch and watch netflix. Other times you want to head out and enjoy the much emptier city with a rain jacket and umbrella and ultimately end up at brunch. This past Sunday played out exactly like that. We had looked up a pulsd deal and Bazar piqued our interest. After getting out of class, we wandered down to 26th street and got ourselves a table at Bazar. I love the way this restaurant is decorated. The old school mirrors and colors were perfect. The smaller front opens up to a larger back area which is where we decided to sit. The 90 minutes included bellinis, mimosas and bloodies. I opted for bellinis and was pleasantly surprised that the service did not slow down. If my glass was empty, our server was ready to bring us another round, which is refreshing after a few past lackluster brunches. We decided to start our meal with the beet salad (not included in the deal) but it was well worth the extra money. It was delicious and I rarely see labneh so I was thrilled to get it. I got the croque madam for my entree. It is served on a baguette which was delicious and unexpected (my only complaint is that the under side of the bread was hard to cut through so perhaps ask for a sharper knife next time). The ham and cheese were great quality. The side salad had a lovely mix of small colorful tomatoes which was a nice bite of acidity to balance all the cheesy goodness. I will definitely be returning here for brunch. Everything was really tasty and the staff were all very friendly and welcoming. Even without the deal, brunch is 29.99, which is a great deal for booze and an entree.",18,0.9966

Now of course when you come to black tap you HAVE to get one of their FAMOUS shakes. My friend wanted the cotton candy shake, which would've probably been my last choice, but whatever... cotton candy shake it was. When the shake came out, I had to wonder to myself if people actually drink the shakes and eat all the toppings.

I want babushka's cooking, dammit! Onegin doesn't disappoint. Yes, it's fancy-fied, but it still tastes like home.The good part about private events is the buffet, so I've sampled many dishes.

Okay, admittedly, I need to bone up on my Greek menu knowledge some more. Voula NYC definitely dished out some education to me! From small plates to large dishes to potent and unique cocktails, Voula NYC dished out some amazing dishes in a sexy ""date night"" environment. Starting at the bar, I tried Penelope's Cobweb - it's a bit Pimm's Cup-like with a spicier bite - and I tried a friend's Always On Sunday - like a White Russian appearance-wise with a unique creamy nutty flavor - and both were great, though I favored the former drink much more. Moving onto apps, I had tzatziki - BUT OF COURSE - and some spicy feta with pita bread and Koulouri, a unique Greek bagel-shaped bread sprinkled with sesame seeds. The Lahanosalata was a crisp salad made with finely shredded cabbage, parsley, mint and sesame seeds in lemon-olive oil dressing topped w/ kefalograviera cheese; needless to say, I felt super healthy while eating it. Ha! It's so incredibly refreshing and counters any heavier dish there extremely well. Pan-seared feta, crusted with sesame seeds, well, it's just what it sounds like, and it is fantastic!The pièce de résistance was the Astako Makaronada, spaghetti with lobster (and I DO mean the claws and all!), fresh tomatoes, onions, garlic and feta. I am not a huge seafood fan, but there was something about this dish that made me put my notions about it aside and try a few bites of the lobster itself...though I largely stuck to the flavorful and perfectly-cooked pasta and left everyone else to pick at the crustacean, the bit of lobster I had was pretty good! I'm glad I tried even a little forkful. I'm glad I visited Voula NYC! It's not often I can say I've had a truly unique dining experience in NYC, believe it or not - there are so many restaurants but it's all burgers / ramen / pho / crazy milkshakes, it seems - but I ate dishes I have never even heard of, and that made my experience there truly special.",20,0.9909

The restaurant, which is showcasing what it calls the ""sustainable sushi"" experience, has one single counter helmed by a Caucasian chef Jeff Miller, who recently came onboard after working in Texas. When I showed up with my wife Jun for a Sunday evening, we were the only diners at the counter, and as much as I hate to admit it, having a non-Japanese chef was a scary proposition at first. I am very glad to be proven wrong about my trepidations, though, since Mayanoki had some of the best locally sourced fish (i.e. mostly on the East Coast) with quite unique attributes. While speaking to chef Miller during our dinner, I was very impressed with his knowledge of the fish and the way he tried to showcase an alternative vision of a sushi dinner. None of the fish on our menu (I would say a relative bargain at $95 per person for 15 courses) came from California or Japan; in fact, there was only one from Iceland (more on that later). Yet, many of the pieces that we sampled were very delicious and made me truly appreciate what the kitchen was trying to do here. After an outstanding dish of kale and quail egg, chef Miller handed us a roll with oyster and salmon roe. I don't remember ever getting an oyster at a sushi restaurant but I wasn't complaining as the combination of the two distinct species made for one heck of a bite. Shrimp that was farmed indoors nearby in New York State, unlike the traditional ebi, had the crunchy feel to it that was quite wonderful, and bay scallops from Nantucket Bay had the silky smooth texture that is not easily forgettable. Others like swordfish from Montauk and fatty bluefish (a Rhode Island version of o toro in two different cuts) were also outstanding. The only non-U.S. fish was salmon farmed in Iceland, and Jun was raving about how the lightly smoked touch made it so much more interesting than a typical salmon nigiri we've had before. Others like albacore from Oregon, Spanish mackerel from North Carolina, herring from Rhode Islands, Boston mackerel and fluke from Long Island had varying levels of success. For the pieces that I graded at a lower level, I felt the seasoning could've been slightly toned down to give greater pleasure to the texture of the fish. Still, at the end of the night, Jun and I really enjoyed our meal while chatting about chef Miller about his background and the philosophy behind this potentially pioneering sushi restaurant.Mayanoki accepts reservations, and while we were the only diners on a chilly Sunday evening, there is only one single counter so I recommend booking in advance. There are some interesting sake and wine options that can go well with your meal that I suggest checking out. The cozy counter, combined with the friendliness of the manager and chef Miller, will make for one good date idea. I am very looking forward to seeing how Mayanoki evolves over time; its unique concept is certainly worth exploring if you are tired from all the high-end omakase places in the city and want to see a fresh set of perspectives on the art of sushi.",29,0.9984
188,17,8,4.0,"Cote is definitely pricier than your typical K-town Korean BBQ, but ultimately I felt that it was worth it. There were a few hiccups in service but overall my friends and I had an enjoyable experience, and I would definitely go back. Make sure to make reservations well in advance!The ambiance here is really nice. I really appreciated the free coat check, as it's a peeve of mine to leave KBBQ joints with my clothes reeking of it. The decor is very elegant and there is a spacious bar at the front to pass time while waiting for your table. The bartenders were really sweet and friendly, and very good at what they do. We had the Agave Sour and the Seoul-Side and both were delicious, albeit a bit small in volume for the price ($15). We had a reservation at 9 PM and were seated around 9:20.The Butcher's Feast was a no-brainer for us, since it allowed us to sample 4 different types of beef. For $45 per person, it also comes with banchan, two stews, egg souffle, a plate of lettuce for wraps, rice, and soft serve. It's my understanding that the beef types rotate based on the night, but we were served hanger steak, aged ribeye, wagyu, and short rib/galbi. We also ordered the Korean bacon as an appetizer, but I think we would have been plenty stuffed sticking just to the feast. It was delicious though - crispy slices of pork belly paired well with jalapeño and a mustard sauce.The quality of the meat is definitely apparent in every bite, both in flavor and texture. I usually like to have dipping sauces with my KBBQ, but found myself just savoring the meat as-is here. We were a little confused as to whether we were supposed to be cooking the meat ourselves or waiting for our server. Initially, it seemed like the server would be handling the cooking, but our first meat almost burned/became overcooked so we started just doing our own thing. We didn't mind cooking ourselves, but would have appreciated better communication. The ribeye was by far my favorite and the most tender, but I also loved how perfectly marinated the galbi short-rib was. We also liked how well-timed the side dishes came out. We received the stews and souffle about half-way through and it was a nice way to break up the meats. The souffle was so fluffy and I loved the mushroom tofu stew. Dessert consisted of a seasonal soft-serve, which was shaved peppermint this time around. It was SO GOOD. I'm a huge fan of soft serve and this one does not miss the mark. There was a slight situation with one of the other patrons near our table on the night that we dined, but I was impressed with how well the restaurant handled everything. They were extremely courteous and a staff member even came up to us afterwards to apologize if it had detracted from our experience in any way (it didn't, but the gesture was nice). Yes, I had a bit of sticker shock when we received the bill but again - I felt like it was worth every penny. Already thinking about my next viisit back!",20,0.9993
189,8,4,4.0,"I came with a group of 4. Everyone was held upstairs until the reservation starts and then we were brought downstairs all together.

Someone needs to pick calmer / chill music. Service here was excellent and they made all the desserts in front of you.

190,26,19,4.0,"I have legitimately been watching this place for a while. I've have been checking it out from afar and lusting after a taste of their food. I'm now going to warn you that this is about to get a little out of control, take your PG-13 warning and stop now if you can't handle the heat. Can you handle it?I sure can handle it!!! Let me clarify, this place is a plain, hole in the wall buffet that has a long seating area. In the center of the place, you will find the treasure trove of a buffet.

They give you a cup for water, a spoon, fork and knife to dig into your plate.I was filling my mouth slowly to sample all of the flavors and textures. Not all items are labeled so I welcomed the idea of using my tongue and tastebuds to explore. ((Shudders)) I stopped short of licking the styrofoam plate.

191,15,5,4.0,"Ok - after realizing that UES is more than just an ice cream shop, I can see the appeal and why the ice cream front is really just a front.So while the ice cream is just OK, come here later at night (maybe after 8?) and you'll notice a nicely dressed man who is actually a bouncer. Ask him to look at the ""storage room"" and show him your ID. Then, you need to find the ""switch"" and then wait for the door to open! It's magical and totally awesome. If you love speakeasies or hidden bars you definitely have to try this out. WAIT: We came on a Friday night at 8pm and there was only 1 table left so it was nice that we didn't have to wait. ATMOSPHERE: The ice cream shop is tiny but inside is pretty large, so it makes sense why there isn't much space. Once you walk in you're greeted with neon signs and a hostess who can check in your coat and show you to your seat. The inside is very eclectic giving it that haunted mansion/Alice in Wonderland feel with things coming out of the roof and lots of paintings/pictures on the wall. They play loud popular music and the lighting is very dim. Tea cup candles on each table, which are usually small and narrow for 2 people or they have larger booths and a bar. Very whimsical and cool, definitely not like something I've seen on the upper east side.FOOD: Their menu is an Upper East Side ""guide"" with unique names. It's a pretty extensive menu with lots of descriptions and they tell you how strong the cocktail is, the wow factor etc. and then the cost. This place kind of reminds me of a cheesier aviary because they have drinks that look cool and some that have cool quirks to them. For example, the gossip girl one has this piece of corn husk/straw/hay that they light on fire. MILLIONAIRE - I forget the exact name but we got it because it has mochi. You can make any drink a ""mocktail"" since I don't drink and my husband wasn't in the mood for alcohol. It probably didn't taste right since it didn't have the alcohol but the presentation was cool. It was a cup within a cup and on the bottom of the first larger cup were 4 ""smoked"" gumdrops that tasted like they were roasted over a wooden campfire. The top had the drink, whipped cream and a quarter of a mochi. A little stale/overfrozen but not bad. I like that most of the drinks have an ice cream or dessert/sweets theme to them and they use the soco creamery ice cream they have out front. I wish they would serve scoops of their ice cream in the bar in case you dont want a drink or you want dessert and a drink.Overall, I would say this is pretty ingenious since you would never be able to tell it's a hidden bar, very cool, very trendy and I like that it's so close to us!",25,0.9957

Their menu is on the expensive side, with entrees easily costing you a good 20 dollars or more. The decor is dainty and detailed, giving off a bookworm, chill vibe. Our tuna tataki rice bowl was refreshing and simply made, showcasing natural flavors and fresh ingredients. The tuna itself was flavorless, but married well with the sauces, crisp radish, fresh greens, and bonito flakes. The banchan, in my opinion, was the star of the meal. The softened, sweetened lotus root had a great fulfilling mouthfeel, while the deviled egg was smooth, savory, and perfectly eggy. In all, for what you pay for, you can expect delicately prepared, fresh food that can easily be shared with a friend. I'll be looking here for a dress-up brunch next time I'm in the area.",24,0.9909
193,19,11,4.0,"I've known of Eataly for quite a while but have never actually been until today. Half the reason is because I just never made a real effort, and the other half is because I've always been suspicious of its authenticity. The fact that it's a big tourist spot and its celebrity chef backing never put it on the top of my list of authentic Italian eateries in New York City. However, I've been to other Batali/Bastianich restaurants which were quite good, and since I was in the area with some friends today we decided to check it out.The best way to describe Eataly is a hybrid of various cafes, restaurants, and shops - all carrying a variety of Italian cuisine and merchandise. Walking in on a Saturday afternoon the place was loud and packed - judging from other reviews that seems to be the norm. It didn't bother me too much though, I had already eaten so I really just wanted to explore the merchandise and absorb it all. There seems to be everything one would want - in addition to the restaurants, there's stands for bread, fish, meats, and cheese. They also have a number of Italian grocery items and Eataly souvenirs. Walking through the shops they have a number of authentic Italian food items - I noticed a lot of tomato products (including Lidia Bastianich's canned sauce) as well as pastas and cookies. Like other reviewers, I noticed prices were high - I can get pretty much everything Eataly sells on Arthur Ave in the Bronx for a lower price. Eataly has piqued my interest, and it's a fun place to shop, eat and explore. I would return to pick up some quick items, and maybe sit down at one of their restaurants - but I would make an effort to come at off peak times (if they even exist). Eataly seems to deliver the goods, just be aware of the Manhattan prices.",32,0.9884

196,21,6,4.0,"My friend Pam and I got here at 6pm on a Wednesday... We were pretty much the only two people there for an entire hour, and between 7 & 730 the place filled up completely. We were expecting a restaurant with a hostess and waiters, but it's a regular ""find your own seat"" pizza place. Usually these types of places are smaller, and the tables aren't as nice or clean. But it was a very laid back and casual environment. We each had a suppli, the fried risotto croquettes stuffed with mozzarella. They were like arancini, I'm not exactly sure if there's a difference or if there's more than one name for this appetizer but either way, they were good. They weren't greasy or dry, which is usually what can make these not taste great, but the crisp was just right. Then we had our two pizzas which we shared. One was the mushroom pizza, with onions, thyme, and fontina. The other pizza was a ""my margherita"" (which is a regular Margherita with your choice of toppings), and we got the mushrooms and truffle oil. Although the two pizzas both had mushrooms, they were quite different. Equally good, and after a break I could've even split a third pizza. We had wine with dinner, and although the drink options are very limited, it actually didn't taste bad for a house wine at all. And lastly, we split the vanilla soft serve gelato, which was also good. I really want to try the pizza with Brussel sprouts, cheese, and pepper... I'll definitely go back, hopefully soon!",28,0.9803
197,23,9,4.0,"As someone who grew up on homecooked Chinese (Sichuan) cuisine, I can see why a lot of diners might shy away from Philippe. The prices are definitely higher than your typical Chinese restaurant, but neither the food nor the dining experience here is typical.I dined here with a larger group so was able to sample a number of dishes. From the appetizers, I would recommend the Chicken Satays which are super tender and served with an addictive peanut sauce. The noodles are also solid, but my preference was for the Vegetable Lo Mein, which are hand-pulled and served with fresh vegetables and cooked in an addictive sauce. The Lobster Noodles were also a seafood lover's delight, with plenty of chunks of real lobster meat.I think where the restaurant really shines is in their Peking Duck, which is carved tableside and there's elements of showmanship and skill from the chef. The skin is crisp and packed with flavor, and the meat has just enough fat to make for a delicious bite. It's served with pancakes, hoisin, and celery, so you can make yourself the perfect Peking Duck wrap. The Beijing Chicken was also a group favorite, featuring tender chicken meat in a bright red sauce.For the dessert: the Cotton Candy Baked Alaska makes for a great closing spectacle, and features a Baked Alaska hidden in a dome of cotton candy. Yes, there's fire, and yes, it's delicious.For special occasions, I'd recommend visiting Philippe for a unique dining experience and a modern take on traditional Chinese dishes.",34,0.9956

The whole thang:I have at least a decade-long issue with this area, in that - more times than not - you need to know hole-in-the-wall joints to get authentic non-American flavor, rather than the more typical ""let's season everything for the average, no-adventurous tourist palate"" approach. I'm especially particular with Brazilian cuisine, since my travels and having one of the best options for it around the corner from my apartment has informed and molded my palate.Samba = the real thing!The Pão de Queijo made me stop convo and give side eye to the bowl.The Caipirinhas were on point in all three flavors we tried, including me ordering a Cashew Fruit Juice one (technically off the menu).

200,15,7,4.0,"When I heard there was a new Russian fast food chain opening near my office I was stoked. Memories of a very early and amusing attempt at a ""Russian McDonald's"" in FiDi circa 2000 recalled decent food, low prices, and Soviet-style rude service by unhappy female workers wearing Micke D hairnets.No such poblems weigh down the streamlined Teremok, a franchise in a global chain of successful Russian-influenced blini-n-kasha cafes that is smart to localize dishes for its New York audience (see pastrami kaska bowl!).The food is relatively authentic, with the blini and kaska comprising most of the menu choices, but other staples such as pelmeni (dumplings) and kvas (fermented bread ""soda"") available at reasonable price. Other items may vary. The ""venegret,"" for instance, was nothing like the beet/ potato/pickle salad I grew up with. All the ingredients were there, but left in their individual piles rather than mixed, almost as if inviting you to DIY your own venegret. The blini, which my friend ordered, were soft and delicious, though I was just as happy to lay on a dollop of dominant sour cream flavor (it comes in large condiment squeeze packets here!).There was some order confusion (I had asked for the aforementioned pastrami kasha) but I was more than happy to hoover the ""mistake"" order of lox and kasha. That buckwheat! Took me back to all those lunches I ate growing up, the only thing missing was the required cutlet.

206,17,10,4.0,"Due West is a fantastic addition to the West Village. I was skimming Eater NY recently and stumbled upon a list of new openings. When I saw ""cocktail bar"" and ""West Village"", I was immediately pleased. Don't get me wrong--there are a number of fantastic cocktail bars in the West Village. Employees Only, Slowly Shirley, Little Branch, the Garret, Highlands--the selection could certainly be worse. But I've been to all of these bars plenty (quality problems, I know), and there hasn't been anything new in the area in quite some time. Due West offers a fabulous variety of originals, draft cocktails and bottled cocktails, as well as a pretty substantial food menu. We only came for drinks, but from what we saw during our visit here, the food alone is reason enough to return. In a nutshell: fantastic drinks, appetizing eats and some cool ambiance to top it off. We came to Due West for a pre-dinner drink, at around 8:45pm on a Saturday night. Somehow, with just 17 reviews on Yelp, this place appears to have gotten on the radar of the masses. It was snowing pretty heavily on this particular night, and we still needed to wait a bit to get in. This was partially due to the fact that the owner appears to not like folks congregating at/crowding the bar. Normally this would irritate me, but I actually appreciated it once we did get in. The space itself is decently-sized, but there's not a ton of standing room by the bar. There are far more seating options. The owner was able to seat us at a communal table soon after we ordered our drinks at the bar, so it worked out well. The vibe here is more chic than the average West Village hangout. Though less homey/cozy than a lot of the other popular bars in the area, it's still warm and friendly. Servers are super accommodating, bartenders are knowledgable and prompt, and not surprisingly, the clientele skews higher-brow finance-y (as opposed to, like, the 13th Step kind of finance-y). The drink menu at Due West, as I mentioned, is impressively varied. You've got your typical shaken and stirred originals, along with draft and bottled cocktails. If none of those suit your fancy, there's also a Create Your Own Old Fashioned, which looks unbelievable. You have your pick of whiskey, bitters and sugar. Can you imagine Maple sugar and Orchard bitters? Fabulous idea, surprising more cocktail bars don't offer this. For once, I was sad that the restaurant we were waiting on summoned us early, because I only got to try one drink here. It was not an Old Fashioned, but it was still seriously great. I got the Green Witch (Greenhook Gin, Absinthe, Pamplemousse, Saffron, Toasted Rosemary), which is one of the cocktails on tap here. Really interesting, complex, great flavors, well-balanced, nothing too overpowering, refreshing yet substantial. A great drink to kick off a night. The bf got the DW Sour (Fords Gin, Tangerine, Tamarind, Lemon, Egg White), which was frothy, elegant and citrusy. Two great drinks, and I'm sure we'll be back for more soon.",25,0.9974

The food comes out pretty quick too. My friend built her own omelette. By the time we were finished we couldn't move. Would definitely come back for breakfast. Wasn't pricy either.

210,20,12,4.0,"As I passed by this bakery, I noticed a line....why is there a line for this bakery? It was early 7:50am and there were about 5 people in line already, I might as well give it a shot.After the place opened it's doors at 8:05am, the customers walked down the long table where the bakery showcased what they had and the labels on the bottom described what the goods were and the price.I pretty much ordered everything except from the Cruffin; which was what they were known for.Got a box and paid the bill.The most expensive croissant was the peach and the banana split, topping out at $8 each.Everything tasted awesome, my favorite pick would be the squid ink donuts and pistachio croissant. The cream filling in them weren't too sweet and it balanced just right. You can skip the $8 items, the banana split and the peach croissant was just too overly sweet and just looks pretty with the few gold flakes on top.The box they give you is very shiny and makes a great background for those photo ops.",26,0.9407
211,42,27,4.0,"Tucked away in East Village, Ho Foods is a cleverly named (after its owner) Taiwanese noodle shop that specializes in Taiwanese beef noodle soup. I recently dined here on a soft opening night and it was a pleasant experience. From the cozy atmosphere to minimal and clean décor, the intimate seating arrangement to old black-and-white family photographs, I felt like I was dining in my grandmother's house, although I do not have a Taiwanese grandmother lol.Currently, the shop offers one entrée item: Taiwanese beef noodle soup. Served with a bone and marrow broth that is carefully simmered for 24 hours, it is a solid dish and I had no complaints about it. The broth, the owner's family recipe, is delicately balanced and absolutely satisfying: Spicy, fragrant, and hearty - perfect for a cold winter night. You can opt to slurp this delicious broth with either thick noodles or wide noodles, which are from local purveyors. I personally preferred the wide noodles because I enjoyed the amount of grease and broth it picked up in each bite (yes, I'm all about those surface areas). However, I really liked the texture of the thick noodles, as it had a little more bite. The beef was cooked to perfection - the fat beautifully rendered and very tender in texture. The pickled mustard greens is absolutely delicious and adds a lot to the beef noodle soup.Because the restaurant is quite small, I wouldn't recommend dining here with a large group. But it is an ideal place to grab a quick bite by yourself or with a small party. As Ho Foods recently opened, I am positive that they are in the process of figuring out what works and what doesn't, as well as what kinds of other dishes they can add to their menu. As their business grows, it would be interesting to see if they venture to make their own noodles. Either way, I can't wait to come and check this restaurant in a few weeks and see how they are continuing to evolve.",43,0.9938
212,17,8,4.0,"When it comes to contemporary Middle Eastern fare, look no further than Nur. They offer some fantastic bites and especially some wonderful entrees to share. Highly recommend to bring a friend or friends to get in on as many of the dishes here. I was thoroughly impressed by the originality and uniqueness of the food, or perhaps a lot of these dishes have just been unbeknownst to me. Either way, Nur was worth the trip.My friend and I came when Nur was fairly new, having been opened for only a month (opened earlier in 2017). Even so, service was running smoothly and the restaurant was pleasantly packed. Reservations were quite tight at the time, and I can only imagine they still are. We had many dishes in mind to try, but we decided to try four dishes on our first visit. Portions are quite substantial, and so pricing seems fair. Our dinner included the Horias (Crispy pita filled with spiced lamb), the Smoked Eggplant Carpaccio (fire roasted eggplant with feta, raw tahini, dates, pistachios, rose water), the Casablanca Chraime (poached fish stew with tomato, mussels, and hand-rolled couscous with pumpkin tershi), and the Kubaneh (a special Yemenite pull apart bread with schug and grated tomato). I highly recommend any and all the breads available. The Kubaneh was delicious, maintaining a fine soft interior texture. Schug happens to be also one of my favorite Middle Eastern condiments (hot green chilies). The Kubaneh reminded me a bit of challah. As for the Eggplant Carpaccio, it is quite similar to hummus or baba ganoush in flavor and texture, but the pistachio really adds to it. I really enjoyed this with our Kubaneh. Our starter dish, the Horias, was quite tasty. They are basically mini lamb pita sandwiches. The Chraime was good and while I remember enjoying it, it was still probably the least memorable. I would definitely go for the Kubaneh and Eggplant Carpaccio next visit but opt for something over the Chraime and possibly the Horias. Nur was wonderful the first time, and my mouth only waters as I write about the Kubaneh. Their breads are definitely the thing to get and make sure to dive into that side of Schug. I loved the Eggplant Carpaccio as a pairing to the bread as well. For a new restaurant, service was steady. The restaurant space is clean and modern, though some may think the lighting is too dark at the very back of the restaurant (which made taking food photos a bit tricky). Nonetheless, I am a a fan and highly recommend Nur if you like Middle Eastern food but with a bit of added flair.",24,0.9975

Wow giant slice of pizza that unless u r starving is good for sharing.On the slice Artichoke hearts with some spinach topped with cream cheese, mozzarella & pecorino cheese all finalize this delicious slice I gotta say it was very good nice thin crispy crust just adds to the cheesy goodness that is the slice very flavorful.

I kept seeing Milk & Cream on Yelp so I figured we try it out. The space is very open and bright with a bunch of bar stools, so you can see the ice cream being made, which was cool.As I was looking at the menu, I thought it was kind of pricey, so I figured that my friend and I share, but we didn't want the same thing, so we decided to get our own. The guy at the register was super nice and friendly and just seemed like a cool ass guy.When we got our ice cream, I was taken aback by how GINORMOUS the ice cream was. I definitely understood the price tag after seeing the portion sizes. I told myself that there was NO WAY I can eat the whole thing, but....... of course, I ate the whole damn thing, without any regrets either.

218,6,3,4.0,"KenScale: 8.5/10I've been to every restaurant opened by the super-duo of Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone and loved every one of them. Starting from humble beginning at Torrisi Italian Specialties (which recently shut down temporarily to elevate its already-outstanding tasting menu to another level), they've been on an expansion mode for a while now. Santina is the latest project from this duo, this time a coastal Italian restaurant below the High Line inspired by chef Carbone's grandmother from Sicily. This is another winner from the growing Torrisi-Carbone empire. I've always been a fan of intensity and boldness of food served at Torrisi-Carbone restaurants, from the retro Italian-American temple of Carbone to the twist on French cuisine at Dirty French. If you walked into Santina not knowing who opened this restaurant, you wouldn't imagine in your dream this is a place from Torrisi-Carbone duo. Everything is so lightened compared to the incumbent restaurants, from the bright dining room to the music that makes you feel like you're sitting at a café somewhere on the Caribbean to the airy feel to all the dishes that I tried. Every meal at Santina must start with cecina (chickpea-flour pancakes) that you can wrap different food of your choosing (my recommendation is to go with lamb tartare) and house made spicy sauce. I proceeded to try two pastas, and this is where the restaurant truly shined. Both chitarra santina (which came in a pretty unique combination of lamb and seafood) and spaghetti blue crab don't have the rustic touch that you would expect at other outstanding pasta restaurants, but they were exceptional with the way pasta noodles were cooked and the cleanness to flavor without overpowering your palate. In particular, my dining companion couldn't stop raving about the spaghetti blue crab, and I agree it is one of the best pasta dishes I've had this year so far. Santina is more focused on seafood and vegetables than meat, so for the main dishes, I sampled two fish dishes. Swordfish tasted a little bit like pork chop in texture (which is by no means a bad thing), but the seasoning could've been lightened a little bit. On the other hand, bass was truly outstanding, working beautifully with peppers and tangerines for an airy dish that you would love to have on the Mediterranean coast. For dessert, chocolate diplomatic was a nice finish to the meal, with salted chocolate that wasn't overly sweet to my liking.I really loved the bright décor and lively ambiance of the restaurant. It would probably be the lightest and most fun among the restaurants in the Torrisi-Carbone portfolio. The restaurant has a full bar with some fun cocktail menus that all look tropical in appearance. Getting a reservation, as with any hot spot from Torrisi-Carbone team, would be quite difficult to make sure to book way in advance or try your luck at the bar. It's been a brutal winter in New York, and Santina would offer an welcome sanctuary where you can explore the ethereal touch of coastal Italian cuisine.",12,0.9976
219,18,4,4.0,"Lovely little place we stumbled on after my boyfriend got his haircut near by in China town! We were surprised to find this little tofu place in the out of no where!! But we are so happy we came! The restaurant is much larger on the inside once you walk in. It's very cute with a garden theme. Lots of interesting things to look at. The menu is very similar to BCD tofu with your tofu soups, BBQ, bibimbap, and combos. I love how it's used as your table mat since I like to read the menu while waiting sometimes. We ended up ordering a bugolgi + tofu soup comboand regular size tofu soup. Then on came the yummy banchans! All of the food and banchan were yummy and it was really nice that it came with a steamed egg! We also received a side of regular tofu as well too. What I did notice was that all of the items here were not as salty and heavy compared so many of the other Korean Restaurants I've been to (which is a good thing!!) that makes me feel like I could definitely come here more often!The service was also wonderful. They are attentive, kind, and you can tell they are passionate about their restaurant.Overall we concluded that we would definitely come back to Tofu tofu when we are craving Korean food home style and just want to unwind. Yummy and not too heavy! Also cheaper than ktown!",18,0.9956

We got the banana toasted (they blowtorch it) and my little niece knew it was banana flavored instantly. They do a good job of really flavoring the marshmallows with unique flavors and they have a nice soft texture. I honestly with full disclosure didn't taste a single one but they felt soft and came with instructions on how to preserve the marshmallow soft texture. I'm assuming it was good given the flavor variety and how quickly my niece gobbled up the roasted one. It's a cute spot offering something different.

They only recently added matcha to their menu, but prior and still, they dole out some tasty treats and beverages. Their matcha lattes are rich and creamy, and their lychee matcha iced tea is perfectly fruity. I am not a coffee drinker, but I've sampled their Cozy Mint Coffee, an icy-cool mint-infused cuppa, and it is rather refreshing! They bring in Bibble & Sip cream puffs; go for the matcha!

Whenever I have friends over from out of town, I always take them on a food tour of NYC (you gotta admit... we have some of the BEST food in the world and the variety here is astounding!). One of the places I like to take my friends is BaoHaus. It's great for a quick bite to refuel and keep the tour goingFirst impressions: after coming here multiple times... you'd think I'd get used to the crazy crowds and small cramped location... nope... there's almost always a long line, no seating available and I can't wait to get some noms. The TV is playing a loop of the Vice interview of BaoHaus and owner Eddie Haung (from Fresh Off the Boat!) and there's graffitti and stickers everywhere from past patronsMy favorite things to get: The Birdhaus Bao (or get it spicy as the Fire Birdhaus) - crispy fried chicken with the perfect amount of seasoning and the crispy crunch to meat ratio is perfection. The Fried Fish Bao- fried fish filet with cabbage, tarter sauce and sprinkled with peanuts. I feel like this one is the least ordered bao (compared to the pork belly)... even when I recommend it to my friends... but the ones who are smart enough to order it, all love it. Taro Fries- everyone has heard of french fries (potato) or sweet potato fries... even yucca fries (shout out to Pio Pio!) but not many people have heard of or have tried taro fries and that's a DAMN SHAME! These carby, crunchy, seasoned fries are delicious. They are a bit denser than regular potato fries but they have that same satisfying crunch. I could eat these by the pound. I highly recommend coming here earlier in the day because they do run out (it's happened to me twice!) and it's awful to hear that they've run out! Don't be that guy! I've also tried their Sweet Bao Fries (both the black sesame and the pandan, which is my personal favorite) and I love the fried, doughy sweetness that is a great end to the meal without being too overwhelmingly sweet. The hype is real, the food is good. I wish the prices were just a smidge less... you can eat a bao in 2-3 bites (kind of like a slider) and to pay $4-5 per bao becomes pretty steep... all the small bites are delicious but you have to order several things off the menu to get full. One or two baos are fine (~$10) but any more and the meal becomes pricier.",23,0.9977
226,15,11,4.0,"I thought I had already written a review on this place so let me get right to it. If you are in the area and you are craving a salad this place is the BOMB DIGGITY!!! You can pick from up to 5 different types of greens, add whatever toppings and protein that you want or you can just be basic and order a specific salad from the menu. I like to mix things up a bit. They also have other foods other than salad. I have tried the Acai breakfast bowl. It was AWESSOMEEE! The service is really good and they have a rewards card that you can get punched every time you order. If you are like me and you like to get a lot of different toppings you can easily end up paying close to $20 for a salad but hey, it is what it is. My only beef with this place is that the salad isn't organic and for the price point, I've been to other salad bars that offer organic salads and are about the same price and parking sucks but other than that its a great place.

If you say no, I kid you not they just keep adding more. I got the regular poke bowl with brown rice. With a scoop of tuna and salmon. The sauce I got was the regular shoyu and the sweet unagi sauce. As for the sides I love the mango and seaweed salad. The scallions also add a nice taste. For me, the regular fills me up pretty good already, $12 was really worth it!

228,23,12,4.0,"Wagamama. Oh you had me at Flat iron. Let's do this place justice for a second. As you approach from the corner of the block, you immediately notice that this place has a striking presence that draws you in. You want to walk through the glass doors and find what those floor to ceiling panes are holding within.Upon entry you encounter the bar on your left and it is an impressive open concept view to the rear. The host approaches and escorts you to your spot. Luckily, as I was painfully early, I got to strut down a very cozy pseudo-catwalk. It's almost like you are surrounded by the fury of a busy open kitchen but carry your inner peace. We were in the mezzanine. Upstairs and away from the bathrooms. I walked to the corner seat, closest to the windows and watched as the others filed in. They oohed and awwed the two signature drinks. But I knew once the bartender said Whiskey, with home brewed tea that I'd found the one for me. Their Mai Tai was flirty and fun but not the type that would hold me for the night. So as I sipped my tea, I was immersed in art chat and edu-scientific speak with a fantastic crew who lightly provoked my inner wild child.I tried my best to refrain but the beast was out of the bag later on.

229,15,8,4.0,"Came here for my birthday celebration with friends and it was exactly what I was looking for.RESERVATIONS: I called to make a large group reservation about a month in a advance. If you have more than 10 people (so 11+) you have to do a pre-fixe menu of about $88/person. Since I didn't want to do that, I opted for a group of 10. When I arrived, my husband and I were the first to get there so they said to let them know when the majority of our group was there and they'll seat us.ATMOSPHERE: I loved ABC Kitchen's vibe and this one looked even more awesome. It has lots of white everywhere and feels very modern and trendy. There are obscure/modern looking light fixtures and artwork. One side has a bar/open kitchen and then the other dining area has a slightly open kitchen and more tables. Each tables is adorned with various plants and succulents, candles and low lighting. Perfect for the birthday celebration I was planning.FOOD: It's a vegetarian restaurant, which I was skeptical about at first but like most people have said, despite that, their food is very flavorful. I think with a smaller group, most of the dishes are meant to be shared but because we had so many people it just made more sense to order 1-2 appetizers and then each person order their own dish. Don't expect to be very full coming out of here.SPAGHETTI - very chewy green spinach noodles with lots of lemon/zest. It is a big on the tart side so beware of that but it was perfect for my dinner portion. CAULIFLOWER - a whole cauliflower was enough for 10 of us and is a great sight to see with the knife stuck in it. Pour all of the sauce because it is delicious. It has a curried cauliflower type taste, almost reminiscent of some Indian side dishes. Highly recommend and makes for a great photo.HUMMUS - people raved about this so I asked for it with both the crudite and pita. A pita has 4 triangles so we got 2 (which they charged extra for). It's good with the hummus, which has a slight thai basil taste and is just very flavorful. If you enjoy hummus, I would get this and skip the crudite.*CAKE CUTTING FEE - they charged $7/person because we brought our own cake and they helped us cut it. I did appreciate that they lit the candles AND put it on this classic white cake stand.Overall, I enjoyed my birthday celebration here and would recommend it for a nice date night or birthday or celebration dinner. It IS quite pricey for what you are getting (small, simple portions) but I gave it 4 stars because of the entire package (food + atmosphere).",18,0.9928

There was also a big weird painting of a Japanese girl taking a selfie surrounded by textbooks and a cartoon girl face behind her. The waitress was oddly both super aggressive and hateful right out of the gate.I got sat at the bar and she sort of scolded me to quickly scoot my chair up.  When I got up awkwardly, she moved the chair all the way against the base board so I had to squeeze in. On the menu, almost all of the ramens said ""soy sauced based"".When she came back to take my order, in a rush, I asked her if there were any pork broth ramens. She impatiently nodded and urged me to order.  I asked for more time. I then waited about 8 minutes, and she came back with attitude. I asked if the natura ramen was pork based, because on the menu it said ""soy sauced based"". I was holding the menu close since I can't see very well.  She sort of rolled her eyes and said that all the ramens were pork based and started pointing at the menu. ""Get your hands out of my face !""I said and moved the menu out of the way, where it fell onto the counter with a thud. Everything kind of stopped. ""Well that's what I want."" I said.Menus were removed. Damn it was like she was my angry x girlfriend in a past life. About 8 minutes later, a different young woman approached and asked me if I wanted to order.I said I already ordered.""No you didn't order."" She kind of looked at me like I was an idiot. My angry x girlfriend in a past life's side kick.""I did order, but if you give me the menu, I'll show you what I want."" I was gonna tough this out. I was just praying the banshee chick didn't accost me again in the name of rushed hysterical service, or that I wouldn't be taunted by a staff who could care less.Ramen for $11 was a good deal in New York, and the kitchen smelled good.  I really wanted to order many things on the menu. The fried rice and the pork buns were both $5, so were octopus balls.Ramen arrived, delivered by the cook, whose energy was much more tranquil. The broth was so good. Wether it was soy based or pork based who knows, but I think I tasted both. The protein was big chunks, luscious, just a little fatty.  You have your choice of pork, chicken or beef. At first I assumed it was going to be pork, but it tasted more like pot roast. It was so satisfying after a tiring busy week.  Luckily I was left at peace as we moved on.  Every time I needed a water refill I had to move my cup to emphasize its nature.  There was only one other table and my water cup just sat there empty as they giggled to each other. It was annoying, but the food was so good. I got the octopus balls to go for dessert.  I had most of the noodles left over and I asked for them to go as well. Our interaction was much more gracious this time. (With the sidekick, the first one remained appropriately invisible.) The sidekick paused with large eyes that almost looked humorous as she started to say that all to go orders that began as sit down must pay .50 per container. OCD heaven.She got a lot nicer when the check came. I was wondering if she was even going to bring back the change but she did. She even suddenly refilled my water.I checked the octopus balls right before I left to make sure they had no mayo as ordered.  They had mayo. I left the box open on the counter and she eventually walked by and said she would remake them. No apology. No kick in the a$$. Just the feel of being slighted. Summary A young immature staff clouded a very delicious meal.The ramen was great, different from most with the broth and the protein, so delicious. Omg so good. The octopus balls had full tentacles inside, and they were a little crunchy but the dough was tasty and pillowy, as described.Good value if you can handle some abuse.I'll go back - prepared to battle.",17,0.9973
232,15,9,4.0,"I've been to quite a number of sushi places, but Sushi Mike's always stood out as a place I wanted to try. I'm not sure why - maybe because it's located in Dobb's Ferry (which has a number of excellent restaurants), or maybe it's because a number of my Yelp friends gave it good reviews, or maybe because I just like sushi. Whatever the reason, I wanted to try. Tonight my friend and I were feeling it so we decided to make our way to Dobb's Ferry to check this place out.Like most other sushi restaurants I've been to, SM's isn't large. Upon entry there's a small seating area where the sushi bar is and then more seating some steps down. We were warmly greeted by a gentleman (was that you Mike?) which I thought was really nice. The decor doesn't really flow throughout the space; for me, the upper seating area gives off one aura while the bottom gives off another. There are some nice paintings on the walls and music playing which adds to the atmosphere (the restaurant also smelled amazing). The menu is large, they have a nice variety of soups, mains, basic rolls, speciality rolls, and combos; it was one of the more extensive sushi menus I've seen - I was impressed. Since it was cold out I wanted some soup. I got the dumpling soup which had three pork dumplings and mushrooms in a tasty broth. The soup hit the spot; the flavors worked with just the right amount of dumplings - it was presented nicely as well. For my main I got two rolls - the spicy shrimp roll and the out-of-control roll. Both rolls were very good and tasted super fresh - the out of control roll had spicy tuna and avocado topped with eel and the spicy shrimp roll had just the right amount of heat. Service was very good; it was fast, friendly, and they were on top of it. Overall I'm a fan of Sushi Mike's and glad I tried it - definitely one of the better sushi places I've been to in Westchester. I would definitely return!",16,0.9984
233,14,3,4.0,"This place would definitely better as somewhere to sit down and order as opposed to takeout. Everything I got from here was good, but because the delivery takes a while to get to where I am, I wouldn't recommend ordering if you don't live very close by. Having said that, I'd still like to try as many sandwiches on the menu as possible, including ordering in. Because they really are good sandwiches. Since their menu is different than the other options I have here in the financial district, I don't mind the wait that much. But I definitely want to stop in and order from them when I'm there. So far their cheeseburger sandwich was my favorite.",20,0.937
234,15,11,4.0,"There's a reason why Cafe China is the only Chinese place with a Michelin star, and after two years of Seamlessing their food to my office and two dine in visits I've never swayed from my opinion. Their take on Szechuan cuisine is delicious and well thought out, and I've enjoyed every dish I've had there. The most recent visit was on a Thursday night with a group of four, and the wait times are quite long, so I'd advise coming before you're actually hungry. We were given an estimate of 1.5 - 2 hours wait, but happily it ended up being more of an hour fifteen. Though their Seamless is quick, you definitely want to experience the food fresh out of the kitchen from time to time - our food arrived frighteningly fast after we gave the order to our waiter. I recommend the cold noodles, soup dumplings, and dan dan noodles to start. The jellyfish with pesto is interesting and more heavily flavored than what I'm used to, and I've only had it from takeout, but could be worth a try. For main dishes, you absolutely have to get their three pepper chicken. The heat is unbeatable and the flavor phenomenal. Their double cooked pork and vegetables are other tasty staples to keep in mind, and I really enjoyed their kung fu shrimp as well (my general favorite at Chinese places). It's definitely pricier than some of the other Szechuan and more authentic options around the area, but service is at least included in the price. The lunch specials on weekdays also seem like a steal, but I've yet to partake. Overall, I'm game to come back and dine in, but the heavy crowds and long waits reduce the experience to a Seamless-only one for me. I'd still recommend Cafe China to anyone who's never tried it - the standout food deserves your wait time.",22,0.983
235,15,7,4.0,"I stumbled upon this gem by accident when strolling around in little Italy before dinner with friends. This is a very cute small place. The place was still empty when I got there around 4:30 but quickly filled up. Rebecca was the bartender there that day and she was great. She nicely explained to me the different cocktail options on the menu and I tried the classic negroni and negroni bianco and they were both delicious. My glass was never empty as well. As soon as my water runs low she would come and fill it and when my drink was almost done, she quickly offered another. She was just the bartender that you need. The drinks were very reasonably priced and strong as well Overall we had a great experience here and left happy and tipsy. would love to come back and try the food here",22,0.9872
236,58,42,4.0,"The great thing about working in Chelsea is all the yummy baked goodies around! Decided to check out BBB after work one day and wanted something yummy to nosh on. Decided not to get a scrumptious looking arepa and opted for two cupcakes ($3.75/ea)-- chocolate cupcake w/ chocolate frosting and a peanut butter one for The Husband. My chocolate cupcake was solid. Nothing spectacular but it hit the sweet spot. The taste kind of reminded me a bit of the BK Blackout from a famed UES bakery. Just a smidge. I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter...anymore. Something to do with gorging too much on it one day when I made a peanut butter sesame oil salad dressing that has since scarred me for life. I'll eat it in small quantities but it has now made it to the top of my Gag Reflex List (applesauce, really mushy eggplant, and White Russians are also on that list, for those that are curious). Anyhow I didn't like the PB topping but oh, something in their cupcake had me like whoa, maybe I don't have a PB aversion anymore. It was almost like a subtle peanut butter cornbread muffin. Just reminded me, must try that in a recipe one day. Small seating area in the back. Nice selection for a small store. Received great service. Goods were yummy. Looking forward to trying their guava cheese pastry and the cheese arepa next",58,0.9436
237,15,12,4.0,"Really really good food. There's a lot of adjectives I could use to describe how great the food tastes.I came here with a friend, walked right in with no reservation and they were able to seat us within 15 minutes. The interior design of this place is phenomenal.Let's get to the good part. I got the Fried Chicken and my friend got Fresh Penne Pasta. The chicken was very flavorful, the amount of breading was the perfect amount, with a tangy taste to complement the fried chicken. You literally fulfill all sorts of flavors on your tastebuds.The dessert was definitely the best part in my opinion. I got the Mango Tarte Tatin and my friend got the Deep Dish Chocolate Cream Pie. The mango tarte was spectacular that I would want to order another one. The price was what prevented me from ordering another one.For the price that you are paying, the food better be good and that did not disappoint. You are paying for a brand name, it's a Bobbly Flay restaurant, in which you are paying for everything, from the presentation of the food, quality service, and quality food. You want a bottle of wine?There's a server that will pour the glass for you. Any crumbs left on the table after consuming your entree, it's all cleaned up. I would not recommend you coming here if you're in a rush because it seems like everything is timed out on purpose; from being seated, glass being poured out, dessert menu, and getting the check that will make a nice dent in your bank account.P.S. I hear this place is closing down because it was too expensive to renew their lease for the space they're in so dine here for the experience before it's gone. Or for some of you you're saying good riddance!!!",22,0.9943
238,14,8,4.0,"Lotus Blue is a new Chinese restaurant in Union Square on 15th street serving generally Southern Chinese cuisine. Tucked inside the old Pizza Vinoteca location, the interior is narrow and long, then has a pleasant sky-light covered terrace area which is out of sight from the lower level. The ambiance and decor are best described as ""Classy-Chinese"", with framed pictures, gold carpet, glass chandeliers, and modern fixtures. Due to a soft opening, the place was nearly empty when we arrived early on a Wednesday afternoon, thus we were treated to tons of attention from the waitstaff and bartender.Food was pretty tasty, typical of what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant of this caliber. We started with some Soy-Braised beef, a cold dish of sliced, flavorful beef along with a delectable sweet dipping sauce. We then shared an entree and some veggies between two of us. The Cumin Lamb had nice flavor, and was still very moist as opposed to dry-like-the-sun, something other places tend to mess up on. The plate was on the smallish side, but still would be enough for one person. It included small lamb squares, sauteed onions, fresh cilantro, and spices, along with a nice heaping of Chinese dried red peppers to add some spice. We also got a plate of what they called ""Sauteed Snap Beans"" which were your standard Chinese-style green beans cooked with garlic. Each plate came with a small bowl of rice.We were not disappointed by the food, decor, or service. If they don't change anything about these before they fully launch, it could be a success story in a previously doomed location. My only complaint is that the value was a little low. Each entree was less than $20 so it wasn't THAT pricey, but the smaller plate sizes combined with a couple extra bucks per dish added up. I understand why though, the rent needs to be paid in that next-to-Union-Square location, but it's not the kind of place we could afford to go to over and over again due to that lack of value.",25,0.9487
239,18,14,4.0,"Umm, I know, I know, it's pretty much a sin for a burger place not to serve fries with their burgers, but trust me on this when I say that y'all should forgive Ummburger for their sins because their burgers are pretty damn good on their own. And I mean, it's not like you don't get anything at all with your burger--you do get a pickle, some chips + pickled cabbage on the side. At $14 for their standard Ummburger, I think it's pretty fair, considering there are many, many other burger places in the city with burgers (and fries) that are way worse AND way more expensive. Personally, I really did enjoy my Ummburger in all its cheesy, caramelized onion-y goodness, as evidenced by just how quickly I swallowed/inhaled/devoured the whole thing. It was cooked to medium-rare juicy, flavorful perfection and I loved every bite. My only regret? I unfortunately didn't get a chance to take advantage of the happy hour this time around, but I'll definitely make sure to do so the next time I get a burger craving.",25,0.9873
240,17,10,4.0,"When I first stumbled upon the Spaniard, I wrote it off as some run-of-the-mill bar on West 4th. This small strip on West 4th that separates the West Village and Greenwich Village has always been--at least since I've been in the city--an odd blend off-brand kitschy stores, college-y bars and yes, a Gristedes. This is not to say that I'm averse to this area--I just wouldn't expect a refined bar with seriously impressive eats to reside here. Though I already had seen the good reviews (hence why I chose to come here), I was still pleasantly surprised at how fantastic the food was here. Diverse menu, everything well-executed. Through in a nice cocktail menu and solid whiskey selection and you've got yourself a top-notch establishment.Made a pre-movie reservation at 6:45 on a Friday night. The place was pretty busy--a nice mix of folks coming specifically for food and those hanging around the bar. The layout here is a bit odd. There's a somewhat separate back room that's reserved for sit-down dinners, but it's fairly small and seems incongruous here. Occasionally, I felt like they forgot about us back here, but had we not been pressed for time, I likely wouldn't have thought anything of the service. We asked them to course out our plates, and they did. So that's that. I'm sad to say that I'm off both gluten and added sugar right now, meaning beer and cocktails are prohibited. Two of my three alcohol forms of choice! It's a hard life. But I'm grateful that the Spaniard is whiskey bar, because whiskey happens to the third form in that trio. And the selection is decent here. I went with the Woodford Reserve Double Oaked for my bourbon, and a Widow Jane rye. I had never tried that Woodford Reserve before, so it was a nice treat.For food, the Spaniard has a nice array of both small and entree-sized plates. The small plates are easily shareable so if that's where your head's at, go for those. The larger dishes are all sandwiches except for one (the trout, which we ordered), so if you're craving an upscale bar sandwich, let your eyes wander over to that side of the menu. Honestly, seems hard to go wrong here. Our eats, below: Lobster toast w/crème fraîche, tarragon, corn, filone: AElegant but super flavorful. A well-balanced bite. Nice texture, loved the addition of the corn. If you're gluten-free like me, it's completely appropriate to just eat this straight off the toast. I think the picture is reason enough to order this. We shared everything and though this toast is cut into two halves, one will not feel like enough.Oysters Rockefeller w/ spinach, bacon, parmesan: AWow. These were special. This felt like spinach artichoke dip meets shellfish meets potato skins meets some entirely new kind of appetizer. Some people might not be a fan because the oyster taste isn't too detectable, but the rest of the flavors were powerful and just plain addicting. Kind of silly serving the oysters of ice given that this is a warm dish, but that's a minor criticismSteak tartare w/ dijon, shallots, brown bread crackers: A-Not amazing but still very good. Seasoned well, pretty typical preparation and presentation (mustard, shallots, etc.). The crackers served on the side added some nice texture to each bite. Chopped broccoli salad w/ napa cabbage, pecans, sherry vinaigrette: AI loved broccoli salad, so when I saw this on the menu it was an obvious pick. Wonderful blend of flavors and textures. Healthy but still had some heartiness thanks to the nuts and crumbled cheese. Adding nuts to salad is usually a well-intentioned idea, because when done well, it's next-level. Seared trout w/ frisée, pumpernickel, almonds, brown butter: A-/AA light, refined entree. The rest of the bigs are sandwiches / carb-heavy, so I was happy to see this on the menu. The bf liked the pumpernickel croutons--I unfortunately could not partake in the consumption experience of those. Trout was cooked nicely and the almonds/frisée added some nice texture and kept the dish light. Surprisingly well-done for a place that presents more as a bar than anything else.",27,0.9988
241,62,45,4.0,"Really great. After hearing about some great experiences at Atoboy, I finally got a chance recently to try their 3-course menu. You're obviously allowed to order extra, as well as the roaming trays with their specials.The space is pretty austere, almost like you're eating inside a garage. That's not a bad thing, because you can easily just focus on the beautiful plating and well-garnished dishes. Definitely a more casual joint, the dishes are anything but. Favorites:- Corn with taleggio cheese, bacon, doenjang: likely the favorite dish of the night. The richness and creaminess of the cheese and corn mixed together well with the sourness of the doenjang. So dang good.- Beef tartare with nettle, potato and watercress: The beef is nicely cut, and fatty enough to provide some richness to the dish.- Littleneck clams with avocado crème: The balance of the spiciness from the clams and the cooling effect of the avocado crème was great, and the rice crackers provided a good amount of crunch- Pork jowl, barley, ssamjang, and Cipollini onion: I always enjoy pork jowl, as it provides the fattiness and chewiness of a pork belly, but not so fatty that that you feel like you're only eating grease. Definitely well-executed and something I would order again.Service was very attentive throughout the meal, although the only thing that was confusing was that we didn't know who our server actually was, since there were so many roaming around to take our requests and orders. Prices are extremely reasonable at about $35 for the three courses, and if you're sharing, you can try a bunch of different plates.In all, very glad I finally got to try this, and will definitely be back to try their other small plates. Great place for a casual date, or a small group dinner so you can share all the different dishes.",72,0.9974

Told the waitress one of the oysters was bad and she asked which one. Later she came back with two to make up for it. Awesome service.Lobster rolls are fairly large with a large heaping pile of fries. Tasted pretty good and buttery.

Our service was excellent. If our card was green, then it took no more than seconds for one of many waiters to offer an array of meats. The selection included many cuts of beef, pork, lamb, chicken, turkey, and even seafood. My favorites were the top sirloin, filet wrapped in bacon, rib eye, and lamb chops. I was pleased with the quality of all served items. It should be noted that I did not have any seafood during my visit. There's also a salad bar and dessert cart, but I stuck with meat.After approximately 85 minutes of giving the green light, I had to turn my card red and call it quits.

The line wasn't very long and they had a separate window for ice cream orders so the pick-up was painless and nothing like the experience one might have had at their SoHo location. There are only two choices of flavors on the menu but let me warn ya, it can be hard to choose because one's Burrata and the other one's Cold Brew. So bring a friend! and give yourself the option of ordering both and sharing :PMy friend and I ordered each flavor and shared. In summary - they were both really good but we thought the Burrata was slightly better. The Burrata was not rich and thick like I had imagined considering its base is cheese. It was rather refreshing and subtly sweet. A hint of balsamic and baby basil leaves worked beautifully as garnish but more importantly brought out the right flavors and completed the ice cream perfectly. I thought the soft serves deserved the recognition as one of Dominique Ansel's many brilliant creations.",24,0.994

They even told us it was better we came early because the restaurant had a huge party coming in the same time as our reservation. It's a very small place, so it would've been chaotic. The restaurant itself is very cute, and the service is good too. I recommend ordering a bunch of plates to share.

246,16,8,4.0,"This is perhaps the quintessential definition of a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. You wouldn't be able to tell that this obscure, non-descript building housed a phenomenal restaurant serving up some authentic Mexican fair. I have my favorite Mexican eatery in Jersey, but I have to admit I have found my second one in Westchester County. Walking in for lunch one day, I could tell right away that I was in the right place if I was looking for some bold, Mexican flavors. It is undoubtedly family-run and it seems that the clientele that come are an extended part of that family. This place is a no-frills café where people from around the area grab a quick delicious bite. I decided to go with their asada and lomo tostada. The asada had the right amount of flavor and kick with a clear, distinct poblano taste. The lomo was sourer than I expected--but not in a bad way--which complemented the umami flavor of the dish. Both tostadas were topped with a generous helping of avocado and lettuce. At the end of the meal I was happy and more than satisfied with what I was served. I wouldn't have a problem stopping every day and grabbing a bite from this humble place. Restaurant Tecalitlan does small mom-and-pops establishment proud. Their commitment to authentic flavor--making someone feel as if they are eating something their family would cook for them--is something that I highly appreciate.

Do not just expect slices of fish with properly seasoned sushi rice touched with a hint of soy sauce (if necessary), wasabi, or salt. What you will receive, for example, is fish roe, Uni and oyster all together in addition to various other combinations. Furthermore, the place is very blow torch friendly. Try to sample their other creations offered with additional cost. However, keep in mind the cost. The $58 30 minute experience may easily turn into a $120 45 minute meal. A great place to sample some modern sushi techniques that may upset traditional enthusiasts. However, the new style and format is enticing.",28,0.9389

The process is similar to Cold Stone Creamery, where they mix in you stuff on a cold stone and mush them nicely together. At Ice, the ice cream start off liquid. Once everything is perfectly put together, it is flattened on the cold stone and once hardened, it's rolled up in a few rolls that stay up straight in your cup! We topped it off with 1 more Oreo and mini mochi bites. Finally, we got the Nutella drizzle. The process took less than 10 minutes and the result was very tasty.

After seeing their cookbook at Barnes & Noble a few weeks ago, I was even more excited to try this place.WAIT: Came at 11am on a Saturday and it was still a 45 minute wait for 2 people. We waited about 50 minutes total. We ended up just walking around Nolita and then came back at the 40 minute mark to wait around. ATMOSPHERE: It's pretty small inside, total with tables and counter it holds 30 people. Even when you're sitting you are very close to the people next to you, the kitchen, and the waiters walking around. I like the trendy music they play and the teal accents. Very Instagram worthy, cute, brunch place.FOOD: Husband got the BEC and I got the custom egg sandwich.BEC - panini roll, which is almost like a cross between a ciabatta roll and brioche bun. It comes with a tomato jam/jalapenos, cheese, sunny side up egg and bacon. It has a southwestern taste because of the tomato and jalapeños. The bun is OK...I think compared to Eggslut, the bun at Eggslut is much better. Overall, I actually wasn't SUPER impressed with this sandwich. But it's not bad for only $10.CUSTOM EGG SANDWICH - starts out with $7 and then you add more for the additional add ons.EGG: sunny side, scrambled or...poached? There was a third option but I can't remember what it was. I got the sunny side up egg and it was definitely runny! Sadly part of it was already spilled out when it came to me.BREAD: got the biscuit, it's a pretty good biscuit, very crunchy on the outside and very soft on the inside. Reminded me of an upgraded version of a Popeyes biscuit. $1 extra for the biscuit.CHEESE: Vermont cheddar, hardly tasted it in the sandwichSPREAD: caramelized onion aioli also very subtle flavorMEAT: got sausage which came like a sausage patty, good flavor (slight pink on the inside, which was interesting). $3 extra.Overall, my sandwich was a very standard breakfast sandwich (think biscuit sandwich from mcdonalds) but elevated because of the quality of the ingredients. To be honest though, I wouldn't say I was blown away by the flavors. The price isn't bad, the atmosphere nice but the wait is long so I wouldn't wait more than an hour for this.

254,32,17,4.0,"Kura had been on my mind for several years, given the fact that there was very little publicity given to the restaurant as well as the overwhelmingly positive feedback that came from friends. The man behind the counter is Noriho Ishizuka, a veteran chef who looks more like a welcoming grandfather than a stern sushi chef. My guest was running behind our reservation time, and he looked over at the seat next to me while I waited, giving a stern shake of his head. ""No good,"" he scolded my imaginary guest with a slight smile at the corner of his mouth.When it comes to the sushi, however, Ishizuka-san clearly takes his craft with great seriousness. There are few places that prepare and serve sushi in such a traditional, purist form, and Kura does the art of omakase justice. There are several options for omakase, starting with 12 pieces and spanning upwards to 20 pieces with additional kappo-style dishes. My guest and I opted for the 12-piece, and despite thinking that it wouldn't be quite substantial, we both left more than satisfied with the meal.We were started off with two small plates; the first, consisting of marinated tuna and tororo (grated yam) and the second, a beautifully plate bowl of sushi rice, ikura, and nori slices. Both were light bites with delicate flavors, but I have to admit that my preferences lies with the second dish; the simplicity of the bowl and the pairing of the ingredients worked in perfect harmony, especially as I enjoyed the pops of brineyness of the ikura.The 12 pieces of nigiri that followed were all expertly constructed and each was a delight. The starting piece, a soft chutoro that was perched on a block of perfectly seasoned, loose sushi rice, was one of my favorites; it had just the right amount of fattiness and resilience in the tuna, paired with a slightly vinegary rice. We were similarly blown away by the crisp Red Snapper, the slight sweetness of the Scallop, and the edge of char on the Smoked Salmon. A number of pieces were fairly traditional - the Marinated Tuna, Giant Clam, Mackerel, and Unagi (freshwater eel) - but we were also surprised by the octopus, which was highlighted by the yuzukoshu. And the Uni, a delicious piece of Santa Barbara sea urchin, was one of the sweetest pieces I can recall having.The meal finished with a Chutoro hand roll, neatly wrapped in a crisp sheet of toasted nori, a soft block of tamagoyaki, and a fragrant miso soup with mushrooms. And, to finish, a small cube of Green Tea Tiramisu lightly dusted in matcha.For those who truly are looking for a memorable omakase, Kura needs to be on your list. The restaurant is small (~12 seats at the counter), so reservations through Yelp should be made ahead of time. But for what it delivers, it's worth the extra effort.",37,0.9959

The food here has always been consistently good at both of their locations. The one feels a bit less fancy than the other one a few blocks north but is still a comfortable place to dine. Their lunch buffet is solid and I've never had any issues with the flavor or quality of their food. The spread is always solid and the chicken marsala, tandoori chicken and fish curry are among my favorites. I also love the fact they serve pani puri as part of their lunch spread, which is always a nice treat for me.If you're looking for a place that serves a better-than-average selection of lunch buffet items for a reasonable price, this is a great pick. It also helps that the service is solid and folks here are pretty friendly.",31,0.9937

So I'm psyched that DokoDemo can bring you there for under $10.This spot is focused on three categories of classic Japanese street food: yakisoba (noodle stir fry), okonomoyaki (meat and cabbage omelette), and takoyaki (deep fried balls of goodness). These can be filled a wide range of meat: chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, and octopus. There are also a few fried sides rounding out the menu, as well as a fridge of Japanese soft drinks.The atmosphere is very casual, with orders taken at the counter and the food being made right in front of you. You can take out or sit on stools at communal tables. It was a bit warm when I came in; don't know if their air conditioner is up to the heat of the open kitchen combined with New York summer.I went for octopus takoyaki, with 5 for $6.50. It was ready in about 5 or 10 minutes. My balls were gorgeous, with their requisite drizzles of mayo and a sweet teriyaki sauce and topped with aonori and bonito flakes.The batter was delicious-- eggy and umami and loaded with octopus and green onion. Unfortunately, it was undercooked and fell apart completely while eating it. The octopus was very chewy... I had to go traditional for the first time, but I'd choose a different meat next time.Nevertheless, I'm excited to try out the rest of the menu, and I love that this spot exists so close to me!",23,0.9523

The FCK sandwich is like an upgraded version of your standard BEC and all of the flavors work perfectly. Ingredients are fresh and I've never had such an interesting combo of chipotle mayo, black bean spread, avo, and the fluffiest little square omelette, bacon, all wrapped up with some veggies between a slightly sweet potato bun - the sandwich kind of reminded me of a shack burger. It was a pretty big sandwich that kept me super full for a long time. GET IT!!My friend's avo and ricotta toast was alright, felt like it was missing something so I recommended that she drizzle some honey over it and it was a good idea! Can't go wrong with ricotta, honey, and avo :) another thing was that the toast was too toasted, would be better if it was more chewy!Also, the pastries and cookies look bomb, the cookies remind me of ben's cookies.It's a really new place that opened up about a month ago and they're still experimenting with their menu but I have no doubt they'll do well.

We were welcomed by a friendly staff, and got seated on the last available table at 7pm on a busy Sunday evening. Black miso chicken: I don't usually order chicken bc it bores me to death, but this small dish was tasty, mostly because of the rich miso sauce. Salty pork belly: the pork belly was tasty, and the sauce super yummy, but the shishito pepper that came with the dish stole the show: it was phenomenal. Tuna tataki: it's a pity that these pieces of delectable tuna were completely overpowered by the black pepper sauce. Una tama don: fantastic combo of flavors; you must get this, and if you don't like eel, I can only feel sorry that you'll never have the chance to appreciate this dish.

Hadn't planned on seeing it, and tickets are tough to come by and you can't get a discount but a friend had an extra and asked me to attend so I thought I'd see what the hub bub was about.This is an old fashioned musical and it's a little corny and sugary, but the cast does a terrific job and I was completely entertained the entire time. Obviously, Bette Midler is the focus and she is great. She's 70+ so her voice isn't the same as it was 30 years ago but she can still belt it out and she really is the queen of comedy. With just a look (from the parts of her face that move..some don't and it's a bit distracting) she can bring down the house and the dining room scene is a show stopper.The best part is that the rest of the cast rises to the challenge and they don't let her steal all the scenes.  David Hyde Pierce is terrific, even with a terrible ""Noo Yawk"" accent. Gavin Creel, Kate Baldwin and especially Beanie Feldstein can hold their own and then some. The dancing is top notch, the songs are pleasant and 2.5 hours sails by.

262,19,9,4.0,"Sushi Ishikawa has a lot to offer to this neighborhood and the sushi game in general. At the comparably lower price point next to other sushi restaurants, expect a solid and highly impressive omakase by chef Don Pham. They offer two omakase menus, 12-course at $85 and 15-course at $125. There is no a la carte with valid reason, though I admit to missing this as an option. We opted for the 15-course for our first visit. It was extremely easy booking for two at the chef's counter through Resy app for a Friday night, a week ahead of our dinner. They seat only about 11 at the counter, and there are a few tables. It's a cute, small and modern space, and their staff is extremely friendly, personable, and kind. The chef was serving and his wife was there as a hostess.List of the sushi we had and in the order of which we had them (the best I could describe from my knowledge) --Black snapper (mild and smooth, great start to the meal)Japanese barracuda with ginger garnish (probably one of my favorites; very flavorful and nice for something that seemed deceptively simple)Clam (flavor almost like a scallop though with more bite) Prawn (nice hint of spice as part of the topping, and and it just melts in your mouth)Japanese Whiting (very mild, though this might be one of my least favorite)Smoked Skipjack Tuna (has a little limey flavor added, a nice punch at the end)Smoked Trout (reminds me of rich salmon, so smooth and probably one of my favorites as well)Japanese Sea Urchin with truffle (very tasty; it's Uni!)Japanese egg custard with mushrooms and shrimp (much like a silky tofu, comforting dish)Seared Bluefin Tuna with ponzu (good though lighter in flavor than expected)Stripejack with Uni (in a rich orange sauce, this was a very bold dish that I found hard to swallow after the custard)Amber Jack (unique and spicy)Sea scallop with Uni (served in a creamy uni jus; definitely a winner)Fatty Tuna with sturgeon caviar (this was really lovely and just delicious) Hand roll with tuna and salmon roe (simple and clean hand roll that was a nice finisher to our meal)At the end, they served a very refreshing and delicious yuzu sake alongside organic melon for dessert. My only complaint while eating was having been served the egg custard midway into the meal. It was tasty but also a very hot dish, and I felt rushed to finish it in order to get to the next course. Also the contrast of the hot dish to the sushi threw off my meal, and I may have preferred it towards the end. If I were to do the 15 course again, I would opt to just do another piece of sushi in replacement. There were outstanding pieces, nonetheless, and I enjoyed the unique sauces and garnishes. The rice was nice and warm in each piece. The fish was fresh and excellent quality. As the meal goes on, you will notice an elevation in complex flavors. The fatty tuna with caviar we had that night was not served with gold leaf, and I am not sure if that is a special request, but I was bummed it wasn't served as a part. All in all, this was a fantastic omakase, and I have recommended to many to give it a go. Especially at the price point in this neighborhood, it's certainly something to consider for your next omakase.",24,0.9969

We sat at the tempura bar, enabling us to watch the chef make fresh tempura for its customers. For $40, this meal was well worth a try. There was plenty of food to leave me feeling happy full. We got an assortment of shrimp and vegetable tempura on top of rice with a side of hot udon and little vegetable small bites. Everything was really delicious. There is a difference in broth between the soba and udon which was impressive. The udon had more of lime taste while the soba had more of a lemon taste. The tempura itself was just a tad softer than I would like it to be but the ingredients were splendid. Shrimp, peppers, squid, mushrooms, etc.At the end of the meal, we got some tempura vanilla ice cream. Also very delicious with a good hit from the fresh strawberry on the side.

Do it.In the space formerly inhabited by Northern Spy, Raclette has done a pretty good job gaining a following with all the cheese pull videos, and cheese wheel scrapes. When you enter the restaurant, you're immediately hit with the smell of stinky cheese, and that does not go away, so perhaps, make sure to wear older clothes. Not to mention, the space is very cramped, so you'll be in close contact with other people's raclettes too.Raclette suisse: potatoes, arugula, cornichons, and prosciutto di parma, all with a double scrape of raclette over the potatoes. After the first scrape, make sure to leave some potatoes, so they can come back and give you a complimentary second scrape. Perhaps best to come during the day for lunch, so the lighting is better for when you take a video of that first big cheese scrape. Do it for the gram, am I right?Croque havana: Similar to a Cuban sandwich, there was plenty of meat, and the pickles and Swiss cheese really do a great job of cutting through the richness of the pork. Nothing too out of the ordinary, but executed quite well.Service was really friendly, but it was so busy that it was hard to wave them down. The price was very reasonable for the portion, and it only ended up being about $20 per person without drinks. Pretty great for the amount of food you get.A great choice for a lower key meal in the East Village, and especially if you're in the mood for some cheese.

Gotan, however busy they maybe, still feels welcoming and not stifling. I was able to grab a seat very quickly and noticed that there were still plenty of open spots left. Perhaps the customers in the area are in too much of a rush to sit and relax. Anyways more open space for me!

We had to ask for water several times and it took about 10 minutes for a server to greet us when we had been seated. The bus boy was good about clearing our table but the people kept walking around with our dishes asking every table if thats what they ordered.

278,19,14,4.0,"Full of trepidation, I bring my beloved old-school, steel Schwinn to Larry's, unsure if they can fix my warped wheel. Before walking into the store, I confess I had looked at other bike options just in case they told me my beloved Schwinn was not worth repairing. I wheel my bike in and the guy, who I assume works there--he could've been a random shopper for all I knew, picks up my bike, pulls a spoke out and mumbles, ""Yeah, this is broken. Hm...I'm not sure I can fix it."" And without another word (no price quote, discussion, nothing), he wheels my bike to the back of the store. Tears threaten to well up in my eyes as my outstretched hand grasps the air where my bike once was. Unsure if I will ever see my bike again, I start to aimlessly look around at the other bikes in the store. I notice many large red signs with the words SALE written on them. ""Um, you guys have some bikes on sale today?"" I say with a shaky voice. The other guy in the store moving around heavy boxes grunts, ""Yeah, some of 'em."" He then continues pushing heavy boxes.I try again, ""A lot of work today huh?"" ""Yeah, well every day."" He shrugs while shoving a box behind a bike. Silence. After a few minutes, by when I'm sure he's forgotten about me completely, he points to a Canondale on sale for $325, ""This one's your size."" I contemplate asking him if I can test ride it but am hesitant. Is he going to be annoyed that I'm asking him to do something extra? Does he know that I'm a serious buyer here, that I could be convinced to abandon my 20-year-old bike for a shiny new one? Wait, am I really ready for all that? Where is my beloved Schwinn? I don't even know what's happening to it! In a moment of panic I run to the back of the store looking for my old bike. What is happening? I find my bike on a stand with the greasy bike repairer person (by now I've decided that he does indeed work there. He seems to know his way around and no one is yelling at him for using the tools). He looks at me and says, ""Yeah, I'm working on it."" I say ""Oh, okay"" and slowly back my way out of the bike operating room and go back to ogling the Canondale. In order to pass the time, I end up purchasing a replacement wheel for my kid's Micro Scooter, which somehow costs a whopping $11. It is way overpriced and I must say, these Micros are a racket. Good thing we found ours on the street for free. Buying the wheel felt good, like I knew what I was doing in the store. Like I belong in this world of non-communicative grease monkeys. Then grease monkey #1 wheels my bike back up to the front of the store, spins my back wheel for me to see it's all fixed and hands my bike back to me. ""Um, how much?"" I venture. ""10 bucks.""""Oh, sweet!"" I'm elated and relieved. My baby is back to working order and for only $10! The guy then also replaced a screw on the rear bike rack free of charge.

This seems to be a favorite spot for birthdays and I'm impressed that they have 3 extensive floors that all have very different vibes and consistently good music...if you're into hip hop :)One floor up from ground floor is their covered terrace with quaint street lamps and park benches that makes it feel like you're in a park and a rooftop at the same time, even though you aren't really in either. It's charming, and a marked difference from downstairs. The closest comparison I can think of is the rooftop terrace in Berry Park in Brooklyn, and that's a compliment!Ground floor is your typical darkened lounge with a bar, a few tables you can buy, and a large dance floor. The music tends to be throwback top 40s hip hop to a decade or more ago and I love it (think Destiny's Child, 50 Cent, lil Wayne, Wale and Kanye). There are bathrooms on this floor, and the bouncer is good at keeping an eye on them to make sure no one is passed out / taking forever. By about 1130pm/midnight, this floor gets pretty crowded, which means it's time to go upstairs or downstairs, depending on what vibe you want. One floor down is the basement, and things definitely get a grimier down there, and that's the point. Neon blue lighting, low ceilings and all. Coat check is down here and there's also bathrooms. +1 for bathrooms on each floor. The only complaint I've heard about this place is the door policy is pretty weird. I've not had an issue personally, but I've heard weird stories, like 3 girls not be able to get in, or getting questioned if you're on a list or have a reservation.

I also love the chocolate-chocolate cookie, and the blueberry and cream - so many different types of treats that aren't really found anywhere else. The fidi location is convenient to all the Pier 11 ferries, right off Wall Street next to the water. However, this location is only a walk-up window, and can produce lengthy waits. It's also located under a very noisy ventilation fan, as others have noted, which can make it difficult to enjoy your treat. You're better off walking around the corner to the waterfront, where there are picnic tables and benches - be sure to bring lots of napkins!",37,0.9811
281,27,16,4.0,"If you have ever had to refrain from naming your child Camembert or Gruyere, for fear they would be incessantly bullied, Aldi is the place for cheese lovers like you. I had to upgrade Aldi because of the strides it has made in adding organic produce, truly lovely cheeses and for the good sales on produce. Are many of the brands no names you might shy away from? Well, just be selective, as I am. I always pop in just to check out the cheese. They won't cost you $20-$30 a lb but you can stock up and offer a cheese plate for that amount. I recommend sticking to the cheeses made overseas, like the exquisite cheddars I have found. Their guacamole is good too. Foraging here can produce Naked smoothies, brioche from France, and organic salad mixes(though beware the expiration dates!) . I tried their Belgium chocolate chips for baking and found them sub standard but I just won't buy them again. Shop smart. So the place has lighting that will age you and sometimes looks like a dump. You're here for the savings anyway.",28,0.9523

One of my favorite summer activities :)With a name such as ""taste the world"" my expectations were a bit different, I was expecting a lot more international exotic foods, as well as more vendors. Nevertheless I still had a great time. There was a good turnout of attendees, but not overly crowded and the lines went very quickly. The variety of ethnic foods was as follow:  Indian, Spanish, Caribbean, Greek, Korean, Chinese, and Japanese.The highlight for me were the desserts. I really enjoyed the fresh Belgium chocolate mousse from chef Johan Halsberghe, it was so delicate, smooth and rich. I felt as if I was eating a fine dessert from a Michelin rated restaurant.I also very much enjoyed the Egg waffle with vanilla ice cream, Gai Dan Jai Wowfulls. I chose the vanilla rainbow color ice cream, with fruity pebbles and a drizzle of chocolate fudge. This was a fun treat to eat and very shareable.It was definitely a nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon.",26,0.9941

It seemed crowded but the place is pretty big for New York standards so it's not hard to get a table.ATMOSPHERE: it reminds me of a cross between Cheesecake Factory and yard house. It's super big inside with a downstairs that seats even more people. Lots of large groups, large tables and booths. Loud music playing (throwbacks from the 90s and then songs from today). It looks like people would come here when they are celebrating or with large families.FOOD: They essentially have 3 things on their menu: burgers, lobster, and lobster rolls. There are the cheap versions and then the nicer versions with more add ons. Their famous ""combo"" is the Combo for 1 which is $33 and you get a 6 oz burger (cheese, lettuce, onions, pickles), fries, salad, and 1.5 lb lobster. Pretty good deal if you consider how much lobster usually costs. They let us split it so between the 2 of us, we got half a burger and half a lobster...it's definitely enough for 2 people but you won't feel super full.BURGER - medium rare is pink but definitely not like some of the more gourmet places. the 6 oz is pretty small, I think most burger places are 8-10 oz. The bun has sesame seeds on it and is decent, overall the burger is nothing spectacular but is a solid decent burger. The flavor was good.LOBSTER - got it steamed and it was so juicy! Each bite and crack had juices pouring out. We got the lemon garlic butter sauce, which is like a creamy buttery sauce, pretty good. The lobster is already cut in half so it's easy to fish out the meat. It was good quality (from what I can tell, I'm no expert). You get 1 claw and then half a body.SALAD - pretty good, small cup, well dressed (balsamic?) and tasty.FRIES - also surprisingly good, thin shoestring type with a slight crunch. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for a fun dinner that is a little ""different"" and if you like burgers and lobster, you'll like this place. I would come back next time for the lobster roll.",27,0.9988

All of this becomes compounded with the happy hour prices AND the fact that on Friday and Saturday evenings there is live music. Live music it is, as we along with others were serenaded and asked for requests. The lead guy really is a ton of fun and knows just how to rile up a crowd. This place is solid but it is a disappointment that it is smaller than it looks. There is only one bathroom available, though it is well maintained so no problems there. Bar seating is pretty minimal, with only about 6 stools so plan accordingly depending on your group size. Service was consistently effective, but non-intrusive.This place definitely stood up to the challenge and I wish I had stopped enjoying the food to take more pictures but the fun of the evening trumped any effort in that regard.

As a girl raised from the South, and when I found out that the restaurant is owned by Food Network star Cat Cora, I knew I had to try this place.Currently, the bar opens at noon and the restaurant at 5pm for dinner, they're expecting to open up for brunch and lunch the weekend of 6/24. I came here with a coworker and we sat outside despite the super hot day.First off, the cocktail menu has pictures! I ordered a gin cocktail and my coworker ordered a cocktail with whiskey. My drink had blackberries and raspberries in it - a perfect summer drink, not too sweet which was to my liking. The drinks and the glassware are beautifully decorated.We ordered the mac and cheese, which comes with a side of cornbread. The mac and cheese - easily the best mac and cheese I've ever had, better than those gourmet mac and cheese restaurants. It's excellent. Being from the south I'm pretty picky with cornbread, but this was perfect - the texture, the flavor, everything.My coworker and I ordered the salmon and the cheeseburger, as well as sweet potato fries on the side, and shared everything. The salmon was delicious, cooked at medium rare and placed on a bed of slightly sweet veggies, bringing out the natural sweetness of the corn. It was amazing yet simple, definitely one of the best salmon dishes I've had. The cheeseburger was good, although it tasted like a fancy In-N-Out burger. Not sure if I'd come back for the burger.The sweet potato waffle fries were good, especially with the brown sugar butter. However, I wish the fries were a little crispier and less thick. Tasty nonetheless.Service was excellent! The wait staff are so kind.I will definitely be back to try more of the dishes, unfortunately since they had just opened, the entire menu isn't available yet. I can't wait to try the chicken and waffles, and the biscuits! I'll be coming back to try the boozy milkshakes and get some more of that amazing mac and cheese!",30,0.9967
287,27,18,4.0,"I had been eyeing Milk Burger since before it opened; I remember when I was in Mott Haven last year I saw signs for it coming soon and was instantly intrigued. Since today was my day off and I had time to kill I decided to stop here for lunch. First off, I really need to applaud this company for opening their first location outside Manhattan right here in the Bronx. With all the Manhattan hot spots seeping into Brooklyn and Queens, it's nice to see my borough getting some love first. The space isn't large at all, but they make good use of it by having stools along the windows and counters, as well as tables strategically placed throughout to maximize space. Decor is mainly woods, think along the lines of Shake Shack.The menu is typical of most other fast foodish burger places, but I did find that Milk Burger had a larger selection of types of burgers and fries. I decided to go with a regular Milk Burger (single patty - you can order a double) with a side of fries. I decided to have it with everything - lettuce, tomato, cheese, onion, pickles, and Milk sauce. The burger was good - full of flavor, not too sloppy, and the perfect size. Note that the Milk sauce is mustard based, so if you're not a mustard fan go without or ask for it on the side. The fries were good but pretty run of the mill. I picked up some sweet potato fries to go and those were better - they had a nice spice to them which made them stand out. You can order online to pick up if you'd like, and they have a rewards program too - though just walking in and ordering I only waited like 5 to 7 minutes at the most. If you are staying to eat, the staff will serve your food to you - a nice perk. I'm happy I finally got to experience Milk Burger - definitely a welcome addition to the Bronx.",33,0.9963

My friends got wings and I had a couple and boy, were they excellent.Only drawback is the limited restroom space.

Studio 9C is appropriately situated on the 9th floor of 30 Rockefeller Center. Accessible only to those with building access, it's mostly populated with NBCUniversal employees. The commissary is brightly constructed, with high ceilings and plenty of breathing room despite the volume of patrons. During lunch hour, it's filled to the brim, but I always find a table. The far end of the dining space is lined with windows which overlook Rockefeller Plaza, an incredible vantage point to look at the Rock Center tree and skating rink during the winter. Along the elevators are props from NBCUniversal films/shows as well as a mysterious giant wall of fake leaves (which looks nice and improves my mood, but I'm uncertain of its purpose).The food is typically stellar. The aforementioned bacon & cheddar eggs is a vital part of my day. There's something biological going on when I consume it before work. Without that fuel, I'm a shell of a man. A worthless hunk of flesh and bones. Come lunch time, there's always an interesting chef special and literally any kind of food you might otherwise desire. Sushi, burgers, pizza, salads, a variety of meats, Mexican cuisine, American grilled fare - everything! After rush hours, the place is largely vacant. Unfortunately the cafeteria closes before dinner, but the dining area is open 24/7, a great space to relax and enjoy your take-out. Occasionally events are hosted here, at which point it transforms into a stellar party space.Studio 9C is an essential part of the NBCU experience, a great place to bring guests for a view of down-below and culinary delights from around the world.

I got the swirl of sesame and green tea and found both flavors to complement each other well. The sesame was nicely pronounced but not overwhelming. As toppings, I got the mochi and the wafer stick. The mocha had a cute presentation and the wafer stick hit the spot for a much needed crunch. The taikayi itself was good. It held the gigantic ice cream well and the actual taste is what I would expect. I filled it with custard cream because I just love that but when I got to it, there wasn't much.

292,69,48,4.0,"Quite excellent. After wanting to try for a while, I finally got a chance with a group of friends for a late Sunday night dinner. ABC Kitchen is one of my go-to restaurants in the city, and I've liked what I've seen from Chef Dan Kluger, so I figured I had to give Loring Place a shot. The menu is pretty similar, and seems to be very reflective of seasonal availability. The space itself is pretty modern-looking (also like the space at ABC Kitchen), and low-lit at night.Our favorites:- Spicy meatball pizza: Pretty standard, but the spicy meatballs were really tender and flavorful. Heh.- Dates pizza: The dates and the bacon made for a really good mix with the wood-fired pizza crust.- Baked ricotta with kabocha squash: This was really good, and we kept asking for more bread to dip into it.- Ricotta agnolotti with shaved black truffle: This dish is around $60, mostly because they shave a ton of black truffle on top. And it's totally worth it.- Seared scallops with sunchokes, apples, and lime: the fruit and sweet flavors actually went very well with the richness of the oil and the seared scallops. One of the best seared scallop dishes I've had in a while.Service was very attentive throughout the night, although it was hard to pinpoint who our actual server was, because it kept changing throughout the night. Nonetheless, we had a great time, and kept the drinks flowing. Prices are about on par with that of ABC Kitchen, so while it is a higher price point, you can at least know that everything is well-executed, with ingredients sourced from a lot of local farms.Overall, the concept is very similar to that of ABC Kitchen, but has a good number menu items give Loring Place its own flavor.

Both hit the spot. My BFF and I searched all of NYC for biscuits & gravy on his birthday, and Good Enough once again proved their awesomeness with their ""Deep South"" dish.

It was prepared quickly, and then I paid. I was happy to see they accepted credit cards. I don't think they had at the old location, unless I just hadn't been since they did. The bagel was massive with lots of white fish, and it was good! The white fish wasn't too salty, and I didn't find one bone in it! The bagel was pretty good too. A little fluffy, but not too dense.

Diced mushroom with the distinct taste and scent of truffles! The waitress told us we had 'refined palates' as she had been told that the truffle was an added touch not easily noticeable. *humble brag* - Mushroom Dumplings - 6 to a serving - $10Now, being that the chef of Pinch Chinese came from the Michelin rated soup dumpling chain, Din Tai Fung, the soup dumplings here were nothing to sneeze at. As expected, the pork soup dumplings here were delicious!

I got the lauded Fairfax: scrambled eggs with chives, cheddar, caramelized onions, and sriracha mayo in a warmed and buttered brioche bun. WOW. The eggs were perfectly cooked - fluffy with a tiny bit of jiggle, the cheese was perfect, and the caramelized onions sealed the deal. The brioche bun was out of this world, so hedonistically buttery! The girl that hates eggs nine times out of ten found that egg dish that throws the curve a bit.

The falafel sandwich was probably one of the best I've had in a while after my favorite place closed up shop. The falafel balls were super fresh and moist. The sandwich itself was loaded with great tasting hummus and fresh veggies and held up great meaning it wasn't a soggy mess.The eating area needs to be cleaned just a little more often. Dirty napkins littered the floor which is a little unappealing when checking a place out for the first time. Employee moral might need a boost in this place too as the back of house peeps seemed a bit miserable.There isn't much more to add to this popular falafel spot because after all the premise of falafel is supposed to be simple street food. Do expect to pay $10-15 for your meal. Simple street food prices right? I'd recommend this place if you could find an area to eat.,13,0.9813

Onto the bar area we sat, that, or endure a half hour wait, and our bellies said No thank you!Even though it was crowded, we didn't need to wait too long for our orders. The Montauk brew and Summer in the Garden drink were yummy! The Messy breakfast sandwich is delicious. You can taste the butter everywhere on your palate! The burger and fries were pretty tasty as well. I'm not a huge pickle fan but I can tell by the texture of them that they are made in- house (confirmed by the bartender that this is true).We will definitely return here. Everything we ordered was delicious. Could've eaten more!",43,0.9813

I ordered the Caesar salad, lobster ravioli's, and the chocolate cake. The caesar salad was good, nothing out of the ordinary. The ravioli's were amazing! So tasty and filling. I would definitely go back for them :) The only reason I am giving the restaurant a 4 out of 5 is because the chocolate cake was subpar. It was served freezing cold which made it hard and have no flavor. I think if the cake was served room temperature it may have been better.The service was great and the atmosphere is nice. I would go back again with work colleagues. My colleagues had the salmon entrée and said it was good as well.Sorry no pictures. I did not want to be rude in front of work people :(",21,0.9542

I didn't realize how often I pass by and didn't realize it was right here... but then again, it is a speakeasy... and a well hidden one at that! I've heard from many people how great Mulberry Project is, so I am so glad I finally got to check it out myself. We didn't get to sit at the bar because it was a crowded Friday night, however we were able to get a table on the side near the dj booth, so we were quite pleased with that. It was a nice little private nook, great for catching up with friends and having a few delicious drinks! You can order off the menu or you can pick your spirit and one or two items, and the bartender will make you something magical that puts the ingredients well together. Overall, it's pretty chill here- everyone is quite laid and and not pretentious (like some speak easys/ cocktail bars can be). The drinks are all beautifully presented and also are quite tasty! Just wish they had a little more kick to them- but that's probably just because I drink too much in general and nothing quite really hits me anymore. I probably have a drinking problem, but I'm not quite concerned about it yet. Anyway, I do love me some bespoke cocktails! Can't wait to come again on another night! Really love how the door is quite hidden and really is an authentic speak easy- we need more of these in Manhattan!",24,0.9974
310,18,13,4.0,"Solid lunch stop, really nice staff, lots of spots to sit even during lunch hour & good prices. Well, I find it cheap - not as cheap as some hole in the wall Mexican places but a hell of a lot cheaper than most fancy sit down Mexican places for dinner. Tacos are about $3 each so you can easily order 3 for under $10 - that's more than enough for lunch! Shout out to the cashier who gave me a plastic cup after I didn't order a drink, thanks! They have water on tap in the back btw. I highly recommend the carne asada even if it's a bit more expensive - worth it, super tender! And you gotta try the masa fries - best new trend, I hope it catches on!! French fries made with corn dough - half fry half tortilla chip!! Great with their dip.Hmm, next time I'll try the horchata drink. Very simple menu so its fast and not confusing to order. Prep time is super quick if you're in a rush.",20,0.9881
311,32,17,4.0,"When Tim Ho Wan first opened in Manhattan at the end of 2016, I was flabbergasted at the multi-hour waits that immediately ensued. Compound that with the fact that it was in the middle of winter, and I resolutely assured myself that I would wait several months until the hype died down... That is, until several of my friends coordinated a trip here on the morning of New Years Day.If not for the fact that our rare early bird of a riser and runner was here to get our place in line before 9AM (thank you Elaine!), I would not have been able to rouse myself in time to get a reasonable seating. They seem to have a system in place now, and will text guests as tables are ready, so there's no need to wait in line outside for the full duration. There's a fair number of tables and booths available, and unlike your typical dim sum joint, the interior is modern, spacious, and clean. Ordering is also simple and straightforward; simply mark the dishes on a sheet of paper and hand it to your server, who may also note any dishes that aren't available as well.As a whole, I was impressed with all of the dishes we tried. The much-loved Cha Siu Bao (Roast Pork Bun) is definitely worth the hype; what it lacks in size, it makes up for in its flaky, buttery shell reminiscent of a traditional pineapple bun and the sweet-savory interior that's comprised of fatty and lean cuts of pork. I also appreciate the fact that I could actually see the shreds of radish in the Pan Fried Turnip Cake, and that I could taste the distinct ingredients. The Pork Siu Mai were plump and juicy, the Har Gao tender and perfectly wrapped, and the Rice in Lotus Leaf was steamed to the perfect consistency and had generous amounts of lap cheong and chicken interspersed throughout. We also ordered the Spare Ribs, the Steamed Bean Curd with Meat and Vegetables, the Steamed Egg Cake (which reminded me of egg custard-y sponge cake), the Beef Rice Roll, and two of the desserts (Pumpkin Cream and Osmanthus with Goji)... The wonderful and terrible thing about dim sum is that it's so easy to keep on wanting to try more and more dishes, especially when dining in a large group. Also worth noting is that the sambal available at each table is significantly better than the typical jarred versions you'll find in supermarkets; there's plenty of heat and body in each spoonful, and I could actually see the ground chilis and garlic in the sauce.At the end of the day, I'm not sure I can fairly say that the entire effort of waiting several hours to get inside and seated is worth it. That obstacle aside, however, I think the elevated prices (ranging from $4.50-$5.50 per dish) is certainly justified, especially when considering the quality of the ingredients and the actual composition in each plate. Perhaps in a few months when the weather is warmer and the lines are shorter, you'll find me back here again...",47,0.9913

Though, technically, this bar is firmly Hell's Kitchen Territory, planted right on the corner of 44th and 9th.The interior was pretty and low-key, with pleasant holiday decorations in early December. Beer list was respectable: enough good choices without making your head spin over too many tips.

Otherwise, they do offer reservations for groups of 6 or more but you have to have a preset menu.ATMOSPHERE: The bar is slightly awkward because there isn't enough space to really hang out and not get in someone's way whether it's the waiters or people walking to their table or other people ordering drinks. We stayed there about 30-45 minutes before leaving.FOOD: Get the capri sun drinks! They are $12 ($9 on thursdays) and super fun, cute, picture worthy and actually tasty.LYCHEE CAPRI SUN DRINK - I BARELY tasted the soju and I always taste the alcohol, believe me. I'm also a super light weight so sharing this I was totally fine. It has soju, mango and lychee. There are actual lychee bits inside the drink, it has a more tart/sour taste almost like grapefruit which I think helps cut through any soju taste. It also has a light up cube in it, which they actually ran out of so we had to go back to the bartender when they collected more.My friend got the strawberry/red one and it tasted like fruit punch AND has a little garnish, making it look more tropical-y.Overall, despite the space constraints and no reservations I really liked this place and would take people again.",20,0.9928
314,22,13,4.0,"This place is iconic! Opened for over 50 years, the joint serves Chinese and Spanish food. I thought the food would be Chinese food meets Spanish food, but really, it's just a menu that serves both types of food, sometimes on the same plate, and it's totally cool (and carb-y, and oily). We ordered the special combo plates. Both of our entrees came with the special fried rice that had two types of pork and shrimps with scallion. It was very tasty!!! I ordered the combo with broccoli, pork and brown sauce. It comes with a fried veggie roll. The hubs got a combo plate with the same Chinese fried rice and a Spanish grilled steak topped with onions. We were given a bread basket. And fortune cookies at the end! It was a fun food dinner, we had a ton of leftovers, the bill was super cheap, and best of all, the guys working there were super awesome!

315,18,11,4.0,"Upon walking into Amy Ruth's, you can tell that this place truly does have an immense sense of history. I came on a Friday night at 8pm with a party of two and was seated immediately. For their entrée, I got the ReverendSharpen (chicken and waffles). This dish was extremely satisfying and is everything I was looking for in chicken and waffles. First off, their portion size was large, with two large perfectly friend pieces of chicken and a large waffle. While I wanted to order additional sides at first, I was happy I did not since I was so full by the time I finished my meal. I would highly recommend that you order a sweet tea with the meal in order to further make the experience that much better, however, the sweet tea is extremely sweet so keep that in mind. I tried my girlfriend's sides of fried okra and mac and cheese and was not greatly impressed. Most of it was personal preference where they bake their mac and cheese and lightly fry their okra. If you like that style then you will love those sides, I just do not prefer it. Overall great meal and would recommend coming if you want to blow your tourists friends away with the best fried chicken in Harlem.",22,0.9946

Since it was freezing outside, I stood by the door to check Yelp again when suddenly the hostess runs out to get me and says ""We just had a table open up!"".  Happy for our good luck, we were led to a table in the back and were able to enjoy a terrific meal. My friend had an omelet which she absolutely loved. I had a waffle, plain with just butter and syrup. The butter had big chunks of sea salt on it and the waffle was perfectly made.  This is seriously the best waffle I've ever had. I've had dreams about that salted butter, mingling with the crisp outside/soft inside waffle, with the salt offset by the sweetness of the syrup. It was so good.Service was great too.

I stopped in for The Truffleist, a Smorgasburg favorite for their truffle cheesesteak and it was amazing as anywhere else I've had it. This location is an improvement over the previous one nestled in between Gansevoort St. which is far less accessible than 14th Street, which is heavily trafficked by passerby heading to and from the High Line.

322,15,17,4.0,"Oh, man. What a long-awaited visit. Since its opening, I've been lusting after King. Reservations have been hard to come by. Expectations grew by the day. You know when you've been on dating apps and you've talked to a potential mate for like 2-3 weeks before actually meeting up with them in person and you build up this fantasy in your head (involuntarily) of how they're going to be, not taking into account that fantasy and reality never match and you're doomed for disappointment, even if the first date goes really well?* Well, that was my experience with King. Our experience here was lovely--maybe even 4.5 stars. High expectations often lead to discouragement, even when reality presents you with something awesome. Apparently this is getting philosophical now. Reeling myself back in here, I'll say that we had a great time at King. Some things were unbelievable, some things were just above-average. Considering King changes its menu daily, inconsistencies are bound to happen. So overall, worth the trip. And I'm intrigued enough to return come spring/summer.Made a reservation for 8:15pm on a Saturday night. MAKE A REZ BEFOREHAND. This place is popular and I don't think it's going away anytime soon. I'll jump right in and say that the service here is fantastic. From the hostess to the bartender to our waiter, everyone was fabulous. We weren't seated in the main dining space right away, so we got to enjoy a couple of adult beverages at a table by the bar while waiting. Cocktail-wise, King offers a nice array of options, most which are on the stronger side (you've been warned). I ended up trying the Cochonnet (Gin, Cognac, Cocchi Americano, Crème de Peche) first, which was spirit-forward but definitely drinkable. A unique flavor--memorable for sure, but not for the faint of heart. My second drink--which isn't on the online menu--was a scotch-based cocktail called the ""Blood and ____"". That's all I've got for ya. To my knowledge, it's the only scotch-based drink on the menu, so just keep an eye out for it. Perfect winter cocktail. This is coming from someone who doesn't even like scotch. If you're more in the mood for wine, be prepared to shell out some serious cash. The cheapest bottles here are in the $60 range, and there aren't many of 'em. Wines by the glass are equally expensive and frankly, not worth considering.As mentioned, King changes its menu daily. A worthy concept, for sure. The dishes I'm about to list may very well not be on the menu when you decide to go. Ingredients are seasonal, so you'll definitely get something different if you check King out in a few months. In any case, the menu is on the small side (not like they can change a diner-sized menu everyday) but there's a nice amount of variety. Our eats, below:Panisse: A-A solid starter, though I wouldn't have said that upon first bite. Pretty bland at first. Not sure what kind of Willy Wonka magic was going on, though, because they managed to improve throughout the nibbling process. Definitely much better with a lemon squeeze (provided). That all said, probably better to order with a larger group of people--these aren't something you'll want to fill up on before the real action starts.Greens/walnuts: A-Because we felt like we needed a veggie. Nothing really to say--simple and refreshing. A nice palette cleanser Scallops/chickpeas: A-Beautifully-cooked scallops, also served with a lemon. This turned me off a bit, simply because 2 out of 3 dishes at this point came with an optional flavoring component. If I'm paying this much, I'd expect the food to be pretty complete, as is. Chickpeas really brought this dish down for me. They looked and tasted like they were left there by accident. Still a good dish overallGnocchi: A+++Utter magic. The couple next to us, who seemed to know the chef, pretty much demanded that we order these. And thank god we did. Though I can't tell you exactly how these were prepared, they were served with some elegant yet decadent cheese. I'm one of those annoying carb-avoiders, and these were worth every bite. The best dish I've had anywhere in 2017. Onglet: ABe prepared: served RARE. Seeing beef this rare always scares me, but that has nothing to do with King. I'm just a weenie sometimes. In any case, this entire dish was delicious. Tasty cut, really yummy polenta (I'm typically not a big polenta fan), topped with some sort of cured meat, which was well-received. A rich, warming dish that was pretty fitting for this cold, snowy night. *Oh, and if you were wondering about that whole dating thing, I am now happily paired up. No thanks to those dating apps, which never panned out for me.",31,0.9991

I got the Pera y Romero which was super refreshing and tasty. The pear and rosemary was great with the rum.We then started with the crispy Brussel sprouts which tasted like general tso chicken but instead with Brussel sprouts. It was very savory and had good crisp from these small round rice crisps. Brussels were roasted nicely. We then shared roasted duck breast which was huge in size, with two large slices of duck with a great charred napa cabbage and a duck jus that complemented the duck well, especially since the duck itself was kind of dry. We also got the braised short rib which was super tender, easily pulled apart by the fork on top of mashed potatoes that was super creamy.

They have an ATM by the door but they really should put a sign up as well.We arrived around 10 minutes late to our reservation since we accidentally google mapped The Broiler room ( don't do that!). Fortunately it was not very busy and the staff was super nice about it. The seafood cost $15 and up by the pound. If you get 2lbs combos it includes corn and potatoes automatically! There are choices for sauces but the boil special which is a blend of all the sauces I believe... they also have a lot of beers available!We ended up ordering some fries, a beer, a coke, and 2lbs of shrimp with the boil sauce and with medium spicy. The restaurant provides bibs and gloves! Which was really nice since your hands don't get super dirty. The food arrived quickly and it was delicious!The fries were crispy and also seasoned nicely. The shrimps were plump and juicy in the sauce although for some reason the veins on the shrimp really bothered me. Normally this is not a big deal but for some reason the veins were very prominent in each shrimp as I peeled away the shells. The sauce as delicious! The butter flavor just hits you in the face. The sauce for me was too buttery and not citrusy enough, but that's because in loooove lemon on my shrimp.

The table is reserved with a bandana, and much like the Michigan motif, we never learn what this represents (conceivably 'the grey dog' once wore it, we only venture to guess).Bravely leaving their coats at the table, vulnerable to theft, the patrons make their way to the counter. It's time to order. What happens next is a blur, but we know they ordered something good. It's now coffee time and the coffee is earthy, textured, delicious, and decidedly hot. No one burns their tongue; this is a great omen. Waiters pace to and fro, shouting names of customers who must claim their food, for if they don't, it will be fed to the grey dog (whom, at this juncture, we had yet to see). Finally, the man of the group receives his dish. Wouldn't you know it, it's a bacon egg & cheese on a croissant with potatoes. This is hearty, well portioned, and in some ways sweet sweet revenge on the travails of hunger. Yes, a revenge croissant indeed.Everyone is eating now, everyone is getting revenge. But with so much liquid ingested, the man is now getting the urge to expel said liquids. The bathroom is tastefully marked with a red fire hydrant and the man tentatives pulls the door open. It is there that his jaw goes slack. He stares forward, eyes unmoving. He's gazing at a tasteful artist rendering of the grey dog itself. It's so realistic, he almost wants to touch it, but in his heart he knows it wouldn't be furry. It's just a drawing, after all. Right? This raises more questions than it answers - is the grey dog still alive? Is the grey dog a metaphor? What does any of it have to do with Michigan? The friends collect their coats, which were pleasantly NOT stolen, and make their way out. The daylight is piercing, intense, and instantly makes them realize they had taken for granted the quiet, soft homeliness of The Grey Dog.Also, they didn't accept Discover card.",19,0.9796
333,25,18,4.0,"Waited an hour to try Dō - that's my review, the end. I thought I could skip the line by planning my visit on a weekday morning but my, was I wrong. They let you try up to 4 flavors - sounds like it used to be unlimited but sadly that's no longer true, but 4 should be enough for anyone in my humble opinion. The staff is friendly and helpful, and they try to be efficient by moving the line quickly but it looked like the guys were having a hard time scooping. You would think cookie dough's softer than ice cream and easier to scoop but it didn't appear that way. So my scoop ended up being smaller, my two scoops looked like my friend's one scoop. I'll ask for my $7's worth next time, only if his arm wasn't trembling this time..You can choose up to 3 scoops and they can be mixed with ice cream, which is great. But I went all dough this time and chose Confetti and Chocolate Dream on a red velvet cone. I thought those were both good choices. No big surprises but good consistency, delicious cookie dough, and definitely sweet. Chocolate one's a bit sweeter so I prefer the signature. I used to pick out the cookie dough in Ben&Jerry's to save till the end and hog it, so this works very well for me. Although, I would like it to be served cold if possible.It's all very pink inside the store and fun and exciting. There are tables and seats available.",27,0.9974
334,20,13,4.0,"My mom wants me to buy a new sofa. My interior decorating skills rival only those of a 12 year old, so needless to say, the thought of picking out a couch increased my stress level to an unprecedented high. After multiple hours of one of my best friends leading me through West Elm + Crate & Barrel by the hand, I was so Hangry that I could've starred in a Snickers commercial.She suggested Burger & Lobster. At that point, I would've happily eaten sand. We got to the restaurant at about 7:30 on a Saturday night and it was packed. We were quoted at an hour wait for two people, but we were told that the bar was first come, first serve, and that there were bars on both levels of the restaurant. We decided to check out the downstairs bar.There were two seats at the bar when we got down there, so we scooped them up immediately. Our bartender was the absolute SWEETEST. Service was easily 5 stars. He was really friendly & knowledgeable, and didn't pressure us into getting drinks even though we were sitting at the bar. He took one look at us and realized that we were practically ravenous and immediately took our order. We also informed him that my friend is gluten free and he asked us SEVERAL questions to make sure he got our order right, which was awesome. We split:THE LONDON: ($16) 6 oz beef burger with the works, fries, & saladTHE ORIGINAL: ($28) 1.5 pound whole lobster with fries & salad The Burger: Delicious. We ordered ours medium but it honestly came out well done (in my opinion, whatever, but I can see how this would be irritating). The toppings were super fresh, the pickle must've been soaked in magical brine, and you get bacon + cheese for no extra charge. It came with both fries & a small salad. The burger was falling apart a little bit but it was still good. The Lobster: Worth $28? Maybe. Fish itself was fresh and the lemon garlic butter sauce may or may not be made with actual fairy dust. This dish was certainly enjoyable. Fries & salad: Salad was a cute addition - was pretty standard but was nice for breaking up the meal. I loved the fries - they were crunchy.Non-edible comments: -While I felt really good about the pricing of this place, I feel like it isn't as cheap as people give it credit for. $16 for a burger and fries is on the cheaper side in NYC, but it isn't...cheap...either. The drink menu was also standard for NYC ($8 for a Mocktail? What?). The lobster is probably the real deal, but $20-28 isn't really a cheap meal, either. I definitely wasn't complaining about the price, but I am surprised at how people think that this is dirt cheap, because it certainly isn't your local Gray's Papaya.-The crowd at this place is super diverse- you have people in gym clothes & sneakers and in dresses & button downs. Not really a positive or a negative, just a fact. -The bathrooms were fairly gross. Spilled / mostly congealed soap on the floor, severe lack of toilet paper, etc. Overall feelings: B&L exceeded my expectations and filled me up; I was honestly torn between a 4 & a 5 star on this one. We had an awesome experience and I would definitely go back. Next time, though, I hope I can skip the furniture shopping beforehand.",24,0.9987

With a two hour wait for a cracked screen repair, I decided I allowed Yelp to direct me to a restaurant. My husband and I decided to give it a try based on the reviews on Yelp and their website. I am a sucker for a well laid out website for a dining establishment. But seriously you should go look at it. Given it was Christmas Eve and around brunch time I thought it would be a busy time for them. My husband and I walked in and there was only one other table. We decided to grab a table at the bar and we were greeted by the sweetest bartender ever. I forget her name but I do remember she was from Ukraine and we were talking food and everything else. It is nice to come across a bartender that has good convo sometimes. I ordered the french toast and bacon. The french toast could have been a little bit more sweet, and it had very eggy taste. The size of the french toast was enough for two people to share although I only ordered it for myself. Mela East you won me over.

Great tasting, super refreshing, and very different than their standard cider.There's three floors to this establishment.

Unfortunately the rooftop doesn't overlook anything, but it's a nice place to enjoy the weather!In terms of food, there is no happy hour pricing on these, but I love their nachos and wings.

337,14,11,4.0,"Came here with the bf for dinner during restaurant week and had a great experience. Ambiance: Small restaurant overall and isles near tables were pretty tight but the decor of the restaurant gave it a very chill and comfortable vibe. There were some interesting displays of art on the walls and around the restaurant that had me scratching my head but no big deal. There was also a bar with seats, which had happy hour until 7. I tried a passion fruit margarita which was delicious and definitely had its share of tequila. Food: Let me start with the BEST part of the night. The duck confit flautas were the highlight of the entire meal, and I wish they were made as an entree instead of appetizer. Perfectly crisp, a good portion of duck in each bite, and covered in a sauce that had me scraping the plate. I mean, who doesn't like duck and flautas? So paired together, it as a match made in Duck heaven. Me and the bf both ordered the fish tacos as our entree and while he seemed to enjoy them, I couldn't get through 1 whole taco. The slaw they put on it had a weird taste and the fish itself tasted bland, as if it hadn't been seasoned. Dessert was also meh, but possibly because I'm not a big fan of flan or churros. I would definitely go back to La Loteria simply for the duck flautas and because the server I had was very professional and really made the night a special one. Next time, I may opt to sit at the bar for the delicious happy hour margaritas and my duck. Quack!",19,0.9979

Many people heard the good word about Underwest donuts, and finally they've expanded to a small kiosk on the street level outside Penn Station. Yes, the donuts are $3.25ea - and they are a far cry from New York's sole location of Krispy Kreme (read: never has ""Hot Doughnuts Now"" due to their location within Penn Station) downstairs on the Amtrak level. Their ""Carwash"" donut is their signature and most popular, with hints of vanilla and lavender. It's moist, and has just the right amount of sweetness to hold you over. Next time I'll have to try the Banana Milk, their newest creation that's gotten many great reviews! I wasn't a huge fan of the ""Mulled Cider"" donut, but hey, can't love every item on the menu. Just on a coffee break? They have a full espresso menu serving coffee by Joe.

Their blue ""cauldrons"" as I call them are kept on hot plates that keeps their souls forever warm. For the roasted tomato they do a drizzle of balsamic which is just perfect. One piece of recommendation is that they should carry gluten free bread and hopefully can add more soup options that meet dietary restrictions such as mine!",24,0.9795

The giant corns underneath the steaks are really nice--Starchy and flavorful.Ceviche mixto: solid dish. Seafood is fresh and tasty.

What i did like about the hot pot was that the flavor of the broth really did get into all the stuff you put into it. Sometimes, you don't really get the flavor when you scoop out your meat or tofu. Meats: lamb and beef were our fave. pork belly was good too. Others: tofu (all types), lobster dumplings, all veggies were good. quail eggs!! were a pleasant surprise. basically, you can get whatever you want as much as you want. service: was really good. they were very quick about bringing out more meats, tofu, etc. when we asked for more. Drinks: soft drinks included! go ham. but don't waste. got to try a lot of asian drinks which were good. also, yakult ALL YOU CAN DRINK?

344,13,9,4.0,"Make sure you visit the website and reserve your seats prior to coming in, for the best selection. The theaters are much smaller than your typical AMC/Regal so the tickets will sell quickly. There are two tiers: ""Premium"" - seats don't recline and you won't have table service, and ""Premium Plus"" - reclining seats complete with a pillow and blanket, as well as a waiter at your service. I opted for Premium at $18 and was pleasantly surprised at how large and comfortable the seats were, despite not being able to recline. I would recommend you choose the farthest row back from the screen, as the other 2 in front of me would definitely have been too close. The Premium Plus seats are almost twice as expensive - I have tried them at the iPic location back in Maryland and don't necessarily think they're worth the extra money unless you're splurging on a date night. Prior to the movie, I arrived a little earlier and got my own drink at the bar. My friend also got some sweet potato fries. The prices are, of course, a little inflated - it is New York and a luxe theater after all, but I didn't think they were egregious (around $14 incl. tax for a drink, $10 for a generous bowl of fries). The service is a *tad* slow but I can chalk it up to still being green.The facilities are gorgeous, new, clean - definitely one of the better movie-going experiences you will have. One minor complaint is that the bathrooms are one level ABOVE the theaters - so if you need to run out in the middle of a movie, it may take a bit longer than you are used to. Overall, the Premium seats at $18 are on par with the cost of going to AMC/Regal so I would much prefer coming here.",22,0.9869

At this Chelsea outpost of Creamline, you'll find all sorts of comfort foods that will easily expand your waistline, should you go down the hedonistic path and make this your second home. Take solace in the fact that Creamline uses free range eggs, grass fed beef, organic peanut butter--you won't find GMOs in your calories here.The menu's pretty simple. For breakfast, there's staples like pancakes and oatmeal. It's the other foods that snare you into the caloric web. Fried chicken, burgers, fries, and grilled cheese. The only complicated thing is how you are going to work all this off, especially the milk shakes and fried oreos that you will have a difficult time resisting. Eat now, run it off later. Or sleep it off on your couch, if your mode of exercise is clicking on the remote.On opening day, Creamline was generously giving out fried oreos and hot chocolate. I've always avoided the former at fairs, thinking they were just an overly sweet mess fried in cheap oil. Don't, I repeat, don't eschew the ones here. The oreo I had was superb, not greasy, melty and surprisingly not too sweet. You don't taste stale oil. They serve it with a huge dollop of Ronnybrook whipped cream,which you can decline if you want to avoid the hair shirt later. I dumped the remainder of mine into my hot chocolate. Self flagellation? No, not me! The hot chocolate was good, not the best I've had(that is still Jacque Torres), made better when I realized there was a puddle of rich, dark choolate on the bottom of my cup. Stir up the chocolate, and savor it mixed with the milk, the glop of whipped cream on top and the swirl of chocolate sauce. I probably would have given Creamline five stars had they had just a few more vegetarian options but they do well on the simple things they offer, and their best sellers are probably their burgers and fried chicken. For non carnivores, you are limited. On a cold, damp day, I didn't feel like tuna salad. I don't love grilled cheese and tomato soup is something rarely eat. The other non meat option is the grilled PB&J. I should be a responsible adult and not list fried oreos and milkshakes as non meat meal choices, but I'm feeling reckless today. But Creamline to me is a burger joint with milkshakes primarily or a milkshake place with burgers and fries!The store is tiny, with a counter and 8(?) stools for those dining in. On opening day, it was packed but most people ate and were gracious about giving up space. If you find the aroma of cooking grease a turn-on, then by all means linger. Walls are white with colorful lettering on one side and the left is a huge blackboard over white tiles, and the cooks and cashiers. Staff was very friendly.

Come bundled up for the bar but then shed your outer layers to reveal your cute outfit underneath without freezing to death! It's free (you can tip) and hassle free.ATMOSPHERE: When we first got there the DJ was spinning mostly 90s and older hip hop with people surrounding the bar drinking and sitting down. The bar is in the middle in an oval shape with high chairs surrounding it. It's pretty easy to flag down a bartender. As you walk in there's a small dance floor with 4 booths/tables surrounding it and then the bathrooms. There's a little bit of counter space on the sides of the bar for people to stand and drink but overall it's pretty small.CROWD: In the beginning it was mostly couples (20-30 years old) drinking and slightly moving to the beat of a song they liked. There was a small group of people dancing but it wasn't much. The crowd started coming around 11:30 - midnight and then it was popping. I'd say the ratio of girls to guys wasn't bad, there were a few larger groups of girls, mixed groups, a few guys but no one too creepy. Definitely asians and latinos with a few other races mixed in, mostly late 20s to early 30s. The crowd was fun for the most part, a few people who would bump into you and some couples who are just grinding and not caring if they are in the way but overall fun. What I liked was that it was at the perfect capacity, not too crowded where you can't dance or get down but not dead enough where you feel like you're the only one dancing. There was a line outside around midnight and it took our friends some time to get in.MUSIC: From when we got there until about 11:30 it was mostly older hip hop (90s) with a random top 40 song thrown in there and then back to the oldies. It wasn't until midnight where the top 40 hip hop and popular hip hop songs started playing. It was really fun dancing to them and the whole crowd would get excited. There was even a small bit of EDM they played (Calvin Harris/Chainsmokers/Avicii) and there was also a time where there was more latin flavored music.Overall, it was really fun but if you come before 11:30 it's not going to be as crowded and the music will be different.",30,0.9983

Each time I've been here on a Tuesday around noon and I felt like I had the store to myself each time. They do not take appointments which is nice because you can just pop in anytime and try on dresses. I never felt rushed by my consultant Nadine. She was patient and kind. I didn't feel pressured and the environment was relaxed unlike some of the more commercialized stores. They carry many of the same dresses as Kleinfeld. I've visited several bridal stores over the past few months just to see the kind of styles I like and what looks good on me. RK Bridal kept popping up every time I searched for places. I finally visited. The showroom in midtown is absolutely beautiful. My favorite part about RK Bridal is that you can set up an account online and look at all of the different dresses they have by designer and save the ones you like. By the time I got to the store I had a list of the item numbers I wanted to try. This expedites and facilitates the process. You will be assigned a consultant when you arrive. Each time I went I was in the fitting room within 20 minutes more/less. They have TV screens where you can test how you will look on camera with your dress :) nice touch! On my last visit I tried on many dresses and finally found the one!! My sister, mom and soon to be mother-in-law were with me and I said yes to the dress! They have hundreds of dresses organized by designer. They carry reputable designers (Justin Alexander, Maggie Sottero, Watters & Watters, etc..). I've had a great experience so far. My dress should arrive within 3-4 months and they will store it for me until the wedding. In regards to payment, you pay deposit (half of the cost) on the day you pick your dress. The rest is to be paid at the ""try-on"" appointment when the dress arrives. Good luck and I highly recommend visiting RK Bridal on a weekday. Avoid the weekends and you should be fine :) lots of beautiful options!",29,0.9958

What we got:- Hummus with fava beans (guest chef menu)- Salatim (guest chef menu)- Oysters on the half shell (regular menu)- Smoked sable toad in a hole (guest chef menu)- Fluke crudo (regular menu)- green bean blini (regular menu)- Short rib with fried cauliflower and rice (guest chef menu)My favorites were the hummus (duh), the smoked sable with egg in the hole, the oysters, and the short rib. The hummus was super velvety as usual, just like at Dizengoff. The smoked sable was a very unique texture, and the runny egg on top was just great. The oysters had a really clean, creamy finish, which I really enjoyed. The short rib, while not a large portion, definitely had a great texture, and the fried cauliflower was a great accompaniment. Service was very attentive and friendly, and gave us great recommendations. We both were very pleased with the wine that we got, and just felt very comfortable. The prices are a bit on the expensive side, especially for a cafe-type setting, but the food was well-plated and executed, so at least you know you're getting a great meal.Definitely a great place to have a meal after touring the Whitney museum. I would definitely come back to try their rotating menus for date night, or even a small group.",90,0.9915
356,16,8,4.0,"Summary: A must try if you've never been to a crawfish place in New Orleans or in China. Find a bar nearby for the wait. 4 or less people is better. 1 star off for baby crawfish and limited dessert menu, but a top pick on my crustacean list.Note: Bring Cash or an ATM card. No credit cards. Atmosphere: It looks like the NY version of a crawfish boil place. You have your gloves, buckets, and simple furnishings, but more stylish LES chic vs. my experience in the South, and also a lot more diverse (because who doesn't love seafood). Even with the chicness of the crowd, people aren't afraid to get their grub on with bib to catch any droppings. Totally my kind of people. If thinking to bring friends who have not tried a crawfish boil, this is likely the most attractive version.Service: Very professional and focused. The space is tight and there is so much to navigate. No reservations, but they have a high end system that will call you with a 15min warning when your table is ready. There are a ton of nearby bars. The perfect set-up is to go put your name in, have your friends meet at the bar and then head over. Mommy always says flakey friends - while fun - hold you back; and here she's right. You have to have your party count down, as you get seated only once everyone is there and there is no adding seats after the fact. Save flakey for a different spot.They have bus staff and wait staff ready to sort you out as soon as you seat. Be prepared to sort out what you want ASAP. They come back regularly and the food comes quick, but this is one of those places with the vibe where you want to just order.The Food: There really are some instructions for ordering at The Boil:2lbs of the same ""order type"" is better than 1 lb because it gets you corn and potatoes. I was hungry and 1.5 lbs plus aps was good. We had 3lbs of meat at the table and that served 3 of us plus appetizer. According to the internet, 4lbs is normal and 7lbs is for Cajun locals.Sauces: You really should just get ""The Boil"", but they have ""The Boil"" sauce components separately, i.e. Garlic and butter Ole' Bay and lime. We tried The Boil sauce and The Boil sauce minus the butter. All very awesome. It would be wrong to go sauceless. Just wrong. As for spicey, we went Spicey. I think Medium might have been better for some in our group. I eat sirachi by the spoonful and did feel spicey required a bit more water drinking than I would have liked. Really spicey is for people is for those trying to prove a point while eating. I would avoid that unless this is your deal.Sauce Delivery Mechanisms:Crawfish & Shrimp: Currently $13/lb. These are two great budget choices and will deliver that amazing sauce right to your palate. For those familiar with Crawfish, these are the tiniest I have ever seen. Some, with head, are smaller than a medium size shrimp. (Note: A crawfish grows to 4-6 inches, the size of a tiger shrimp, not 1 inch) Minus 1/2 a star. The sauce is so great though, I got over this crawfish infantaside and sucked down that head like a champ. Plus, it's almost like soft shelled crawfish at that point. Potato and Corn - These are soaked in the same sauce and are absolutely delicious. Get the 2 lbs and order more to toss in.Crab - Crab meat is sweeter than Crawfish, shrimp or lobstar and that, my friends, is why the Crab is so awesome it gets its own astrological sign. Order it.Catfish appetizer - This is perfectly cooked, with flakey white meat and delicious freshly fried breading. You can tell they are being good about changing out that oil regularly. The fries are drenched in ole bay seasoning yummy goodness.Desert choices are two flan like items. They're good. But seriously, here's a note to management. Get some better desserts. Think cold pies like Key Lime or Chocolate Meringue or some Truffle like yumminess. I mean, if your clientele just sucked down a pound of butter and yummy cholesterol filled meat, they are also totally game for some delicious calorie filled dessert to top it off. Minus 1/2 a point.",33,0.9993
357,26,12,4.0,"Ah, the comfort of familiarity. When I visited Carroll Place on Monday night, I had never entered the space before. Yet I felt like I had, without knowing why. But the why became pretty clear upon my first scan of the menu. The organization, the font, the menu offerings--serious deja vu going on. And then it hit me: I had recently eaten at one of my very favorite Italian spots on the Upper West Side, Osteria Cotta. I've been to Cotta six or seven times at this point so am--you guessed--familiar with the menu. This is a really long-winded way of saying that Carroll Place is in fact Cotta's sister restaurant and my visit here can only be described as serendipity (though if I'm being totally honest, I like Cotta better!). Both well-priced, both a great time.Like Cotta, the interior is beautiful--but in a different way. Whereas Cotta feels cozier and intimate, Carroll Place is more spacious and social. Majestically high ceilings with beautiful lighting fixtures, an expansive bar area, Beauty and the Beast level candles, etc. And that's just in the front space. The back is more of what you'd typically find in a sit-down restaurant--brighter lighting, smaller tables and quieter than the more gastropub-esque setting in front. I'm also pretty sure there's seating on the balcony--another Cotta feature. Overall, while this could be considered a date spot, I'd say it's suitable for any type of occasion. Carroll Place is a wine bar above all else. They do offer a number of beer and cocktails, but upon looking at the menu here it's pretty clear that wine is the specialty. That said, we actually started with cocktails first. I wasn't feeling wine (initially). We each got a different cocktail so I had the wonderful opportunity to try three drinks: the Bontempo (gin, fragoli wild strawberry liquor, lemon, mint, cava rose), the Bleeker Street Sour (rye, amaretto, lemon, egg white, angostura montepulciano float) and the Ginger Derby (bourbon, ginger liqueur, grapefruit, honey syrup). These drinks looked a lot better on paper than they actually were. Of the three, the Bontempo was my favorite and the Ginger Derby, my least favorite. And as luck would have it, that was my drink. Oh well. Onto the wine......so Carroll place offers the glorious deal of half-off bottles of wine on Monday nights. Because who goes out drinking on a Monday? The answer is us. We do. So we ordered a bottle of Rioja ($26 w/ the deal) and it was absolutely fantastic. Do this. Just stick with wine unless you're really not a wine person. It's worth it. I do have to mention here that one thing that really soured our experience here was the service. Our waitress was MIA most of the time. Which was odd, because she kept butting in on our conversations (at least we know she is adamantly anti-Trump) unannounced. I would've been able to put up for that if not for the spotty attention otherwise. But let's get to the good. 4 for $11 Bruschetta: mascarpone & clover honey, buratta & red pepper, ricotta & basil pesto, caponata & goat cheese: AOther than the menu's template and font, this helped solidify my conviction that the similarities between Carroll Place and Cotta were more than just coincidence. And like Cotta, Carroll Places offers a superb deal on bruschetta that I'd recommend to anyone--with the exception of those intolerant of lactose. Each taste of bruschetta here is rich and luxurious (try to read this in a non-redundant way). I could honestly eat this for desert. The mascarpone and honey is slightly sweet, fluffy and heavenly. And seriously addicting. I adore buratta so my enjoyment of that one was no surprise. And who doesn't love pesto (other than those allergic to tree nuts--I just know many people with allergies so this apparently comes up a lot)? Hard to go wrong here--and these were a hit with everyone. Two orders of 2 for $11 Market Sides: A- overall-Broccoli rabe -Brussels sprouts w/ pancetta -Butternut squash -Asparagus w/ parmesanI'm just going to lump all of our sides into one paragraph because none of them were particularly bad, nor exceptional. They're sides at a wine bar so let's keep our expectations reasonable, shall we? The broccoli rabe was meh and probably my least favorite of the bunch. I had just eaten some bomb broccoli rabe at Ladybird a few days prior, so this one paled in comparison. The asparagus and parm was seriously tasty though. Not the healthiest preparation but it really hit the spot. The brussels sprouts were also incredibly tasty. Cooked perfectly and pairing them with pancetta typically Wood fired rosemary wings: B+/A-Also little to say about these. The rosemary was dope, the wood-fired, not so much. Trust me, I always prefer my chicken to be cooked cautiously (i.e. overcooked). But the dryness of these took away from the flavor, which was yummy. I'd honestly still recommend these because done right, these are a crowd favorite. Possible that this was just an off night.",28,0.9986
358,25,18,4.0,"Looking to adopt or just admire, nap, play with the kitties, Koneko is a worthwhile visit. I made a reservation quite easily online, for $15 per person for one hour. Bonus, it is okay to snack in the cat nap room while playing with the cats, if you choose to do so. Photos allowed, but no flash photography of course.I did not try the food or drink at Koneko, but specifically went to see the cats. A reservation for 2 ppl on a Sunday was easily arranged a few days before. The cats are immensely adorable, and any cat lover will have a great time. The cat nap rooms include two floors, each with a small room filled with some cat toys and napping beds and shelves for climbing. By 4PM, most of the cats were burned out and sleeping. I would suggest trying to go earlier in the day as the cats will be possibly more awake and active. Still, it was a nice time just lounging around with and petting the cats. They were super well behaved and tame for the most part and did not mind the constant flow of a stranger's company. The cats are really adorable, and we both had a great time just seeing the variety. They had about 15 cats for that evening.We really enjoyed our time at Koneko. Their cats are lovely, the cafe itself is cute. I would come back and try some of their coffee and/or small bites. Otherwise I would agree the main attraction are the cats. You can spend only $15 to spend time in the cat nap room for one hour, or take a peek when passing through. Otherwise, worthwhile visit for any cat lover out there.",28,0.998
359,28,19,4.0,"I honestly wasn't sure what to expect but my boyfriend swore their burgers were amazing and I am going to have to agree! The best part, it came with tater tots. One of my ultimate weaknesses. The bar/restaurant isn't huge but there's plenty of bar space as well as tables all along the restaurant. I started off with their herbalicious mojito and it was freaken good, made with a load of cilantro. It was super flavorful from the mounds of fresh cilantro they used, coupled with sweet and acid from the mojito blend they did. It was really good and the presentation on its own was beautiful.As for the Daddy-O burger, yum yum yum. Ultra juicy from the brisket blend, huge in size. The patty was the perfect size for the gigantic sesame seed buns. Coupled with simple lettuce, tomatoes, onions, ketchup and mayo. Everything held together well. It was the perfect burger. The tater tots were just as good, freshly made with a great crunch on the outside. Overall, a great pick for just hanging out and eating some good simple food.

We did a nearby search on Yelp and decided to check out Foragers Table. It turned out to be a great choice!The restaurant was buzzing around 11:00 AM, which I can imagine is a common theme. We had to wait about 15 minutes for some seats at the bar, which wasn't bad considering we perused their market to pass the time. Regardless, I would recommend making a reservation if you get the chance.The restaurant is quaint, featuring table service and bar seating where you can watch the meals being prepared. Service was very friendly, and we appreciated the helpful walkthrough of the food menu. The atmosphere was casual with a trendy twist, which we thought was nice.The food tasted fresh thanks to the farm-to-table concept. We shared a peach scone to begin our meal, and it was wonderful. I ordered the whole wheat wrap and my better half tried the chili. The wrap contained scrambled eggs, steak, and cheddar, while the chili included a runny egg on top and cornbread on the bottom.

When: I came here before a show around 5:45. We asked for them to speed up the order to make a show and they brought everything out very quickly. Where: Smack center of where Broadway shows are playing. The outside of this building is disguised as a vintage antique store, covered in vines. Very easy to miss. Why: Lets face it- New Yorkers will do anything they can to avoid this area and being around aggressive street performers and burnt out tourist families.

365,17,13,4.0,"By some stroke of luck, Mr. Joy managed to get a same-day reservation. I knew this place was generating serious hype, but I wasn't expecting it to be THIS cramped... or THIS small. Oh NYC, this city's capitalist dreams overrides any concerns over space issues... unless of course, the fire department happens to intervene. To squeeze us in, the hostess had to pull the small table all the way out towards the doorway, and asked which one of us would like to be trapped in the corner. ('Trapped' is me loosely interpreting the situation.) Given my small frame and the fact that I am vertically challenged, obviously I said I would sit there. To give more color, the space is more suited for a takeout sandwich counter than a trendy cheese & charcuterie restaurant with waiter service. Actually, you can purchase takeout, but only their sandwiches. Raclettes are only for those who dine in, so you can enjoy it hot and fresh. Otherwise, the cheese would seize up and become tough. Aside from lack of space, it is also very, very warm in here. Luckily, we had the good fortune to eat here when it was still about 70 degrees outside, but I don't think I could handle it during a heat wave. First of all, it's hot because it needs to be. The wheels of cheese need to be heated under heat lamps. Secondly, there is no AC or fans. Thirdly, they don't serve ice. Our water glasses were nearly warm. An elderly lady asked for ice for her water and the waitress apologized and said they don't have ice.I don't blame any of the staff. They're doing their best to accommodate the guests and it shows. I don't intend to complain, but anyone that plans to eat here should be aware that you need to be okay with the idea of being somewhat uncomfortable. In fact, I'll have to take away a star for the level of discomfort.As for the food, it was delicious! The Raclette comes with cured meats, and you can choose from Viande sechee (dried beef), Prosciutto di Parma, Jambon de Paris. We opted for the Jambon de Paris. It ended up being not as good as the prosciutto, but it was good to try considering our tartine already had prosciutto. $15 Savoyarde Raclette - melted & scraped tableside; roasted potatoes, cornichons, pickled white pearl onions, sliced baguette, arugula salad w/ champagne vinaigrette:Glancing around our table, I wasn't sure how the server would even have room to scrape the raclette tableside. We were shoulder to shoulder with the people next to us. Our server actually managed very well by positioning herself over Mr. Joy's shoulder. The beautiful, gooey cheese plopped down over the roasted potatoes. They step away for a few minutes before providing you with a second scraping of cheese. It was hot and stringy with a mild, nutty flavor. It's best if you eat a little bit of everything together - some cheese, a little ham, and arugula on top of the baguette. I also really like cornichons and pearl onions, but I would have liked it more if they had left the pearl onions sweet instead of pickled, since there was plenty of acid from the cornichons. It's also a good idea to eat quickly, because the cheese cools and can solidify & toughen pretty quickly.$12.40 Fig Tartine - Brillat savarin, figs, prosciutto, toasted hazelnuts, mache, balsamic reduction on toasted baguette:Not only did this tartine taste amazing, but I also appreciated the work that went into it. It looks like slices of prosciutto were rolled up, sliced, and meticulously positioned with the figs onto the baguette. It was an excellent balance of salty and sweet with plenty of prosciutto. The baguette was also toasted perfectly, just nice and crunchy.I might have enjoyed the tartine more than I did the raclette.Afterwards, I was once again reminded of the lack of space in here. The hostess was busy taking a phone order, so Mr. Joy maneuvered the table, so that I could maneuver myself out of the restaurant. I raised my eyebrows when I overheard the waitresses say they were prepping a table for a party of 7. (o.O) ??? Um, yeah, this place ain't right for groups.I'm curious to try their Havana Croque in the future, but I'd definitely order it to go. Now that I've tried their raclettes, I wouldn't go through the trouble of trying to book a reservation or waiting for a table again, but it is worth a try. I hope their success allows them to obtain a larger space more suitable for their operations.",20,0.9993
366,34,16,4.0,"My family and I love Vietnamese cuisine. We were in the city today, heading home and I was in the mood for a fish sandwich. I found Vietnaam; the reviews and food pics looked amazeballs, especially the sole banh mì. When we arrived, we found street parking fairly quickly and right down the block, the place was pretty empty and we just made it because there was a downpour soon after being seated. They offer outdoor seating but we declined due to the impending weather. We ordered quite a few items because I love trying EVERYTHING...ok, calming down. We started with Flank Steak Summer Rolls and Garlic Chive Shrimp Moon Dumplings. Both dishes were really good. The dumplings tasted so good and the rolls were huge. The accompanying sauces were very tasty as well. They have Vietnamese coffee, both hot and iced, which tasted very nice. I love the coffee. It's so much better than the swill they sling in Dunkin Donuts. I ordered a Ginger Iced Tea but it's sweetened already and I just couldn't deal. I like my teas unsweetened. We also asked for a cold sake. There's only one size but it was a nice reprieve from the tea. Hubby ordered Beef Bun Xao, a very flavourful noodle dish that filled him up. My son got a Roast Pork Shoulder Banh Mì and I ordered their Classic Filet of Sole Banh Mì. I also ordered the Duck Fried Rice and Boneless Chicken Thigh Banh Mì. Everything tasted very good. The Banh Mì are great, although I feel like there could have been a bit more meat. The bread was nice and crusty on the outside but still soft. Some places where we've had those sandwiches serve them on really hard bread that ends up cutting my gums and the roof of my mouth. The sole was moist, with a perfectly browned breaded coating. I threw some jalapeños on that bad boy and ate half. I polished off some of the chicken banh mì as well. It was super juicy with a smoky, charred flavor, like they grilled it; it smelled and tasted divine. Lastly, the duck fried rice was great! It had a nice ducky flavour without being gamey but it definitely could have used a couple of squeezes of fresh lime juice. Everything we ordered was good. No complaints about the food. The portions are big and enough to share and try a few things for variety. We had plenty of food to take home. The service was excellent.

Enter Liev, stage left and it was hard to keep your eyes off of the man we have all come to expect such great talent from. Janet McTeer was witty and a delight to watch, almost prancing, about the stage. The supporting cast also held their own. It was my personal thrill to see Ora Jones cast as Madame de Volanges, and Birgitte Sorenson (from Pitch Perfect 2) was somehow able to make Madame de Tourvel a likeable character.The play itself was moved along with unexpected humor, but as true drama was able to captivate the audience with dark silences and brooding moments of expectation. I walked in wanting to like this play and found myself enjoying it despite its excesses in length. Whoever said all seats lead to favorable views told a small fib. Front and center or mezzanine center works best for this play. Despite this, I rather enjoyed the glimpses into the potential side rooms from my view up in the right mezzanine.That particular night, sometimes the accents injured the plot but by the time the intermission rolled around all was well. Bravo to Tom Scutt for wonderful costume and set designs along with very detailed and precise costume and jewelry accents. As for most Broadway plays, having a slight familiarity with the plot made the production much more enjoyable. The flaws were greatly overcast by the successes and I definitely recommend taking a gander at this play of subtle repartee.",27,0.9968

Coming from friends who are bar regulars at One on One (they do sit outside though.), I wasn't expecting much.I was actually shocked at how cute Bua was, with its wooded Portland Oregon Pub interior, and bar menu that looked enticing. The place had a certain non urban newer hominess about it, sans a few NYC denizen behaviours - A. 2 separate people with laptops each occupying the entire 4 top patio tables, with not an ounce of guilt, andB. 3 young woman holding a banal conversation at mega plus decibels that was impossible not to be immersed in. The sound of their voices were so loud it hurt. Well, cie la vie right?  Live and let live I suppose. Although eventually they left, and the bright light shone - $15 wine carafes for happy hour. I picked the Côte de Rhone, was I dreaming ? Perhaps, it was sunny, and I got a table by the open air patio window.When the bartender asked me if I only wanted one glass for the carafe the idea of needing two glasses for the carafe was a concept I couldn't grasp. ""Just the carafe"". I responded out of synch.I ordered the brussel sprout salad, which actually tasted healthy, although id be more inclined to call it a kale salad with grilled brussel sprouts. And it's only $9. (That's two cokes at the MOMA cafe or 4 single razors at a LES bodega.). The salad was fresh and delightful with sliced apples. Man I went through that carafe like it was water. I would've ordered another one but I had an art opening to attend. Bua has a homey charm of a cool pub in a cool college town.  It also manages to be happily no frills but still has a conscience and serves a good product.  Bar food highlights - Brussel sprout kale salad, burger, and fried cheese curds (which sounds wonderful and gross all at once.)15 wine carafes 3-8pm.Small place with a patio.",20,0.9835
376,26,16,4.0,"An experience unlike any I've had in New York City.I've never been to a critically acclaimed restaurant in New York where no one rushes you. Forget about rushing to take away your plates or rushing to present you with a bill, accompanied by the fake ""no rush"" aside, no one bothers you at all should you be doing nothing other than just shooting the breeze with your dining companions (we were there for an hour after our meal was complete). True, there wasn't a long line of customers waiting to be seated, but even in the 10 minutes that someone was actually waiting for a table, no one even walked near our table to message us subliminally :) The whole meal felt leisurely paced as it would in the Indian subcontinent, not Manhattan.At the same time, true to a meal in the Indian subcontinent, the smell of spices permeated the air inside this small Nepali restaurant, should that bother people who like well ventilated spaces. I expect it shouldn't, because most of the diners here would have followed the reputation of Dhaulagiri Kitchen from Jackson Heights (where they were initially located), particularly after the glowing NY Times review a few years back.For those unfamiliar with the cuisine, ordering a Thali is the most efficient way to sample as much as you can. We focused instead on ordering a bunch of ""appetizers"", as they are described on the menu even if the quantity is greater than what one expects from appetizers. Two of the appetizers were more like evening snacks: Dum Aloo (potatoes with red peppers, turmeric, cumin, coriander, ginger, garlic) and Sandheko Waiwai (ramen noodles that have been fried with green pepper, onions, cilantro, scallion and served with a wedge of lime). They were both spicy, not terribly so but still my friend had some trouble managing the heat. Be warned, for some reason this was the 1st restaurant I've been to where no one warned about the spice level of the food assuming we could handle it.These (4.5 stars) snacks were followed by Sukuti beef, that seemed like beef jerky that had been stewed for a while so as to be both chewy and pliant. I liked it (4 stars), though my friend didn't rate it as highly. The dish that wasn't high on the spice index was Chicken Chow Mein, which reminded me of the way noodles are cooked in the Indian subcontinent. The heat index didn't discomfort us one bit, and the noodles were very flavorful.The only let down in the menu were the vegetable momos. Now granted the server had recommended chicken instead, but I didn't have any expectations in the first place as I just don't find momos particularly interesting as far as dumplings go: their texture is chewy, almost rubbery and there is absolutely no juice inside when you bite into them. So, texturally and taste wise I'm not a fan of momos anywhere.But, I am a fan of Dhaulagiri Kitchen. Food was boldly flavored, authentically spiced (not dumbed down, or amped up unnaturally as in Handy Nasty), and freshly prepared. I was bummed not to be able to get the doughnut looking bread, sel roti, but they'd run out of it when we got there. Our meal for two cost $40 before tips and so really wallet friendly as well. The restaurant is open late (till 2 am), so if the Murray Hill crowd is looking for a late night meal featuring a spice challenge - definitely stop by.",31,0.9932
377,27,16,4.0,"The dessert trend of late has skewed heavily towards Thai-rolled ice cream and egg waffles, so it's hard for me to clearly distinguish one new dessert shop versus another. Pink Bear, a small storefront aptly located just east of Union Square, recently opened this past summer, and has seen its fair share of acclaim.There's a lot of good things Pink Bear has going for it, including a solid offering of ice cream bases and flavors, as well as an array of (hypothetically) unlimited toppings to choose from. You have your pick of tapioca and mochi cubes, sliced strawberries and pineapples, Teddy Grahams and wafers, sprinkles and syrups... the possibilities are only limited by the space available in your ice cream bowl, as well as the balancing skills of your ice cream maker. The final price of $7 includes tax, so payment is a short and simple process. If you happen to lean more towards an Egg Waffle Ice Cream, it's only a dollar more for an equally appealing treat.On the chilly and rainy evening we stopped by, there were only a few other guests present, so were able to quickly enter, skim the menu, and place our order. There's just shy of ten or so tempting ice cream bases, including Green Tea and Strawberry (Matcha Shawty), Thai Iced Tea and Lychee (Tang Thaied), Mango and Vanilla (Mango Tango), but we opted to go with the Brewtiful Morning, which utilizes a Vietnamese Coffee base, and watched as our server worked the ice cream base into a thin sheet on the anti-griddle, and proceeded to roll it into six even swirls of ice cream. When it came time to select the toppings, he made sure to pause numerous times to make sure we had listed out all of our desired ingredients.Unfortunately, the space at Pink Bear isn't large; the counter seats near the entrance can only accommodate four people, and a small bench against the wall can seat two people as well. In the summer, this isn't much of an issue as most people can take their treats to go, or even eat outside, but I imagine it'll be an inconvenience once the weather makes a sharp turn downwards in the colder months. Nonetheless, it's a friendly environment that provides plenty to see (although the constant making of ice cream can get noisy), and the staff were kind enough to let us try a few test flavors they were making, including an avocado-pistachio, which will hopefully make its way on the menu soon.If you happen to be in the area and looking for something to satisfy your sweet tooth, Pink Bear is well-worth a visit. Given the less-than-average wait and the fact that there is no minimum on card, it makes it even more difficult to turn down.",33,0.9787

The inside of the restaurant is very spacious, they have a full bar as well as happy hour specials (50 cent wings and $5 drinks), TVs everywhere which is definitely a plus, the music and ambiance were also great! The service was also very attentive and friendly. We ordered the sweet/sour and Hennessey wings to start, they were both good but I preferred the sweet/sour. For our main course we had fried shrimp with mac & cheese and candied yams, along with the fried catfish with greens and potato salad. The food came out rather quickly and was delicious. I was actually impressed. For dessert we had the banana pudding and that was amazing too!

The food here may not be authentic Korean mamma quality, despite the name, but if you don't know one, and want fast, convenient food you can eat in or take out, you can avail yourself of the wide range of food here. There are prepackaged foods, from cold pickles, to soups, to rice to entrees to choose from. The salad and hot food buffet serves many of the same food in the packages, though you can pick and choose what you want and have fun trying foods you've never tasted. Arshi K. was indeed correct in stating there are many vegetarian options, a bonus. Everything usually looks fresh, and mostly is, probably due in part to the high turnover. I been here numerous times and have never had a bad meal here. My fish the other day was actually tender and moist, which if you know grilled mackerel isn't always an easy feat. Eat in paper containers are free, take out plastic ones will cost you. Water is free. There are tables for eat in, though at busy hours they might enforce the time limit they state. It's not a place for lingering anyway, too much traffic, too much noise. My favorite here is the fresh squid salad in chili sauce, with enough garlic to scare Dracula into converting to Christianity. I also like the jap chae, the futomaki, and the tofu stew over the kimchi fried rice. This place was a staple when I went to school close by. It's a fun place to eat, because of all the variety here.

It is like a speakeasy meets haunted mansion. I want to live there.My date and I arrived around 7:30pm to a nearly empty bar. We were told to sit wherever and the decision was basically between a bunch of options where there are two chairs and a coffee table. I think it is similar to Madam Puddifoot's in Harry Potter--aka where Harry and Cho Chang go on their date and Cho cries into her cup of coffee because she misses Cedric and Roger Davies also asked her out, btw. What I mean by this comparison is that The Auction House was clearly designed for couples. But what's weird is that the chairs are mostly side-by-side. I just met this guy, I am trying to look at his face, not hold his hand. We sat in a corner, on what can best be described as two thrones. This chair I was sitting in made me feel so regal, so elegant, so....tiny (that's a good thing). Kind of in-theme, my date and I discussed all the normal things: jobs, families, cannibalism.

For October 2016 it was Caramelized Banana and Dulce de Leche. The cronut itself was a little disappointing. It wasn't as flaky and fluffy as I was expecting, perhaps because it was supposed to be donut and croissant it had to be a little doughy. It almost tasted like a slightly stale croissant. I also wasn't expecting there to be cream/filling in between some of the layers.  Overall, it was good but not mind blowing.DKA - this was amazing.

The service is always good for tea. The pastry are always very nice compliment to a good cup. I was here a month ago with my ex and here mom for tea and it was very nice.

I eat everywhere and drink everywhere. Normally I order 18yr old. It's cheaper in other places just as nice if not nicer on the UES. The $25 for my cousins drink was normal price usually specialty cocktails cost anywhere from $19-26 a drink. Granted. The drinks are fantastic. The food we got I also thought was expensive.

The entire bar, however, was nearly reserved, but luckily with two free seats available. If anything, you will want to sit at the bar if you can because part of the enjoyment will come from watching them at work, creating really what are works of delicious art. They prepare these with such precision and care but with an apparent level of expertise. Certainly a pleasure to watch.There is the option of a pre-fixe ($16), which is what we each had ordered. This includes Amuse bouche, choice of dessert, and Petits Fours. Wine pairing is $9 additional, but I didn't opt for this. For dessert, we chose the Fromage Blanc Island ""Cheese Cake"" and Warm Chocolate Tartwith Pink Peppercorn Ice Cream and Red Wine Sauce. I definitely recommend the Fromage Blanc. It is their signature dessert, with a unique preparation, presentation and wonderful flavor. The Warm Chocolate Tart is a great dish for those who particularly like chocolate desserts. I really enjoyed the peppercorn ice cream. The red wine sauce was a nice touch.ChikaLicious desserts are super unique. Off the menu, it might sound ordinary, but it really goes beyond that. If you want a cute spot that offers simple, yet experimental desserts, try ChikaLicious. This spot is great for the serious sweet tooth looking for something good yet reasonably priced to indulge in.

Duh, but only at HH, because I live for fried chicken...especially these Korean Fried Chicken Wangs.

I waited on a line that snaked and turned. I managed to purchase some focaccia. Dang it, I know where I am going to feed my bread addiction. I work upstairs and this Eataly is just too close. I am mad that it is so accessible now to feed my bread addiction. There are all kinds of carb here. The bread with fig in it was pretty tasty. I was so tempted to get a loaf but I think next time will be better since I got two slices of focaccia already....I mean....it's like an alcoholic living next to the liquor store or bar, woe-is-me.I admit it, it's super fun in here, albeit expensive. There is some seating but for the amount of people that come through, there is not a lot of seating unless you go to one of the sit down restaurants. There are some take out stations, like at a food court but much more upscale.The layout at 4 WTC feels better than the layout at the other Eataly in the Flatiron District. The location at the Flatiron district is a little too chaotic for me. Like their Flatiron location, they do not want you to hang out too long unless you are at one of their sit-down restaurants.",30,0.9782

The Pumpernickel bread was a bit salty- Salmon was good.My favorite was the Spiced Chicken TartletMiniature dates & Babaganoush Crepe was creamyMiddle tier had the scones and buttered cookies. Like using both the Lemon Curd and Devonshire Cream.Bottom tier had pastries-blueberry & raspberry tarts, macaroons, and chocolate madelines just to name a few.It was a hidden oasis for the time spent here.

Luckily, when I went, they had a truffle pizza special. Oh my god, I actually thought I was having an orgasm while I consumed each cheesy, crispy, truffly bite. This should totally be a regular menu item. While the clam pizza was very good, I didn't find it destination worthy. The rigatoni was pretty disappointing. The meat was tasty, but the pasta itself was not worth consuming. Like Charlie Bird, the wine selection is excellent. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and helped us select something that paired perfectly with our food and was exactly what we were looking for.The space is a bit cramped but the decor is welcoming.

I love Starbucks but I love to support a local coffee shop in my neighborhood as well. Plus I feel like local coffee shops care more about the most important component of coffee....ESPRESSO and minus all the bells and whistles of a millions sweet syrups. This morning I was on my IG feed and saw a post mentioning they are open and serving breakfast. I decided to make it a mission to include them in my day. They are right at the corner of 135 and 7th ave and next door to the IHOP. The storefront has a very inviting appearance and the barista def greets you with a smile and a warm welcome. While waiting for the gentleman I peeping the scene in terms of food. The selection is very limited and I was looking for breakfast items they mentioned on IG but maybe I was expecting too much. In their display of food they had coffee bread , croissants, egg salad sandwich, turkey sandwich, and a pesto mozzarella sandwich. They do have the ability to heat all of these items which is awesome. The setup is pretty nice in which they have a large community table in the back and a couple benches for you to sit and enjoy your caffeine. Their hours are 7 days a week 7:30am-6pm, but I wish they were open a little earlier for those who want a cup of joe on our way to work.Anywho the final test was the coffee obviously and I ordered a mocha with soy milk.

406,22,15,4.0,"When I first moved to NYC, I went to restaurants with the mentality of ordering the fattiest thing on the menu - fries instead of salad, nachos all the time, bacon cheeseburgers, burritos with extra guac. Unfortunately, combining that with a desk job and an unavoidable aversion to the gym left me feeling like I needed a wheelbarrow and a manservant to get around. Which brings me to kale salads. Kefi's in particular. I used to be the world's biggest kale hater, even going so far as to fish out the bits of kale with a spoon whenever someone offered me a kale-fruit smoothie (which I've come around to), but I couldn't deny that eating a kale salad makes me more functional than chowing down on a burrito the size of a small baby. I think this is what adulthood (or becoming vastly more boring) means. But Kefi's kale salad is a glorious pile of greens, topped with small chunks of feta, watermelon (!), and walnuts. Not exactly super filling but that's what the small bin of complimentary bread ...And baklava are for. It's $9.75 so not exactly cheap but you do get a hefty triangle of multiple phyllo layers soaked in honey and studded with nuts. I thought it was a bit too syrupy-sweet but my cousin loved it. I also tried a little bit of the sheep's milk dumplings, and understood the hype as soon as I took my first bite - fluffy and warm and pairs perfectly with the slightly spicy sausage. The pasta portions are a little small, which is why they recommend adding a side. Broccoli rabe was just okay. When we asked if he could take our photo, the waiter kindly took several (and they all turned out not awkward at all). NEXT TIME: shrimp orzo, bronzino, Kefi salad",29,0.9824

In this case, absolutely!The location is great for people who are trying to avoid ""touristland"" aka Time Square. Although my friend did want to walk the main strip of this hellish area, she didn't want to deal with the frantic buzz while just trying to have a cup of tea and pastry.

409,28,13,4.0,"I visited Rebelle's sister restaurant, Pearl & Ash, several years ago and despite the time and the myriad of dishes in-between, I still recall it as one of the most successful and memorable ""small plates""-format meals I've had. When Rebelle opened shortly afterwards, I was (unsurprisingly) more than happy to join a few friends here for dinner. Similar to Pearl & Ash, the restaurant has a sleek yet comforting feel to it; the spacious bar makes it a perfect place for an impromptu drink and the dining area is both welcoming and simplistic. The menu is split into four sections that follow the suggested progression from lightest to heaviest of the savory courses, followed by dessert. It's simply a suggestion, however, so feel free to mix and match between courses. I started with the Lamb Tartare, a dish that balanced the gaminess of the protein with just the right amount of acidity and richness. A dotting of green chickpeas for extra brightness and crunch, the hidden espelette for spice, and the blend of olives and yogurt rounded out the Mediterranean flavors in each bite. It's served with a few slices grilled bread drizzled with olive oil, but make sure to ask for a second order of it in order to make the most out of the dish. Also worth noting is one of their most beautiful plates, the Scallop. Two perfectly seared portions of scallop are served with sliced turnips and apples, plated over a fragrant ""green juice"" and finished with fresh dill. It's, perhaps, a little gimmicky, but the flavors are both light and crisp, and the slight sweetness from the apple complements the scallop perfectly. The few bites from the Fluke and the Halibut that I stole were similarly delicious, and made me regret not ordering my own dish.For the wine lovers and connoisseurs, Rebelle has a top-notch wine program (thanks to their acclaimed wine director, Patrick Cappiello), so you'll be sure to find a selection to suit your tastes. I'm happy to also note that Rebelle was awarded one Michelin star shortly after their opening, and while I personally found the dishes at Pearl & Ash to be more successful, I can say that a dining experience at Rebelle won't disappoint either.",33,0.9975

412,21,52,4.0,"WARNING!! you need to be in at least decent shape before you attempt this class. As in you exercise regularly and can handle 50 min of nonstop strenuous exercise such as other boot camps (at least..)I don't normally review exercise workouts, but I am making an exception for Tone House because it is that insane and I want put an additional word out there that this is definitely not for the faint of heart. As many people have said, this is a level of its own. As close to torture I will probably ever get...maybe even worse than childbirth...not that I would know at this point. I consider myself a regular class pass-er now and in order to prepare myself for my first session, I went to Barry's and Warrior Boot Camp. Although Barry's and Warrior's were extremely intense in their own way, there were modifications to the exercises that you could do and you could rest at your own pace. So they gave a semblance that everything is within reach. Here at Tone House, it is do or die. There is no giving up...and I don't know if at some point I was actually seeing red or the color was coming from the lit room. The lightning speed at which we were expected to move made me want to give up every step of the way as I was still catching my breath from the warmup...oh god the warmup. I read that the warm-up was bad and I braced myself in the beginning..but I couldn't brace myself for the fact that for the entire rest of the session I felt like I was holding up the team....While I rested...I watched those with extremely defined muscles move like animals on a hunt..it was insane...animals I tell you. Tamara (my instructor for the class) refused to let any of us cheat and for the whole entire time motivated us to perform at full level. Even after reading countless reviews, I don't think anything can prepare you for the beast that is Tone House that it will eat you alive. I did not feel the intimidation of the class until I saw what we were supposed to do next..then again..then another set..all in the flash of an eye. I was always the last to finish, which I expected. I wouldn't feel so bad if I didn't feel like I was holding the class up...I did feel good that I was able to accomplish most (ok half..maybe a third) of all the exercises but I feel like I was just in shock because I was just trying to catch up the entire time. Personally for me, I did not feel like the class got any easier and I don't like to give up....but obviously I was not in good enough shape. I never ran a marathon (let alone half marathon) and I don't go to bootcamp/HIIT classes regularly. Like I go to the girly girl classes like Chaise and maybe an occasional kickboxing class. Also I had a bagel with cream cheese that morning from Russ and Daughters.....It was the closest I felt like throwing up from any of my classpass classes...and there was that heckling cough that came afterwards that a lot of the other reviewers mentioned..my body was just in shock. All in all, I don't think I will be back until I am in dramatically better shape and mentally prepared again to handle this level of torture. For those military style fitness fanatics out there that are seeking for more than your average personal training session, I highly recommend this place. This is definitely an unforgettable experience to say the least...Even a day later, I think my brain is still in the process of catching up to what happened to my body.",54,0.9799

Meat taste better cut think, that is obviously, if the quality of meat is solid. It is also one of my husband's favorite Japanese foods, so I got one for him.This sandwich was tightly sealed in a plastic wrap, and naturally I worried. The sandwich might had gotten soggy, and it was. But seeing the traditionally thick-cut meat that were sandwiched between soft-chewy Japanese white bread, relieved me. But after one bite, I noticed something I was not used to...but I kept eating. It was the sauce. Instead of thick sweet Tonkatsu sauce, it was a house special sauce, a mixture of Japanese BBQ sauce and miso. Miso created unique saltiness to the sauce. After I finished half of soggy sandwich, I was unstoppable and made me want to go back for more. The location is tricky as most mentioned here. Think you are going into the high rise office building with doormen. The lobby is covered by white marble(?), like a gallery. The tiny store is located way back by the elevators on the grand floor.

We made an easy reservation for Friday at 745 for 4. And were seated in the front. I'd been upstairs before for a meeting and must say sitting upstairs is definitely most impressive. The restaurant is pretty big. We started off with a bottle of rose - I forget the name of it per se but it was definitely of the Greek variety (they're having a rose month so lots of selection- overall there are a ton of wines to choose), it started with an L and was medium bodied.. Lokonikto? Honestly, something like that. Our service was great, very prompt, polite, attentive, gave good recommendations and was good with water refill and communicative.For dinner we shared the grilled octopus (very tasty, well cooked), and farro salad (simple, tasty ingredients). Two of us (myself included) had the famed chicken under a brick- tasty seared chicken breast and leg under pita crackers and Greeks salad (cucumber, olives, etc). My friend had the deep fried rabbit which was not my thing; it was fried well but had a sweet ihs/spicy taste which I didn't love. My fiance had the whole brook trout which was a $42 special and probably the most delicious thing I tried all night - perfectly cooked, tender, juicy with lemon, very healthy and fresh. He ordered a side of delicious roasted broccoli... the dishes are sort of steakhouse style where you get your main meal and have to order sides if you want.For dessert we shared the special cherry pie which I am not sure was made in house but still good (it was a perfect looking tart) -came with some good ice cream, forget the flavor but it was kind of periwinkle in color.They do also have good after dinner coffee- inclusive of a $12 French Press batch for the table.While the food is expensive, it's finer dining NYC prices (high 20s, low 30s) I do think portion sizes are fair.

The platter did not come with bread. We asked for bread and they brought us a lightly toasted baguette from the bakery. My cousin had a apple tart.

424,19,11,4.0,"I was lucky to be able to finally try Morimoto-san's new digs - Momosan - on a random Thursday evening while some friends and I were chilling at nearby Salvation Taco. After walking by and seeing a crowd outside, I wondered what this ever so popular place was... turns out it was Momosan! I quickly had the brilliant idea of putting our group's name down at the hostess so we could wait and do happy hour at the same time. After about an hour, our group of 7 were seated (extremely, extremely tightly) into a booth. Let me just say that Momosan is NOT good for groups, especially at it's current state of popularity. I would not come here with more than 4 people.Despite our awkward seating arrangement, the waiters and hostess and chefs here were extremely welcoming and hospitable. There was always someone coming by to check how we were doing. It was also nice to see Chef Morimoto hard at work, preparing food and serving food to patrons just like any normal person.As is usual, I found the appetizers to be, well, more intriguing and appetizing than the ramen itself. To start, we got the tuna starter, which didn't really tickle my fancy all that much because it was overly marinated and you couldn't really taste the tuna. The cucumber in it reminded me of the Chinese marinated cucumber. I really enjoyed the fried pigs ear - it was fried to perfection - crispy and flavorful and well seasoned on the outside and soft and slightly cartilaginous on the inside. It didn't even need the sauce it came with. Finally, we had 3 orders (2 pc each) of the sticky ribs. I could eat a whole rack of these things - I prefer this somewhat fried, sweet and spicy version over American BBQ ribs any day. I would most definitely order this again - wish they had this as an entree! We were also presented with house-made kimchi - this kimchi, is probably my one of two of my favorite kimchi I've ever had. As for the ramen, I ordered the tonkotsu - my go to for every ramen joint, if I can. I wished they had a spicy version, but they have a chili oil/sauce that is a perfect addition to the rich soup, for those wanting a kick. At $10 a bowl, this is a ridiculous steal of a price for something with the name ""Morimoto"" attached to it and even for NYC prices. Ippudo charges at least $15 for the same thing. Though I prefer the thin straight noodles in my ramen, the curly, special Momosan/Sun Noodle noodle that doesn't go ""soggy"" were a perfect texture and not too firm or soft. I'll give them that - definitely not some Shin cup noodles for sure! The soup was not too salty, but we all decided it must be filled with MSG or something because we all left with dry mouth and craving a ton of water. The broth was rich, but not too thick, and full of flavor just like I like it. I prefer slices of char siu over the ""pulled"" version they have at Momosan. How does Momosan rank with all my other ramen joints? Probably fourth - Totto / Jun-Men / Ippudo coming before them. Regardless, this is a spot that one should try at least once - more than once might not be as appealing if you have to wait an hour every time to eat. Great job, chef Jae Lee and Morimoto!",25,0.996
425,28,11,4.0,"I have been wanting to try this dessert spot for a while - even had it bookmarked!Yesterday we just finished up at the Pier 51 Playground and wanted a sweet treat. When I checked my handy dandy Yelp app, I saw that we were 4 blocks away from Aux Merveilleux de Fred so we figured we would give it a shot.To our surprise it is a take-out only restaurant. When I asked where the seating was, I was directed to the benches outside. Totally fine, but unexpected. They served brioche and merveileux which is a cream and merengue pastry covered in shaved chocolate or nuts. The consistency is extremely light. You don't feel stuffed after eating one. We had:- iced coffee - very good- sugar brioche - very good and not too sweet- Coffee Merveilleux - excellent- Dark Chocolate Merveilleux - my kids liked this better than I did. I am not a big chocolate person- Cherry Merveilleux - delicious and not too sweet- Hazelnut Merveilleux - very good- Caramel Merveilleux - delicious- White Chocolate Merveileux - my favorite When dining in the Village or the Meat Packing District, I would definitely stop in again for these super yummy treats.",30,0.9966
426,21,12,4.0,"We kept it old school this Mother's Day and dined at Roberto's. While I've known of this restaurant for a while, I had never dined here before tonight. Roberto's is owned by chef Roberto Paciullo, who also owns Zero Otto Nove around the corner on Arthur Ave. While Zero Otto Nove is arguably more well known (he opened two more of them in Manhattan and Armonk), it all started here for Paciullo at his namesake restaurant.Like most restaurants on Arthur Ave, Roberto's is small; upon entry, there's a small foyer containing a bar with an archway that leads into the main dining area. The atmosphere is intimate with low lighting and music playing. The color scheme is warm with dark beiges, browns, and woods.The menu contains slightly elevated Italian cuisine. The bread basket contained a simple Italian loaf and a few slices of focaccia. I totally succumbed to my carb cravings as soon as it hit the table; the bread was so simple yet so amazing - being on Arthur Ave I didn't expect anything less. My app of Italian sausage with cannellini beans and broccoli rabe was super tasty - the flavors paired well and I'm always a sucker for broccoli rabe. For my main I had the pollo con spinaci which was a chicken breast with proscuitto and spinach topped with melted mozzarella in a wine sauce. The entree was fairly simple but it was tasty - the chicken was massive =O. For dessert I had the tiramisu which was good - my cappuccino was slightly bitter but it wasn't a deal breaker. Service was great, everyone was very friendly - I was especially impressed by our server who memorized the massive specials menu to a T. Roberto's is definitely a place to get the real-deal Arthur Ave Italian dining experience and clearly shows why Roberto Paciullo has been so successful in his endeavors. While I still prefer Zero Otto Nove, Roberto's doesn't disappoint.",24,0.991

With an entirely new layout, a myriad of different styles of artwork which included some rather well known names. Such a pleasant little surprise. The entryway boasts of a modern eye catching ceiling with ample room for receiving guests for any event. The sound of a jazz trio trickled into the lobby when we entered. Which drew us in to an overpacked room filled with listeners. Excellent choice, each musician clearly talented.The main exhibition explores unfinished work from a multitude of people, some subjects missing faces, while others may be waiting for a scene or a background. It brings great insight into the mind of each artist and the way their mind works, in addition to their personal process.

Still, nothing compares to my city by the bay in terms of variety and prices... It's a very narrow shop with decently spacious aisles enough for one and a half people. I'm impressed with how modern, clean and bright it is inside! Despite coming at very busy hours, the check out is always super fast.

429,34,18,4.0,"Delmonico's is one of the few places in the Financial District that's close to 5-Stars, primarily because of it's rich history.I mean, any restaurant that's been around since 1837 and was a favorite of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, JP Morgan, Charles Dickens, Napoleon III and Mark Twain, has to be on that list.I give Delmonico's only 4-Stars as the food is not up to 5-Star quality, in my opinion. I wouldn't come here just based on the food, as I think it's good, but not necessarily great. But the history definitely is great. Here's my breakdown:History: 5.0-StarsAmbiance: 4.0-StarsFood: 3.5-StarsWine: 3.0-StarsPrice: 2.5-StarsSo, the question you're probably asking, is, why would Elton be recommending this place so highly if the food is just ok? Well, here are a few facts about Delmonico's that makes it more unique than any other restaurant in the United States, and a reason why I think it deserves at least one visit.Delmonico's Is The:- First & Oldest Fine Dining Restaurant in the U.S., since 1837- First to use the French word ""Restaurant"" to describe itself- First Restaurant to use a Printed Menu- First Restaurant to use Tablecloths & Silverware- Restaurant with the Largest Wine Cellar in the U.S. at that timeIn addition, Delmonico's created/invented these dishes, which are still popular almost 200 years later:- Eggs Benedict- Manhattan Clam Chowder- Delmonico's Steak- Delmonico Potatoes- Lobster Newburg- Chicken A La King- Baked AlaskaIf you haven't had any of these dishes, I highly recommend you try them as they're all good, in my opinion. And if you get a chance to try them at Delmonico's, even better. Although, to be honest, other places have perfected these dishes, so I'm not saying Delmonico's is the best version, but it is the original.Lastly, if you're a ""foodie"" and looking to be blown away by amazing cuisine, then this is not the place for that and I can assure you that you'll be disappointed. Yes, there are better steaks in the city, yes, there are better eggs benedict, chowder, etc. at other places, and yes, the ambiance is really old school and frankly, old. But, there's no denying that Delmonico's is what started the restaurant industry here in the United Stats, and for that, I think it's worth a visit.",53,0.9967

Also, the space is pretty big so it's easy to fit large parties.Green tea shaved ice: Yum! I got this with bubbles, strawberry, condensed milk, and mochi. I'd definitely recommend this combo. The only thing is that I wish the bubbles weren't hot because it melted the shaved ice.Korean fried donut: I found this to be wayyyyy too sweet. I could only take one little bite of it. They put a lot of syrup and is overwhelming. The ice cream on the side is not very good, either. If you like very sweet stuff, you might like this.Teas: I love the way they present their tea here because they put it in a cute little tea pot with a little cup on the side.

431,30,16,4.0,"When I first went to Ramen Lab, Chef Nakamura's torigara and miso ramen were the only types of ramen there. I loved everything about those first couple of months of Ramen Lab--the tight seating...err, standing, the very scientific and simple layout of the menu, tip-inclusion, and those two outstanding types of bowls. I wanted it to last forever. Mind you, I like that Ramen Lab is now a pop-up, a place that'll host a certain chef for a couple of weeks before it moves on to the next. It's exciting and it adds to the 'lab' feel. That said, I do miss that atmosphere. When I heard that Nakamura-san opened a store in the LES with those same torigara and miso ramen bowls on the menu, I was excited! But aside from the menu and the original beaker cups, Nakamura has a different feel because it's a sit-down place. There are no counter seats. It's become slightly more glamorous. Nakamura is still experimenting with tips. Since I had loved his rich (vegan!) miso and clean torigara ramens at Ramen Lab, I decided to go for the yuzu dashi this time. The yuzu dashi was clean and refreshing, with a very strong yuzu presence. The citrus notes weren't overpowering, but I do wish I had added on an egg on the side for some added depth. The noodles were thin and I felt like the noodle to broth ratio was perfect. A large, lean slice of pork covered nearly a quarter of the bowl. He has done it again. The gyoza appetizer was also very good. The skin on each gyoza was so thin and the filling so juicy and gingery; it was somehow very flavorful without being too heavy. It came sizzling on a hot plate with the tops crisped just-so. Likelihood of another visit:I guess with a sit-down restaurant comes a more relaxed feel. It certainly makes having conversations with dining mates easier and permissible. I'm also happy to know that his menu is here to stay in a permanent space--I'll definitely be back.",26,0.9959

433,24,9,4.0,"Those who want to take a healthy lunch break should consider Green Symphony. A super tiny, independently-owned salad bar/smoothie bar/deli that packs a great selection off their menu and buffet stations. They offer a ton of natural fruit and vegetable smoothies and drinks. If you check out their full menu, they have specialty items like rice bowls (containing brown rice only), creative wraps, creative salads, and so forth. The options are simply great. They offer delivery and pick-up for your convenience. While they have their buffet stations, I just go straight to ordering off their menu. I've tried a good share of their options which includes the Sesame Tofu Steak Salad, Tofu Mania Bowl, Chicken Bowl, New Yorker Bowl, and the Dalai Lama Bowl. Their salads range about $7-10, and I think they are pretty fair price-wise. The portions are very good, and they come with plenty of the toppings that are being offered. Regarding the 'Bowls', they are simply rice bowls that come with a variety of different toppings (much like bibimbap). They strictly use brown rice for these, and none of the ingredients are fried. It's my personal favorite to order when I get lunch from here, if not the wraps. The smoothies and speciality mixed drinks packed with only healthy ingredients are also worth the try. They have an extensive smoothies menu that is probably the best I have encountered around here.Green Symphony is definitely one of my favorite hidden deli spots. Vegetarians/vegans would particularly love this spot because they offer so much in terms of non-meat options. Good, healthy and reasonably priced food does exist in Times Square, and this spot has consistently proven that on my several visits for lunch.",22,0.9967

I went back this weekend for an early (10:30) brunch on Sunday. There were some other tables, but it wasn't too crowded. It was starting to fill up more when we left around noon. I was feeling slightly hung over from the night before, so I decided I needed some hair of the dog, and ordered a bacon bloody mary. This was good, but I imagined there would be a long, crispy stick of bacon in the glass, but the bacon was crumbled up on top. It was good, but not exactly what I was expecting. I also felt like I should order something carby to absorb all the alcohol in my bloodstream, and ordered the BEC. The waitress said it wasn't that big and suggested I ordered a side. I got the rosemary tater tots! Best decision ever, but to be honest I thought the sandwich was kind of big and would have been fine without the side. The bacon was a bit thicker cut; the egg wasn't runny which was nice. My cousin took a bite out of his steak sandwich and the egg opened and dripped down his hand. Overall I thought the BEC was good, and I liked the brioche bun. I didn't taste anyone else's food, but everyone seemed to enjoy what they got. I shared my tater tots and I think everyone agreed they were amazing. I don't know why I never really think to come here, but it's definitely a good spot!

We all really enjoyed our meals except my grandpa who claimed his Russian maid cooks better food (we all found this funny considering he is a super stubborn 90 year old Russian man). We got an amuse bouche of truffle arancini which was SOOOO good that I could have eaten all of them (and considering it was my birthday it would have been nice if my family let me but that was not the case sadly). We also got three other things, one that had some kind of white fish rolled up in a cracker, another that looked like a tart but I do not remember what it was, and a cold pea soup shot. They were all good but the arancini was the best.For my appetizer course I got the kampachi crudo. It was good, not great, nor was it really memorable. My brother had the foie gras which he really enjoyed and my grandpa had the pork ravioli which was the only dish he really liked/For my vegetable course I got the hen of the woods, tofu and onion dish.It was really amazing and the mushrooms were perfectly cooked (unlike the ones I had for my previous birthday at Marea that were super chewy).For the entree I got the scallops which were the best scallops I have ever had. They were perfectly cooked and were jumbo. For dessert I had some white chocolate mousse or cake I do not really remember. It was good. They also brought a plate with macaroons and ice cream. The two things that were really memorable were the arancini (though they are not on the menu, they really should be) and the scallops.

Did I still eat most of the free tres leches dessert, even though I had that exact same dessert five hours ago? Yes. Because life is all about eating free food. Slightly longer version: The manager cares a lot about this restaurant, and it shows. He treated every table as though they were regulars. I like trying out new places in the city, so, rather unfortunately, I'm pretty much a newbie at every place I visit. I've seen a lot of restaurant owners belly up to regulars and spend the whole evening cracking jokes, and then toss a perfunctory ""How are things"" at my table. Here, the manager took the time to explain how the dishes were made without any animal fats, MSG or lard; he encouraged us to try the tres leches; and, best of all, he refilled our two buckets of chips when he saw we were running low. The table next to us had two birthdays, and he ran to get a second serving of tres leches for the other girl. When one customer left her scarf behind, he had a waiter run out and return it.

We also had the chocolate covered pretzel milkshake ($8), which wasn't really too great. That we definitely couldn't acquire the taste as it just tasted like a chocolate milkshake with a ton of salt poured into it. And yes, I mean a ton of salt that it didn't even taste like a chocolate covered pretzel anymore.Overall, would come back for the ice cream, maybe skip the milkshake next time.",26,0.9703

450,46,17,4.0,"New York City is no longer a stranger to the phenomenon of Thai rolled (or smashed) ice cream, and I CE NY is one of a handful of ice cream shops that specialize in this genre of desserts. For the unfamiliar, Thai rolled ice cream requires a process of spreading an even layer of ice cream base on a frozen plate chilled to -15 degrees F; the ""rolled"" ice cream is then made by evenly scraping thin strips into a swirl. Repeat five or six times (or more, depending on the size of the ice cream) and the end product one of the most beautiful (and time-intensive) ice cream cups that you'll lay eyes on.Located in the ever-busy epicenter of Greenwich Village, I CE NY is a pint-sized storefront easily identifiable by its seemingly never-ending line patrons that can run out the door; given that each ice cream is made to order, it's not surprising that waits are an inevitable occurrence. We'd done our best to arrive at an off-hour, but still wound up waiting for twenty or so minutes until we were able to make our way to the counter. It gave us plenty of time to review their menu, however, which offers a number of present concoctions as well as the option to customize your own ice cream given a choice of ice cream bases, mix-in ingredients, and final toppings and sauces.We wound up ordering the namesake Thai IC-E Tea, which began with a base of Thai Iced Tea Ice Cream and topped off the bowl with lychees, Choco Wafers, a drizzle of condensed milk, and whipped cream. The texture of the rolled ice cream is one of the more distinct qualities of this dessert; it's simultaneously light and creamy and seems to melt the moment it hits the tongue. While the actual flavor of the Thai Iced Tea wasn't as robust as I was hoping for, the final product was a success in taste and texture, and made for a sweet and surprisingly balanced spoonful, perfect for a warm day; after all, how can you go wrong with Choco Wafers and lychees?While it may be a little too complex and time-intensive of a treat to enjoy on a regular basis, I certainly give I CE NY credit for producing a quality dessert that's now available outside of its original borders. Give it at least one or two tries - and if you happen to pass by when there isn't a line out the door, you'll know that luck is one your side.",50,0.9923

452,42,23,4.0,"Back in the spring of 1998, I saw ""Phantom..."" on Broadway for the first time. It was part of a field trip with my 8th grade class. My priorities at the age of 13: Checking out the cool new stores down at South Street Seaport (when it was a viable mall), buying a cool ""South Park"" bumper sticker (since it was all the rage back at its inception), and general goofing off. When we arrived at the theater, Times Square was still more seedy than family-friendly; I still remember seeing a billboard for an adult theater boasting ""XXXPlosive Orgasms Guaranteed!"" (And, thanks to all of the ""What's Happening To By Body?"" books one of my aunts insisted on buying me during my formative years, I knew exactly what that billboard was referring to; telling my classmates made them laugh hysterically. Haaa.) My class did read the original novel as a class assignment prior to seeing the play; all I remember was being monumentally bored and being very disappointed when the chandelier took roughly five minutes to drop while the score pressed on. (In actuality, it probably took 15 seconds, but, in ""kid time""...) It's not that I hated it, but I viewed it as forced educational experience at the time. Flash forward 18 years, when I was given the opportunity to view it again. My appreciation of this musical is now, post-viewing, firmly in place. At a rousing two and a half hours (with one intermission), I fell in love with the plot, the characters, and the use of special effects. Honest to goodness, some of them (without giving away plot lines), are akin to any top - of - the - line magician's performance. The use of light and fire were wild; being 6 rows from the front of the stage, one part in Act II which had fire flaming on the stage made my face burn and my eyes scrunch. Conversely, I think the theater might want to forewarn anyone prone to seizures that there is ample use of flash lighting in this show; I had dots floating in my eyes on occasion after any particular use of them! The plot...well, it's very theatrical. Ha! To be expected, right? I heard one fellow audience member refer to the Phantom as a ""Stage Five Clinger"", and now, I'll probably always think of him that way. I loved many of the main characters, though, admittedly, Christine started to grate on me after a while. Despite his Stage Five Clinginess, I felt great empathy for The Phantom. Towards the finale, I started to get all of the feels, as the kids would say. I can definitely see why this has earned its title as the longest running musical on Broadway. It's a spectacle to be seen! Though I wouldn't be one of those people that sees it 10 more times, I am glad I was able to see it a second, as an adult. I definitely appreciated it more, and I am glad I was able to.",34,0.9971

457,22,17,4.0,"Tavern 29 is a American style craft brewery/ lounge/ restaurant in midtown. I came here to meet 6 friends on the weekend. Looking on tavern 29s website I was debating making reservations. There is 3 floors and the location didn't look that small. Good thing I made reservations the place was packed at 4:30pm on a Saturday. The hostess and security guard we're very nice and accommodating. The security and hostess helped us through the crowd to our private lounge table in the back. Thank you staff!!The lounge was private. But this place is noisy. There is top 20 hits playing and of coarse all of the people talking and laughing. It was a 20s-30 crowd. They put candles on every table to set the mood. At a bar?! Hmmm I would not recommend if you are on a date. Unless you like to go to loud bars on dates. The staff was above and beyond here for me! Our waitress was so funny even before I started drinking. She was busy but was attentive. When we were done the security guard came and escorted us back out this isn't LAVO or Provocateer or Tao. remember this is at a BAR!! A complete first for me, but a very nice gesture. I only had 1 issue here. On tavern 29s website. They list there menu and beer list. There is 3 floors at tavern 29. The beer list on the first floor where our lounge was. Was completely different than the list upstairs on the roof. Some of the menu items were different. This really confused me. It's not a bad thing. Just be aware of this. The beer list is all craft brewery's. You can buy growlers. If you are with a group. Buying s growler is cheaper than individual bottles. Of coarse no one wanted the same beer lol. I was the only one not drinking beer. I had 5 shots of belvedere. They had no grey goose at the bar. They did have some really good single malts I was tempted by. The food: the food was very good here. Tavern 29 has American style bar food taken to the next level. A lot of sandwiches and burgers. We ended up just getting 2 flatbreads to share. We started with the margarita flat bread. A very simple flat bread with sauce and fresh mozzarella. The flatbread was very good it had a nice char from the wood oven and was super Crispy. The second flat bread was the BBQ pulled pork flatbread. Personally I liked the BBQ flat bread better. There was way more flavor. It was pulled pork onions bacon cheese and BBQ sauce. Just so my YELPERs know. When you check in here you get a free guacamole app. My waitress had no issue with the check in. I don't eat guacamole but my friend said it was very good and creamy. Overall. Tavern 29 was nice. The flatbreads were great. The staff was fantastic. Just keep in mind about the menu. I would come back with friends for the food. They do honor the Yelp free guacamole check in!!!",30,0.9985
458,51,38,4.0,"For my 300th Review, I thought I'd review a place dear to my heart, haha. Kind of funny cause this is a dirty, cheesy, old school club in Tribeca, where I used to live, and have been coming to since the '90s.""M1-5"" is the city's zoning code for the neighborhood, which used to be 'Industrial', and a no-man's land between Chinatown and Tribeca. But the condo boom has swallowed up the area and called it 'Tribeca' to get higher apartment prices, changing the whole feel of the place.I gave M1-5 a 4-Star Rating for one thing and one thing only - for being and knowing what it is, which is one of the last remaining old school clubs in the city (along with Santos Party House) going back to the '80s/'90s. As Manhattan gentrified over the past 20 years, development unfortunately pushed out all the old clubs...The Tunnel, Roxy, Wetlands, Limelight, Palladium, Arc, Sway, Don Hill's, Twilo, Sound Factory, Subliminal, Centrofly, Vinyl, Nasa, Moskva, Brownies, Exit, Avalon, Save the Robots, etc, etc. Now, M1-5 doesn't hold a candle to the places above, but it does have a similar feel to them. And it's not like the annoying clubs of today (Marquee, Provocateur, Lavo, Avenue, Tao, for example).At M1-5, there's:No Velvet RopeNo Bottle Service crapNo Fashion StatementsNo Model WannabeesNo Spoiled Club Kids on MollyNo GlamourNo Cover chargeNo StatusNo TablesJust an All-Out, Free-For-All, Dance Party. Anyone can come in, you can wear whatever you want and you can dance wherever you want.Unfortunately though, these types of places will never be seen again in NYC as it's a different time now, different people, different scene, and different needs/wants. I actually read, that back in the '90s/'00s, there were 1,700 clubs with cabaret licenses operating in NYC...now there are around 100. A ""cabaret license"" is issued by the city, and is what is required for a bar/club to legally allow people to 'dance'. It's a dumb law that goes back to 1920's Prohibition. And because of this and development, the glory days of NYC clubs is long gone, relegated to the handful of velvet rope, Vegas-style clubs. A trend started by the first velvet rope club to open in Meatpacking in 2001, called Lotus, and to which Jennifer Lopez (remember her? lol) helped make famous and start the velvet rope era. Great, thanks J-Lo.The clubs have now turned into posers crammed at tiny tables with girls in Louboutins thinking they'll meet a rich guy there, but as we all know, hardly anyone has money in those clubs as they're all feeding off the promoters. And on top of all that, the '90s/'00s alcohol-fueled dance & makeout sessions on an actual dance floor have turned into the '10s Molly-fueled clubbers ""rolling"" to music by themselves, in a sardine-packed table. As you can see, times have changed.But fortunately, a tiny glimmer of the past still exists at M1-5, but don't expect too much, after all, it is just a dirty, cheesy, old school dance club that has fallen out of favor in NYC these days.And one last IMPORTANT thing...DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT show up here SOBER. You have to already have a few drinks in you to be able to handle this place. I've come sober before and had a horrible time - way too loud, people bumping into you, drinks getting spilled on you, etc. BUT, when I've come after a few drinks, I've had a great time. So, take my advice and have a few before you get there.And, of course...Enjoy (or maybe not enjoy) a taste of Old New York, haha.",59,0.9872

While this prevented me from waiting the constant hour long wait to get a seat for noodles, I was in the area yesterday running errands and like the sun on a cloudy day, the sky parted and there was no one waiting for seats. Soon to be remedied as 15 people showed up 10 mins after I sat down. I promptly ran down the stairs for the 1 spot at the bar that remained. OMG, Sooooooo tasty and fast.

460,35,15,4.0,"Holy Maroni! What an interesting concept. For lazy days, cold days, potluck days, and stress-eating days, get a pot of pasta delivered to your door ($15 delivery fee) or pick it up from the restaurant. You can also dine here, but I think it's really cool that you can order a piping hot meal to eat at home. From there, you can heat the pot directly on the stove and eat your meal for leftovers over the course of a couple of days.The pots come in 3 sizes, but the small one fits more than enough food for 2 people to share for at least 3 meals. Really!We ordered the small pot of spaghetti with meatballs and it was still pretty hot even after walking 20 blocks with it. The meatballs could have been seasoned a tad more, but the spaghetti was cooked al dente and wasn't limp at all; the sauce was robust and plentiful.

Sweet potato fries on the side. Food: Definitely not the healthiest but...... The turkey burger hit the spot- it was delicious! I bet it tastes better when you actually dine in. Since I got mine delivered, the bun was a bit too soft. But the meat was perfectly juicy and cooked, the toppings werent overwhelming and were properly sauteed like I had asked. The sweet potato fries were no where near crunchy or crisp, they were just too oily and super limpy. But given that I didnt dine in and had it delivered on a super windy, rainy NYC evening, I won't complain too much. Service: My 4 stars mainly stem from the fact that delivery was so quick and they also paid attention to any extra notes I made, like sending an extra plate and mustard on the side. I find it hard to have reliable delivery in NYC but this place seems attentive. Price: Eh, average. I spent $16 for food and tip included so it wasn't bad, but I'd definitely get more bang for my buck if I had gone elsewhere.Will I order again?Idk about order, but if I'm around, I'd be curious to dine in and see if theres any difference in the quality of the food.",38,0.9793
462,49,39,4.0,"Paradou can be a hit or miss in both atmosphere and food. If you're seated towards the front and order, 'the wrong entree', you will be experiencing a miss, if you ask to be seated towards the back and order what I would say is, 'the right entree', you're provided with a loud music dance party with a satisfying tasty meal that results imo as a hit. On this, one of my many visits, I was yet again handed a hit. I have had many experiences here, many, and this one can be added as another hit of a great time. I generally know what to order when coming here, so I can leave the establishment filled with a decent meal, which on this day was the Lamb Burger with figs and goat cheese spread, sooo good! Plus, enjoy my fill of many bottles of 'champagne', in this case inexpensive sparkling wines within a two hour time limit. What I enjoy about Paradou is that 8 times out of 10 brunch always and I mean always ends up with people dancing on chairs and tables, so funny and so much fun to watch. On this afternoon, aside from the usual girls dancing and a few boys dancing on tables, I had the opportunity to see the biggest guy I've ever seen twerk with the quickness of ease.

Let me start by saying that the bar is *tiny*. There were only a group of three there before us so we took over the back corner (10 of us). Old Man has a decent can selection for such a small spot. They had a variety that allowed for everyone to pick something different that they enjoyed. On top of that, there is a great happy hour special that included a dollar well shot for every beer purchased. We cashed in on those immediately. They have a little platform area with benches that the girls took over while the guys pounded shots for the birthday boy. The bartender was super nice and friendly.

We had fun selecting grill choices, with my fav being the Shishito Tsukune which is Japanese green pepper stuffed with chicken. The other excellent and re-ordered dish was the grilled Eringi Bacon, so tasty! Everyone ordered their own rice dish to complete the meal. My Nega Tori Don, chicken and egg over rice was simple and filling. Our young waiter was awesome, and kept up with our constant menu questions, beer re-orders and grill re-orders.

I went with the ahi tuna, the Shoyu (non-spicy) sauce, and added some edamame to it. My mom ordered the half & half with tuna and salmon, got the spicy sauce and added garlic krispies. They gave us a buzzer and we stood by the seating area waiting for our food. It didn't take too long, and it's an open kitchen area, so you can see them preparing your food. Once it was ready we grabbed it, and went back to the office to eat.  It was a generous sized portion. There was rice (I got brown), cucumbers, greens, seaweed salad, tobiko, tuna and the edamame I got as extra. It was a little hard to mix everything together in the container, but it wasn't too big of a deal for me. The fish and everything was really fresh. I tried my mom's to see how spicy the spicy sauce was, but it wasn't too bad. It would be like getting a spicy tuna roll or something when you get sushi.

We sat at the sushi bar with the intention of trying the Domokase, or basically their Omakase -- multi course signature meal of various sushi and hand rolls ($75). As my guest best put it, it is a 'starter' Omakase. For those with more Omakase experience, I wouldn't prepare oneself to be mind blown, but the sushi here was tasty overall.With the Domokase, we had a bottle of the Dassai50 Nigori Sake, which was a pleasant, smooth nigori to complement our variety of sushi. Below is a list of the various sushi provided with this meal --(oyster sampler) Jumbo oyster w/scallop, yuzu foam and ikuraEgg custard w/black truffle sauceChutoroMarinated SalmonSpanish MackerelHouse smoked Kampachi (similar to squid)King Salmon (smoky)Scallop w/yuzu (super puffy with slight tang)Japanese spot prawn w/topping of caviar (very clean, nice finish)Hand Rolls course and seasonal based (chef's choice premium sushi) --Negi Toro hand rollLobster hand rollUni hand roll (sweet and smoky)Because we were still hungry and also curious of this item, we tried their full Oyster sampler separate from the Domokase. This included the jumbo oyster w/scallop and yuzu plus Kumamoto oysters.Overall, I would say the Omakase here is small in comparison to some others I've experienced, though the $75 price tag is a bit of a reflection of that. Though while the portion seemed a bit on the smaller size, it was hard to point out particular stand out pieces but I did have my favorites. The Scallop w/yuzu was perhaps my favorite in the first half, the Uni hand roll was great in the hand roll course. My least favorite was the oyster sampler. While this dish looked incredible, the oysters were quite lackluster, and this was while in season. In general though, all the sushi was made of high quality ingredients and made with precision/TLC, so this is respectable Omakase. If you are looking for a 'starter' Omakase, I would highly recommend DomoDomo. I would personally return again for the lower cost yet quality Omakase in a more intimate/modern environment. Comparatively to some lower cost Omakase spots, DomoDomo has the upper hand with the classier and more modern space.",34,0.997

We had to stand but were by the window so I hopped my cute little booty up on the sill and was able to get a bird's eye view of the show. I also suggest to check your coats for $3 if you weren't lucky enough to grab a seat. If you're parked close, your best bet is probably to just leave them in the car. There are viewing areas on two levels and you're probably going to find a spot at the very top of you're early enough. They have a bar and servers so you can definitely stay and chill. The host, Murray Hill, was hilarious. This particular night, he was dressed like furniture...inside joke. We only stayed for the midnight show but they have another after intermission at 1AM and I believe they turn into a go-go bar with live dj after the last show. All of the acts were good.

From the bouncer/manager to the bar staff they are all pretty cool.Terrific vibe. Long bar with plenty of stools, comfy bench seating and tables. Nice decor.Kitchen open late. Yeah, because sometimes after a late night out partying you just need a good burger. Small menu though. The times I have been here we have rolled in after midnight. Food! Boom!Prices are ok but for what they do charge for a burger you would think a side of fries would accompany it. Charging for both separately gets a bit costly. At least they do offer a happy hour here too. Can't ask for much more than that. If you want to avoid the fratty crowds that pack into the beer swilling bars up in this part of town, and want a more mature laid back place to spend a few hours or more in a cozy atmosphere, then saunter up alongside Joe's and let him take you on a magic carpet ride.",43,0.9572
470,43,29,4.0,"I came here today after getting a craving for kalbi/Korean BBQ. With only the non-ideal/overpriced Mill Korean nearby, I lamented my situation -- until I remembered iFood! I've only eaten here once before, when I ordered the tacos which no longer seem to be on the menu. The tacos were a bit pricy, given the size (small corn tortilla) and high shredded cabbage/lettuce to meat ratio. There was a lot of sauce, which was delicious, but a tad much for a single corn tortilla to handle.Today, I ordered the regular spicy pork (jeyeuk) for $7. While not exactly what I had in mind, it was certainly good enough to fill my craving. The regular size comes with a fair portion of meat over a large serving of rice and a side of pickled daikon slices and a couple pickles. The meat is well seasoned and flavorful, and consists of a good mix of lean pieces and a few fattier ones. The ""spicy"" doesn't have much heat to it, but it does have the flavor of gochujang, albeit milder. Overall, iFood provides a nice, cheap lunch which is nice in a city (and especially the Morningside neighborhood) lacking Korean food for under $15. Looking at other reviews, it seems the ddeokbokki might be the best dish here, and I'll be sure to try it next time.",39,0.9871
471,42,19,4.0,"I came here with some hesitation as this bowling alley is attached to port authority and I thought it had the possibility of being the sketchiest thing ever. HOWEVER, I came here and was blown away but how great it was. There was complimentary coat check on the bottom floors and the whole place looked nice and clean. My friend had set up a party here, reserving three lanes for a group of friends. Each lane came with either a beer tower or a pitcher of margarita. We got pomegranate flavor and it was delicious. We also got a side of fries which were crispy and hot. Delicious!As for the lanes, they were clean with plenty of bowling bowls, a table and cubbies to put shoes or purses. It had everything that was needed. This place had multiple areas including a couple of bar areas with TVs playing sports and plenty of space for sitting down. The music that night was hip hop and my friends and I couldn't help but get down and dirty. When Puff Daddy calls out his bad boys for life, we just had to obey. Overall, it was a great time. Great food, friends, bowling and drinks. I would definitely recommend it for group gatherings looking for something to do.",39,0.9956
472,60,47,4.0,"They have a great lunch buffet in terms of diversity of items as well as the taste. I came during the huge Blizzard of 2016, and they were still open and remarkably full. The lunch buffet goes until 4pm! So that's perfect for those night owls who can't get up before noon on the weekends...In any case, the decor itself is nice. I guess the one annoying thing that happened was that when we arrived at 2:50pm during the blizzard, there was one other party there. We were told to sit anywhere we want. We chose a 4-person table at one corner with good lighting. Someone ran over and told us that we couldn't sit there. We asked why, and they said they had a reservation. We asked when. They said 2:50pm. I was going to get angry right there. It was obviously a lie. Who makes a reservation during a blizzard for an Indian buffet at 2:50pm??? In any case, we didn't escalate it and sat at a dark 4-person table. We later brought it up to the manager, and he apologized and said it should never have happened. The buffet itself was delicious. They had your standard chicken tikka masala as well as lamb and fish options. In addition, they had a vegetarian section with saag paneer (tasted different than others I've had...) and some kind of breaded veggie. In any case, all good. They also had a dessert bar with mango pudding and rice pudding. Very good. Overall, the price was also reasonable, at under $15.",60,0.9816

474,26,12,4.0,"Speakeasies are all the rage these days, but how often do you find a ramen shop tucked away inside a coffee café? Welcome to Kopi Ramen, a 1-month old new Japanese noodle restaurant in the heart of West Village. My gf and I first entered through the Kopi Kopi Coffee shop and walked to the back where we were greeted by the host, who slid open the back door to reveal a quaint, cute eatery. The lighting is dim, the space cozy, and the atmosphere sultry. They have an open kitchen where you can watch the chefs prepare your dishes.The menus is short, with about 5 appetizers and 5 noodle dishes, along with some sakes and other alcohol drinks. We pretty much ordered all the appetizers, the spicy miso ramen, and the shoyu ramen. The miso-braised pork belly came with five pieces, each sitting on seaweed and garnished with scallions/chives. They were cooked perfectly and was by far the best appetizer choice. The stuffed-chicken-wing gyoza came out to be more interesting in concept than execution. While the chicken was delicious, the inside stuffing felt bland and could have used more seasoning. The charred edamame is a spin on the usual raw edamame. My gf did not like the roasted taste. I thought it gave it character that other edamames do not have. I will say that roasting them makes it more difficult to eat, as some parts of the shell are blackened and add a soot-y taste. The last appetizer was the tofu salad. It was pretty average.My shoyu ramen was delicious - as a soy-sauce base ramen, it was very light yet filling. The chashu pieces were cooked perfectly. The slices melted in your mouth. My gf's spicy miso ramen was more hearty and thick. I preferred that one because I like it when the broth is overflowing with flavor. So depending on your preference, you can go with the lighter shoyu or the heavier miso. Overall, the ramen made a solid impression on us and the attentive service made me a fan!",32,0.9945

It's these huge, fluffy doughnuts that seem to swoosh down your gullet and crash on your hips if you eat too many. The service remains friendly and welcoming at this Flatiron outpost, the doughnuts still delightful with their softy, yeasty interior. I did have to subtract one star on my 2016 updated review for their glazes. For some reason, the glazes don't pack the punch they used to. I am not sure if it was an off day but the brilliantly hued hibiscus was a dull pink. Sis noticed it immediately as it was her fave flavor. It also was not as tart as usual. Then my old standby, the salted chocolate caramel, also lacked some oomph. There nice contrast of salt versus the sweetness of chocolate wasn't as powerful as many times before. I can't say the passionfruit wowed me as amazingly as before. Dough, oh Dough, what happened? Did you change your baking standards? I wish you would make minis, as you did on the Holiday Hangover. I am still fond of your doughnuts and will be back to taste them soon and hopefully up my rating back to 5 stars again.",35,0.9884

Yeah, they supply that too, but I'd rate it only worthy of alcohol absorbing. The salsas are alright, with the pico de gallo outshining the verde by several watts. The queso fundido is also pretty tasty, along with refried beans. Basically, anything that is best eaten on a chip is good here. Getting any ideas? Yep!

This place has a restaurant and a full bar on the first floor but I advice you not eat here because the food really wasn't all that great when I had it. That's really was my only complaint about this place, they could really do a better job in terms of quality, and presentation of the food overall. However, ""the park atmosphere"" brings happy feelings to life, with lighting on the trees in the building it really puts a good vibe to your soul making you want to get up and have an epic time.""Let me take you threw the rooms""Literally as you get upstairs you will notice there are plenty and I mean PLENTY of rooms that you can go into with different music to suit your dancing needs for the night. I say base it on your mood. They mainly play some of the best house/hip-hop/edm music out there and each dj is really on point with their mixes, so you will find yourself grooving to the beat non-stop then your gonna realize it's time to go the next second you look at your phone. Some rooms offer a really cool view of New York and has a full bar also on the upper parts of the room. Plenty of seats for big groups and parties I highly suggest if you want a seat, reserve seat ahead of time so you avoid people being anal about seat arrangements.""Overall""Come walk around the park with your friends, it's magical.

Green shashuka- baked eggs cooked in tomato sauce with spinach and feta. This would have made this dish even more delicious if the eggs were poached instead.. I got fooled by one of the yelp pictures for some reason..2.

480,22,10,4.0,"I hired this company to move me from Brooklyn to Long Island City. From what I can tell, they seem to have the most reasonable pricing. That being said, you do get what you pay for. The move didn't go completely without a hitch, but for the price you really can't beat it. I think they tend to overbook, so unfortunately the move happened an hour later than expected, however they were good about staying in touch and letting us know about the delay, which I appreciated. Another thing that was a little bothersome was that I was initially quoted for two movers, but instead three showed up, which obviously affected the price. In the end it worked out fine and the move went faster and more pain free having the extra help. I think they also added additional fees that weren't initially mentioned, though I'm not entirely sure for what.Apart from that, everything was great. The movers were very nice and came prepared with tools and packing materials. They were quick and efficient, and moved everything in neatly. No broken items or scratched up hallways.I would recommend this company to those looking for moving services that don't want to spend an arm and a leg, and who are ok with being a little more laid back about the process. What I mean is, if you're paying these kinds of prices, don't expect perfection or the professionalism you might find with a company charging double or triple. Was my experience perfect, no, but the move got done and life was a lot easier not having to deal with any of it myself.",30,0.969
481,49,35,4.0,"Bohemian Restaurant is that boy in your high school English Lit class with whom you (and every other girl) were fabulously infatuated but you've never actually spoken to him. In fact, he rarely speaks. Last time he said something in class, you heard that some girl fainted on site. Then there are stories about him rescuing kittens from trees and performing CPR on a drowning kid last summer.Basically, he wears a cloak of mystery and inaccessibility. And for that, you are curious. You want to get to know him.He is the Bohemian Restaurant.As many have mentioned already, you need to get the phone number from someone who has dined here previously (or have the googling skills of my 85 year old grandma - I promise, it's out there). Be prepared to spell out the first AND last name of the person who you gave you said number. (No, I am not giving you my last name.) Alternatively, you can email them with a description of yourself and why you want a reservation. (Check their website for more details.)After seeing the place for myself (someone's cozy living room fitted with 6 pairs of low-to-the-ground leisure accent chairs, a signed guitar, hanging artwork, standing coat rack, and an indoor Japanese garden), I imagine that they want to maintain a chill dining atmosphere in which everyone who walks in is especially welcome because they were introduced by a friend. It's like having your friend vouch for you on a blind date -- yeah, man, she's cool, I swear. We went to preschool together and she was great at sharing. They also have the fact that the space was once owned by Andy Warhol and used as a studio for street-artist Jean Michel Basquiat, playing up the laidback, artsy vibe going for them.When I called, I was told that they only had bar seating available. But upon arrival (walk down the long hallway to the left of the Japanese Premium Beef butcher shop), we were offered table seating! It was our lucky day! (Actually, the two large 6-person tables were empty the entire time we were there 6:30PM-9PM.)Even though it was our first visit, we ordered a la carte because most of the dishes we wanted to try were not in the $58 tasting menu.The absolute star of the night (besides the panna cotta) was the Uni Croquette. It was perfectly fried and crispy on the outside with a lightly flavored mushroom cream inside (soft peaks, y'all bakers). The dollop of uni on top completed the trifecta as its ""fishiness"" (if any) was completely masked by the mushroom. Ingenious, really. Each piece is $13 so make sure you order one for each of you. WORTH IT.As a non-cheese loving person, my fave part about the Mac & Cheese was the tomato butter toast. The mac & cheese itself was extremely cheesy and they used cheeses with a sharp finish (blue cheese, maybe?). But when you slather it atop the toast, it tasted like gourmet pizza for a moment, YUM. Bohemian was playing my emotions now.The Miso Black Cod and Washu Beef Steak were alright. The size of a Miso Black Cod was just smaller than a 20-something girl's fist (you get 2 pieces). It was a little too charred and salty for our tastes, but it was definitely cooked just right. The black cod nearly fell apart as we chopstick-ed it to our personal plates. When we ordered the Washu Beef Steak (market price), our server brought out a chalkboard in the shape of a cow to physically show us the beef cuts they had available. We ordered the 10.5 oz flat iron (shoulder) cut; the mound of rare steaks covered a bed of roughly cut potatoes and fried garlic cloves.The Yuzu Panna Cotta was silky and light with bursts of sourness if you get a piece of the yuzu jelly in that helping. It's actually not listed on the normal dessert menu, but our server happily brought it out for us upon our request. So good!!Ah, and we ordered the Plum Sake and the Bergamot (earl grey infused gin with raw egg whites, pomegranate syrup & bitters), both light drinks that complemented our meal.Minor things we were disappointed in:- Seemingly lack of knowledge about the cuts of beef - our server could not confidently explain each cut in layman's terms e.g. rib-eye, sirloin, T-bone: ""Maybe this area or this area,"" he said.- We were never asked as to how we like our steak cooked. I understand that this may have been the chef's choice, but if we don't usually eat rare steaks (this child aka me is getting there... slowly), I doubt we will suddenly realize that this mess of blood and juice has changed our lives forever -- but we powered through most of it (& took the remainder home).Now that we've walked through this cloud of secrecy and seen the other side, I assure you Curious Georges that it's a good dining experience, but it won't be the best meal of your life.Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose.",49,0.9969

I can't remember the name of the cocktail I drank, which was served in this cute copper mug, had whiskey + lime juice or something...it was amazing. I drank every drop and would've had more, but we were moving on to the next venue. Back to this appropriately named ""You Fancy Huh? Truffle Burger"" of Brian's. By the time I showed up, their food scraps were cold, but my friend insisted that I sample this wonderful thing. I can't lie.

485,35,16,4.0,"At first glance, El Rey is one of the last places you'd find me in. It initially appears to be an agglomeration of the most recent health food trends of late, espousing a vegetable-centric menu where ingredients such as chia seeds, quinoa, avocado, and farro are all readily found. Nonetheless, the overwhelmingly positive reviews sparked my curiosity and when a few friends suggested it for a weekend brunch, I was more than willing to see what it had to offer.El Rey is aptly located in the Lower East Side, a tiny venue that sports a bustling kitchen counter where seating consists of a handful of tables and various counters; holding over ten people at a time would be pushing its capacity, so dining in isn't necessarily a guarantee. Orders are placed at the counter and assigned a number; it's a simple and efficient process that easily falls in the ""fast casual"" category. The food, however, is far from what you'll find at your typical chain restaurant.First, the ""Everything Bagel"" I tried was one of the most creative riffs on the traditional breakfast item. Instead of the traditional dough, a dense base of Za'atar bread was used, and served as the perfect vehicle for the generous serving of ricotta cheese, dill, and seeds. A few slivers of sliced red onion for freshness, and you have a perfect compilation of flavors and textures, and a surprisingly successful take on one of my guilty pleasures.Another surprise was the Lost Bread Egg Frittata, a dish that I would best describe as a chilled egg custard. The ""lost bread"" comes into play because of the addition of brioche in the egg custard, which gives it the unique denseness and texture. Drizzled in a fragrant pesto and topped with a shaved fennel salad and crushed avocado, it's a surprisingly delicious and well-balanced dish, and certainly one that tastes better than it actually looks.I have to say that El Rey surpassed my expectations, and I can see why it's done so well in NYC. Some might write it off as just another place following the health-conscious food trends of late, but the dishes served here are a unique blend of Middle Eastern and Mexican ingredients and flavors that are surprisingly successful in execution. I'd recommend visiting at an off-hour to make sure you can get a seat, or planning on taking your order to go; certainly, it's fair to say their popularity is justified.",34,0.9926
486,14,7,4.0,"Rai Rai Ken is our go-to ramen spot in the EV. Ippudo and Momofuku are great, but the lines can be crazy long and sometimes, you just gotta get a good bowl of ramen fast.I almost always get the lunch or dinner specials here, which comes with a bowl of any ramen, an appetizer, a drink, and a mochi for dessert. I can't remember the prices exactly, but I think it was around $14.The pork buns here are amazing, rivaling Ippudo's. The housemade sweet and spicy chili sauce they serve with them is out of this world, and I am glad they give me a bowl big enough to spread all over my bun.The ramen is solid. I tend to get the shoyu ramen, but have also had the japanese curry ramen base here. Both of which are great. I like a lot of spice, to I usually dump that sweet chili oil into my broth too. There is a good ratio of noodles to broth, a well-cooked soft-boiled egg, some pork, some green onions and other garnish as well. Delicious.I have only had to wait here one time for a table, it seems that Rai Rai Ken has found a good balance of quick service, and a crowd that likes a quick turnaround. I wouldn't expect a party to come here and sit for hours, it's in-eat-out for most.The place is small and not as well decorated as some of their competitors, but does that really matter?

487,16,14,4.0,"The so-called Doughnut Bubble is less likely to burst than the Cupcake Bubble. Remember the cupcake penetration of roughly 2008 - 2013? Cupcake shops, cupcake food trucks, cupcake competition TV shows, cupcakes EVERYWHERE. Then...*kaboom*. While a few did survive the explosion (Hey, Molly's!), many were left in the dust. In the ashes, artisanal doughnuts started to take their place. While cupcakes are a fun treat, they don't have the portability that a doughnut has. That's why I don't see the Doughnut Bubble bursting anytime soon.The Doughnut Project is an excellent addition to many of the other awesome and creative doughnut shops in NYC. Having only yeast doughnuts (my fave!), their flavors don't necessarily rival other places like Doughnut Plant or Dough, so it provides a good competition for them. I went with a couple of friends after gorging ourselves on brunch up the street, so I took mine to go! I ordered the Bronx (olive oil and black pepper; savory-sounding, but actually sweet!), the Constanza (chocolate-dipped with crushed pretzels), and the Pumpkin King (glazed with cinnamon-roasted pepitas). I loved all of them equally, the subtlety of the Bronx lending it to be my favorite of the three. My friends got the peanut butter and jelly doughnut, seemingly enjoying theirs! My only minor complaint would be the flakiness I encountered with the glazes; they seemed to crumble off of the doughnuts quite easily with the white-glazed donuts (the Bronx and the Pumpkin King), though the chocolate glaze stayed more in tact with the Constanza. The interior is absolutely crazy, with a huge emphasis on ""Star Wars"" and splashy bright colors! There is limited seating, but enough to post up and enjoy a sweet treat while people watching folks strolling along Morton Street. I can't wait to try out more flavors in the future! If I wasn't so full from brunch, I would have gone for the bacon-topped doughnut stick, but at least I have a goal for my next visit. ;-)- - - -NOTE: After further discussion with my friends, it turns out that there wasn't any peanut butter inside of their PB&J doughnut! I remember noting this and saying that maybe it was simply in the dough, but They realized it after looking through photos on Yelp and seeing Mike C.'s photo of the PB&J. This doesn't affect my review, per se, but they were a little bummed once they made the realization. Haaa. Hopefully they can go back for one that's absolutely LOADED with it.",16,0.9936
488,8,10,4.0,"Mission Chinese is both a three star experience and a four star review. It is very difficult for me to rate these folks three stars primarily because of the high quality ingredients they employ. And since taste is highly subjective I'm not going to suggest that my taste buds are any better than yours. We ordered the $40 per person tasting menu and mapo tofu was amongst the dishes. The mapo tofu for instance, was the best I've ever had but I don't like mapo tofu. Since there was no substitution of dishes permitted we begrudgingly dealt with it. Stir fried celery was NBFD. Stealing the evening was the green tea noodles. Double happiness yummy. I enjoyed the fried chicken but be forewarned that they go out of the way to make it extra spicy. My company couldn't handle it. I'm told that the pizza is good. Apparently there was a preexisting pizza oven when MC took over the spot and the owners decided to keep it. Annoying to me was the obscure wine list. Since I'm not an oenophile perhaps I didn't know the selections. However I felt that folks like moi should be able to identify at least one red or white from the menu. It isn't a big deal to add a red and white Mondavi to the list; just say you're out when an nitwit like yours truly orders it.  The place was hopping with hipster DBs going out of their millennial minds to converse at heavy metal concert decibels. The wait staff--which was composed of the same folks--were pushy and indifferent. MC is most certainly not a place for non-hip geezers--once again like yours truly. However, the very happy greeting gents at the door were excellent!I probably will not return but that doesn't mean you shouldn't visit.

I am torn between a 3 star and 4 star review, but decided to round up because I'm assuming that most of my complaints are due to the fact that I ordered food (i.e., burger and fries) that doesn't really keep its texture during the delivery process. -The Chipotle burger, ordered medium rare, with fries: The burger and fries combo is famously difficult get right in a delivery order. It always comes with a soggy bun and uncrispy fries, and yet I never learn. This time the burger was actually really good (more like a medium than medium rare though) but the fries were not that crispy. I think I would have loved this if I ordered it piping hot in the restaurant. Note that the Chipotle burger doesn't come with lettuce and tomatoes. -The Volcan (skirt steak with rice, beans, and pico de gallo-like salad): The steak was a bit on the tough side (overcooked), but flavorful. The rice and beans were AMAZING and same with the salad. If you order this, be sure to order the steak medium rare or rare because the cook seems to cook everything one or two degrees more done than it should be. This dish was substantial in portion size.

On the menu was porkbelly tacos, chicken tacos, plantains, shrimp, chips w/ salsa and guac and some of the most addicting delicious churros with chocolate sauce I could ever imagine. I had like 15 of them, no joke. Usually I have a lot to complain about at these events because waiters are often terrible about bringing drinks and food in a timely manner and being attentive to the entire group. Mayahuel was the exception. We had one waitress and two food runners. They were on point. The waitress would ask about my next drink perfectly on time, every time when I had about 1/4 of my drink remaining.Every food item was always present on the table and if something sat for too long it was promptly replaced.  Drinks were delicious too. I never made it past the tequila & mezcal old fashioned. Picture a smokey old fashioned. Quite delightful. I definitely want to come back here.",26,0.9758

(I thought that was a really professional thing to do)We got there and were seated right away. All of us starving as usual. We ordered a bunch of apps. The chicken wings were ah-mazing! Super spicy and very very flavorful with big chunks of chicken. The Surf and Turf was quite the platter too. I wasn't a huge fan of the shitake mushroom spring rolls, they were mediocre at best. We then ordered a couple of bottles of Rioja red wine! Paired perfectly with all the dishes. Mains we got some pad thai dishes, the burger, lamb and hung lai. I was not a fan of the burger.

The tablet menus have pictures as well as descriptions to what your options are, and it isn't just sushi. They have edamame, egg rolls, noodles, soups, salads, pastries, etc. After choosing everything you want you just hit send and wait.

502,35,20,4.0,"When fuku+ opened a little closer to me in a dining space behind Momofuku Milk Bar, I thought, 'hey, why not?' so we made a little visit on a Saturday around 1pm. To our surprise, there was no line at all! While all of the tables with seats were occupied, the standing bar and standing center tables were pretty empty. Given its location, I'm sure the lunchtime crowds during the week are unbearable, so I'd suggest coming here during the weekend for a proper meal. Things were a bit hectic that day because the POS broke down, so we had to wait a bit for our food. Here's what we ate: - MiniMe: This was a smaller version of original fuku's signature fried chicken sandwich. Sweet potato rolls sandwiched a giant piece of spicy fried chicken--the bun to chicken ratio was almost comical. The breading was spicy and the dark meat chicken itself was pretty juicy, and I understood why fuku was so popular. While being a miniature version of the original, I felt like the piece of fried chicken was large, so it was actually quite filling.  - Fuku Bites: These were small crispy nuggets, again with the same spicy breading. The green thick sauce that came with it made it so much better, though. It contained a heavy dose of garlic and honey.  - Juicy Lucy: This was an off-menu item that was a burger filled with cheese. It was messy and way too rich for my liking, but J enjoyed it a lot.  - Mission Chinese Fuku Fingers ($16, but $1 goes to charity): Being a collaboration menu item with Mission Chinese's Danny Bowien, I was hesitant to try this. I had terrible flashbacks of the night we went to Mission Chinese and I ate one bite of the mapo tofu and felt like my esophagus had been torched. However, much to my surprise, these chicken fingers were delicious and not all too spicy. The Chongqing spice blend, chili oil, and sliced scallions were phenomenal and I definitely found myself trying to get as much of that oil onto the chicken fingers as possible. I'm not even ashamed to say that I even scraped up the oil with my own fingers.Likelihood of another visit:For another weekend lunch--sure. For some other kind of collaboration menu item--extra sure.",32,0.9814

My froyo I would've typically paid no more than $6 anywhere else but here it was $7 even with the 10% off. Froyo: loooots of flavors. I got the marshmallow and birthday cake- both delicious.

I love the Mason jar candles, my next DIY project!Caitlin was our server and she was awesome, great energy and she handled three hungry and tipsy people very well. She had great recommendations for us, esp for the pickles. We got the option of 4 jars for $11 - Thyme jalapeño (too spicy for me), Carrots (hint of cinnamon,my favorite)Kosher cukes (pretty good)Dilly green beans (could eat a pound of these) We were off to a great start!Next, I had the fried chicken biscuit sandwhich smothered in sausage gravy with organic cheese grits on the side. Pretty good. I'll break down every element for you. The square biscuit is large, buttery, soaked up the gravy. The chicken is crispy, but didn't feel heavy or too heart stopping haha. But a bit spicy. The best part is the sausage gravy, chunky with lots of sausage. The cheddar cheese grits were the best I've had in a long time! We also shared the cast iron mac n cheese, food orgasms continue...We weren't done yet. Fried Oreos. Okay, these were heart stopping! They pack a serious crunch and the cream they come with is light and airy. Loved them. Drinks are strong. One Manhattan up took me all night to drink. And I am the Manhattan queen. Oh!! The music is dope! We listened to 90's, 00's, and current R&B and hip hop. We were jammin out with the ladies next to us all night. Every song was the jam.

508,31,15,4.0,"Probably one of the best lobster rolls in Manhattan belongs to Mary's Fish Camp in the West Village. But if we compare it to Pearl's Oyster Bar, you will note their similarities. It is hard to say which is the better roll, but I can genuinely say Mary's should not disappoint if you are a fan of that Maine style roll; lobster bits dressed in light mayo on nicely toasted/lightly buttered bread.You may want to arrive earlier since there are no reservations taken and seating is limited. No doubt you should try the Lobster Roll (MP) upon first visit. Comes with a side of shoe string fries, salad or cole slaw. For appetizers, we shared the Canadian Steamers with drawn butter and lemon ($16). My first time having steamers, they are very similar to mussels in flavor and consistency. And as a fan of mussels, I enjoyed their steamers as a light(er) starter. Just don't forget to remove the 'sock' before dipping into the butter and taking a bite. As for that Lobster Roll, the lobster is fresh and dressed with perfect balance, but I missed that bit of a lemony kick. They did place a lemon slice to the side of the plate, which I am guessing I should have used. Had I done that, I think the roll might have tasted just a tad better. That hint of lemon is certainly more prominent in Pearl's version, if we compare, and it just makes it slightly better because of that. Nonetheless, the bun was nice in terms of flavor and texture. The fries were crispy and nicely cut, and they pile a lot of fries on your plate. In terms of the portion, it can be a bit too much, but I suppose that should not be something to complain about.Overall, a solid restaurant for a solid lobster roll. The rest of their menu sounds really great though, so I will be sure to return and try other entrees.",37,0.9952

It would be polite to say that its decor fits in very nicely with the general appearance of its neighborhood.Most people who work here don't speak English, or at least English as the American people know it.No, this place is not America. This place is, however, a godsend for New Yorkers who are tired of $10.99/lb chicken breasts at Whole Foods that come with the bird's lineage and life story. It's chicken, man!

Why? Because soy sauce bottles be heavy, yo!Everything here is on the cheaper side, especially the meats and vegetables. You can't help but stock up if like me, you don't make it down here quite as often as you'd like. There are also tons of Chinese groceries that you can't find elsewhere. White rabbit candy? Green tea pumpkin seeds? Every type of ramen imaginable? It's all there for the taking.Some people have this instinctive association of Chinatown with poor sanitation, and if you walk down grand street one too many times, I can see how you might get that impression. Honestly though, just because this area is old doesn't mean it's unclean. You can get your food from the most squeeky clean vendor, but that don't mean diddly squat if you don't handle and cook it properly at home. There's a reason you never see any raw dishes in Chinese cooking.But truth be told, I'm not sure why I even bother defending the unruliness of this place and Chinatown in general.

The art, from street artists such as Shepard Fairey, was so new that you could still smell the spray paint upstairs. Luckily, the opening event was being held downstairs, in a fume-free environment. I didn't quite see the supposed street art/street food connection that the waiter was talking about, but there were definitely some tasty bites among the limited menu of shareable plates that was available. The white pizza was a bit salty from the nduja sausage, I think, but the crust was delightfully thin and crisp, and I liked the unique crunch of the hazelnuts, which was a fun topping. The juicy lucy ""heaven spot burger"" was kind of a strange item to share, but it was perfectly cooked, oozing with housemade American cheese, The nduja-stuffed fried olives were just okay, but the cacio e pepe arancini were great, and came with an amazingly creamy ""parmesan espuma"" dipping sauce that I definitely wanted more of. Drinks took forever, but the waitress was quite apologetic. I had the Lost and Found: gin, aperol, sage simple syrup, lemon, currant tea, and angostura bitters with a thyme garnish. It was dark in the restaurant and the type was really small, so I didn't realize it was a tea-based cocktail until after I ordered, which was probably why I didn't love it. The vibe was definitely reminiscent of Beauty & Essex. There were some ridiculous girls in the bathroom squealing about how they ""couldn't wait to party here."" Gag.

I suggest the other Totto locations. In any case, they have your standard assortment of Ramen. Their broth is delicious, and the toppings are also done very well. However, it's not the sort of place you linger because you can see the line forming outside. I've made the mistake of coming here without enough cash.

It is an open space with 10 upcycled wooden and metal tables. The seats are bit too high or the tables are bit too low. There is plenty of window counter seats both inside and outside. There is some cool art: tiger, tupac, monkey king, and a steel shark submarine. I ordered my ramen with a temporary marker on a laminated menu sheet. I had the tonkotsu ($9.5) which only includes Broth, Noodles, Bean Sprouts, Corn, green onion, and sautéed vegetables. I opted for Egg add-on ($2.5). It comes out on a pretty tray with a spot for your bowl, chopsticks, and napkin. Even though you don't get meat, you do get a small bowl to sample their vegetables from the pickle bar. There are 6 options: corn, carrots, cucumbers, cabbage, green beans, and daikon. The corn was standard. The carrots were diced and tossed with mayo and black pepper. The cucumbers were lightly pickled. The cabbage had sweet and spicy oil. The green beans were crisp and sour. The Yellow Daikon is called ""Takuan"" which named for its Zen monk inventor. It's unique bright yellow color is naturally occurring through the cultivation of bacillus subtilis bacteria during fermentation. However it's often heightened by the addition of persimmon peels, nasturtium flowers, or other coloring agents. It has a mild citrus and light funkiness. The Broth was mildly fatty with a good amount of salt and meat flavor. The medium sized kinky noodles were cooked al dente. The barely poached sunny side up egg was a delightful change to the normal soft boiled. The standard toppings of Bean sprouts, corn, and green onions were standard my good. The sautéed bok choy and broccoli was different but welcomed. Overall, it was an enjoyable meal but the starting price point of $9.5 is expensive without the inclusion of protein.

I want to share some items that I usually buy rather than store stocks many Japanese and so on..""Shiho No Shizuku/紫峰の滴""If you are tired of usual soy sauce, this soy sauce is a great choice to try. The Umami is undeniable, light in color but strong in Umami. Fantastic with fresh sashimi and sushi, and as well as a dressing, with EVOO or sesame oil with fresh squeeze of lemon. Also, excellent to marinate fresh fish or meat with it. It enhances its flavors. Downside to some is it has a high content of salt. Usually this sauce is out of stock so don't hesitate to ask to re-order for more. One staff that has a husky-sexy deep voice for women knows a good knowledge of the items they have. Her recommendations has been on point. She also shares how she likes, add a drop to chicken soup, or noodles and so on. I don't know her name but if you see a mature looking lady, usually on the floor, ask her any question on their items. She is very helpful. She has already introduced me to many new products. Kimichi I've seen Kimchi in a jar everywhere but I can find this particular one only here in my neighborhood; Sunrise or M2M don't have it either. Some like Kimchi to be sweet, spicy, sour, or even garlicky. This Kimchi Pride & Foods has all of that. But nothing closer to a love-infused homemade Kimchi. Organic chemical free seafood granule stocks in a bag are another best picks for me. There are several of them. I mix few different kind, Konbu, Bonito, and a little fishy but amazing Iriko (anchovy), that were all granules, to create my special Umami broth (Dashi).

Yoshinoya is one of the Japanese fast food chain restaurants and only offers beef don.Bentos and hot foods; I previously reviewed of Chirashi bowl and sushi to be not good enough but recently when I tried, they aren't so bad, for price.

There is even a self checkout and a security guard. It does indeed cater to kids and their families, as I noted the children's floor was on the bottom and adults had to go up to the second floor. Thankfully there is an elevator for those who can't navigate the stairs. I visited at a time when the kiddies weren't out in hordes and screaming. As for the Yelper who complained about a homeless person, NYPL got sued for trying to keep some homeless people out who came in and reeked. So I guess they aren't allowed to keep out homeless people unless they are dangerous. I have noticed, depending on the library, many homeless just camping out at certain libraries. It may not be ideal if the homeless smell bad but unfortunately, the library is unable to eject them. When I was checking out some books, I did notice a man snoring loudly at a table.

Not too much right....The amount of food provided was plentiful. The salmon and tuna were super fresh and all of the add-in ingredients tasted great. Overall, it was a great quality of food and I really appreciated that you can add so much to enhance your bowls. I think the only thing I would improve on is the sauce add-on. Although it looked like the server put on a lot (honestly I was thinking ""whoa that's a lot of sauce added on"") I found it at the end to be lacking. My friends who also got bowls with other sauces, like the umami shoyu, were adding extra soy sauce and sesame oil on after we had brought it back to a friend's apartment to eat.

CHEEESUS CRUST--what is this world coming to when we all can't come together and enjoy the joys of cheap pizza without going all negative?the only thing that puzzles me about this place other than how they make money on cheap pizza is their long-ass name. it's not how 99 cent pizza places are making money--it's the fact that we've all been ripped off by NYC pizza places for years by buying plain slices that are priced betw $3.00 to $4 when we all know pizza be cheap to make. GREED IS GOOD 'cept when pizza fatcats ARE taking money outta my pocket, CUZ.i digress. anyway back to F&F. from Sun-Th -- the guys here sling pizza til 11 pm. on Fri and Saturday...they stay open super-late to serve the WALKING DRUNKS and fight hangover zombiedom with carby saucy cheesiness. the slices are 99 cents. they are on the smallish side, but you get what you paid for. the sauce and cheese factors are surprisingly good for the price. the dough is a little doughy but they've been getting it crispier/thinner--probably bc of complaints by customers aaaaand bc if they make the pizzas thinner...they are using less dough....less money wasted.the slices are 99 cents of course and adding a topping costs 50 cents. an 18"" pie is like 8 or 9 bucks. a pepperoni large pie is like 10 or 11 dollars. all that said, these guys do a phenomenal job of keeping late night hunger in check for a few measly dollars outta your pockets. they provide a valuable (and valued) service to alphabet city where everything is becoming craft, local-, ""boojeee""...and EXPENSIVE. 'Sides sometimes you want a cheap food option during a draaaanks-a-thon. AND sometimes you'd rather have someone else make your food because you're afraid of thawing and warming up that 3 year-old Tombstone pizza in your freezer because it's icier than the Abominable Snowman! anyone want to buy that Tombstone frozen pizza from me? i'm putting it on Craiglist!F&F also serves wings, mozzarella sticks, jamaican patties with coco bread, and a few other small eats. prices on this stuff are pretty low. so expect the portions to be on the smaller side. just your normal selection of soft drinks and water to quench your thirst. no tap beverages. everything is bottles and cans. PRO TIP: Bring cash. the space itself is relatively clean though run down. you walk in. there's a small area to order. there are a few stools on either side of the entrance to sit and chomp and move on. you can't lolligag here...there's not enough space. the sodas etc. are to your right and the pizza oven is right behind the counter, so occasionally you will get the blast of heat when they open it. there's random signage etc. i actually don't think they take credit or debit here. all cash biz. IF you're past the age of 21 and don't carry at least an Andrew Jackson ($20) in your pocket (YOU HAVE LARGER PROBLEMS TO DEAL WITH...like where you went wrong in life.)the staff here is friendly-ish. they are not talkative. they smile, ask for your order, warm up some pizza, hand you your slices on a plate (or boxed and bagged to go), take your cash, and take the next customer's order. it's all rather pleasantly simple. NO SMALL TALK--which would delay me from my pizza gluttony. also if you had to deal with drunken buffoons as your cash cow clientele or cash herd...you wouldn't be too chatty either. the customer base: locals, people who pretend to be from EV/ABC, folks from other neighborhoods who like stumbling drunk on Ave C, and bridge-n-tunnelers are the constant flow of people. EDIT: and tipsy ladies who fall & break their heels in front of the pizza place are another valued customer at F&F.like i said before, if you are measuring F&F 99 cent as ""pizza"" against all the great sit-down pizza places in NYC...you're a fool or are as ""special"" as your parents and teachers told you growing up. yeah yeah i get it's not ""Famous Ray's, Ray's FameAss, Ray Jr's and the parade of other Rays."" and also, i get that it's not your artisanal pie that costs $20-30...that's a different category and class of pizza. and if that high-end stuff is all you eat...it's all good. eat what you want. just remember we all know you've downloaded the Dominos' app and have Papa John's on speed dial, so stfu re: hating on dollar pizza. however if you are looking for that melty gooey warm sauced-up dough known as ""cheap pizza"" then come on down as the PIZZA--err PRICE IS RIGHT at F&F.drops mic bc i just ordered a LARGE with PEPPERONI and SAUSEEEEGE!i out.zzz",54,0.9868

We had our office holiday party here (yes, I know bougie. My job is the greatest.) so my review is largely based on that experience. We did have another drink after the holiday party and were able to experience DI as non event guests too.The vibes are great. It is a traditional speakeasy with velvet curtains, leather couches, and fancy lighting. I remember walking in and being overwhelmed with how great the atmosphere is. Our part was in the space toward the back of the bar which really takes you back to another time period. DI is more than just a cool bar, it's an experience.The bartenders have fantastic personalities. (Maybe it was because we had a few of our own for the party?) You can tell that they are fun people who love to make drinks, It's only pitfall is that the cocktails are pretty average. They are good cocktails but are missing the element of a really refined craft cocktail. The Ideal Patriot was my favorite out of all the ones that I tried.I highly recommend DI if you're in the area.

There was a line all the way outside the door when we came here on a Saturday morning. My boyfriend tried a few of their tiny cupcakes and also a slice of their pecan pie. The cupcakes flavors he tried were the Brooklyn blackout, banana and PB fudge swirl. He loved them all, but his favorite was the Brooklyn blackout (he is a little bit of a choco-aholic).Definitely, come here if you are craving a little sweet something if you are in the area or make a trip to try some of their baked items.

Give them whatever you want, THEN get the ticket for the planetarium inside for $13.50. Better getting on line again than being ripped off, specially because the $13 price is written in small lettering on the bottom of the pamphlet of attractions. That's honestly kinda scam-y in my museum fanatic's opinion. I've always wanted to go, so yesterday I brought my little sister along. I was surprised by Hayden Planetarium. The show (Dark Universe) was better than I expected. It was actually pretty cool. It was half an hour long and worth it. I would come back.

Personally I do not eat pork or chicken but I do eat seafood so I was able to get a ramen with vegetable broth that had tempura shrimp. This place is more casual and cheaper than some of the other ramen places around. They have s good lunch special (ramen with fried rice or gyoza for $10) but we just ordered ramen. The service was fast and the portions are generous. I think the ramen was $11 and another 1.50 for the spicy sauce but it came with veggies, egg, and shrimp tempura.I would definitely come here next time I'm craving ramen and don't want to spend $20+ or wait for a while",42,0.961

Fries are good...onion rings are almost perfect. Bonus tip: find the self serve sauce counter. In a sauce cup, fill it half way with ketchup and then dump equal parts yellow mustard, Sriracha, and Tabasco until you fill it up. Dunk your fries in this and eat till you puke.

It's around the corner from her apartment, and it was a nice change from our usual weekend diner, formally a Viand's, on 86th and 2nd. The place is popping, with a fair ratio of the customers under the age of 3. (Heh.) We ordered our meals quickly, and we had them in ten minutes flat. I opted for the Pain Pedru (French toast) with fruit salad and crème fraîche. (Cafeteria fraaaîche! [""South Park"", anyone?]) What I love is that you only get one slice of bread, but is is wonderfully thick with a crunchy outside and a custardy center. The fruit salad was the perfect size and broke up the richness of the toast nicely. I wasn't a big fan of such a huge glob of crème fraîche on my toast, however. It was golfball-sized, no exaggeration. Eh. My aunt ordered a tartine with eggs, gruyere, and asparagus. I am not an egg fan on the whole, but I took a bite and I easily could have eaten the entire thing! The eggs were a perfect scrambled consistency, the cheese and asparagus flavors really shined. Afterwards, we both went to the pastry counter and drooled over some of the wonderfully crafted confections. Their eclairs looked amazing, though my stomach was too full to enjoy one. Well, there is always next time! This is a wonderful addition to this part of the U.E.S. I can't wait to come back for more, and I'll be sure to save room for a pastry next time!",29,0.9959

It seems like everything someone working in the industry would want in a restaurant. The chef/owner came from a top NYC hotel, and clearly has poured his heart and his expertise into every inch of this restaurant.Interior: Taking a walk around each room was beautiful and inviting. Clean, and filled with intricate details.The lounge in the front serves both the bar and the formal dining menu. The formal dining area has a mixture of wood table tops cozy seating, and gorgeous custom designed leather chairs. With dim lights during dinner, custom designed table settings, a wine room, private dining rooms, and a barn in the middle this is one of the most elegant modern rustic spaces in New York City. Event Space:There was a beautiful event space upstairs with windows that spanned across the length of the dining room. Hard woods and rustic modern through out. The floor to ceiling windows looked down on the formal dining room and the top of the barn.Private Dining:In the basement there is a wine cellar with a long table perfect for a private dinner for business or family and friends.Thankfully the food was equally as creative, interesting, and each dish we tried was delicious. Gnosh:The roasted kale salad with acorn butternut squash was good. If I had not had lunch earlier I would have gone for the Maine Lobster salad... And several other starters. The Buttermilk dressing on the kale was nice and light. I tend to ask for dressing on the side but somehow forgot and thankfully this dish was well balanced as we're all of the other item we ordered. The bone marrow with Manila clams was mouthwatering. Herb crusted with lemon and shallot reduction, perfectly executed. If you're craving savory this is a great dish not to miss.The butternut squash ravioli was one of the most spectacular butter nut squash ravioli I have ever had ... Instead of being flat, the ravioli look like a present. Wrapped perfectly for the winter months. If you are vegan or vegetarian this is a great dish to order you won't be disappointed.My friend had the BBQ beef ribs with crispy shoe string fries which were delicious. The spicy bread sticks I wanted to take home with me they were not too spicy and perfectly baked.Dessert:Home made sorbets are to die for, and so are the delicious fresh donuts. Soft and warm, cooked to order, and certainly not too big.

We came here for a birthday celebration and the 10 of us sat at the back table. Service was pretty good and there were probably 2-3 different waiters attending us.For appetizers we got:TRECOLORI: cured meats and cheeses (how was this $18, so small)FRITTO MISTO: fried medly of calamari, shrimp, zucchini (ok I guess... best one out of the 3)CLASSICO: assortment of eggplant, mushroom, clam, shrimp (weird, did not like)My take on appetizers is that they're a trap. Restaurants love it when diners order appetizers because it gives them more time to prepare the entree and makes it appear that food came out more quickly. Also, they're relatively the same price if not more than pasta entrees.. In that case, get me pasta for appetizer. Now for the main event:LINGUINE NERE: squid ink linguine with mussels, shrimp, scallops, clams, and squid in marinaraCALAMARI ALLA LUCINA: fresh sauteed squid over risottoThe squid ink linguine is the clear winner. It was served with a generous portion of seafood and the flavor was spot on. My only complaint is that the mussels weren't cleaned out well so I kept on eating sand........

531,24,8,4.0,"Here are the top 5 reasons I love Stube.1. I developed a taste for cheddar brats and currywurst during a trip to Munich/Vienna a few years ago, and never could find a quick takeout spot in NYC to fill the void. This is particularly useful since Wechsler's Currywurst in the East Village closed last December.2. Stube is on my way home from the subway, on what is becoming one of the best blocks for food/drink on the Upper East Side (see also: Bondurants, Five Mile Stone, 2 Little Red Hens, and iconic Heidelberg).3. NYC as a whole needs more current weeknight dinner takeout spots that aren't $15. My cucumber salad + brat came out to a cool $10 and change.4. I love that Stube celebrates the German heritage of 20th century Yorkville, instead of trying to latch on to trends. They modernized something of their own.5. THE FOOD. The German cucumber salad was perfect, with equal parts sweetness and acidity, and the flavor of onion without the actual pieces of onion. The cheddar brat with Stube sauce is a winner too. You can mix and match your brat, sauces, and toppings, but I liked it simple. I also liked the buttery brioche Balthazar bun, which was flaky, but strong enough to hold the brat. I thought I would have wanted the squishy potato bun, but I have to say, this is reminiscent of pigs in a blanket, in the absolute best possible way.",27,0.9885

The Spicy Thai definitely wins on flavor because of the peanut dressing and apricot-sriracha glazed tempeh (WHAT? yeah you heard me, apricot-sriracha).

The dining experience is so social, so I can't help but think other diners are whispering about my loser qualities when I dine by myself. It's not like I notice or judge other people for dining solo (in fact, they go up on the coolness scale), but I can't seem to shake off that insecurity. Ramen shops, though, are the exception. They're quick, there's almost always space for a solo diner at the counter, and in the case of Nishida Sho-ten, the food is quite good and has that Japanese ramen-ya feel. I usually go for traditional bowls of ramen, but after seeing pictures of their tan tan men, I just had to get it. The miso and chicken broth was very savory and rich, though it was lacking in spice. I didn't mind this, but it's something to consider if you do want spice. The broth delightfully clung to the wavy, thick noodles and the toppings of bok choy and bean sprouts balanced the bowl out wonderfully. I liked the broth so much that on my second visit I tried the tan tan men hiyashi chuka, a cold ramen dish often served in the summer. The hiyashi chuka had cold tomatoes in addition to the toppings found in the hot ramen bowl. Unfortunately, in its cold form, the broth was too heavy and sweet. I was also surprised by the amount of cold broth in the bowl because hiyashi chuka typically only contains a broth that lightly dresses the noodles. Service was prompt and very attentive, and I did appreciate having my water glass filled consistently despite how busy it was. -Ramen was pretty reasonable for the amount served (~$10-$13). -Credit card minimum of $20-Free kaedama (second serving of noodles) after 11pm dailyLikelihood of another visit:I would like to try their hot tan tan men again!!",25,0.98

Come very hungry. In fact last time I came after a half marathon ... power move.3) Come back before estimated seating time:Come back before your estimated time because I have found that the wait is usually shorter as people tend to be put off by the long estimated wait time and bail. Make sure you listen closely as they call numbers because I am pretty sure the number callers are also auctioneers on the side. 4) Ride the magic carpet upstairsOnce you are called it is time to get excited for your magical escalator ride up to the magical dim sum room. First impression is ""WOWZA this place is massive!"". Second thought is ""Hmm, I wonder if this place moonlights as a casino?"" Everything from the elaborate design to the ""Cashier"" sign tells me this is definitely the case. Third thought is ""holy crap everything smells good and I am hungry""5) Wait for your card and tea:You sit, you receive tea and a car ...

My favourite as a child was Sea Shore, a staple after all of my big school events, where my family and I enjoyed broiled lobsters and snow crab legs. As I got older, my friends and I would go down to Tony's Pier or Johnny's Reef at the very tip of the island and order up some fried shrimp and strawberry daiquiris. During my time working in the Bronx, we would take lunch trips to Seafood City for henny coladas and seafood platters. Now, I go to Archie's Tap and Table (formerly known as Sugar and Spice) for some very well-prepared local eats, paying homage to my elevated palate. City Island is a great destination if you're trying to be active. You can easily bike, jog or walk here from Co-op City, Pelham Bay Park or any of the surrounding areas. That makes for a fulfilling day out and about.",32,0.9765
543,21,12,4.0,"I think Nitecap is becoming one of my favorite LES drinking spots. Great atmosphere, creative and original cocktails menu and very well-made cocktails concocted and served by friendly wait staff/bartenders. Already made two visits within the month and have recommended to others to check out this very cool bar. It is never too crowded, even on a Friday night. Wait for a table is usually no more than 15-30 minutes, if you are lucky, but the bar is always a great place to see bartenders in action. Especially within the LES, I am tired of going into mediocre bars only to have some awful drinks, standing or sitting amongst a crazy crowd, so Nitecap just fits the bill for a nice, chill but fun evening.I have been to a share of many cocktail bars in the city, and Nitecap certainly stood out for me. The drinks are just all great, and their cocktails menu is rather extensive. Regarding atmosphere, it is a mix of intimate yet chill. The space is not large. It definitely permeates the right vibe for a date, though you can certainly entertain a small group of friends here. Their menu is super creative, and whomever designed their menu, I have to commend them for a great job. The names are fun and original. The ingredients for their cocktails are very unique blends. The menu also nicely describes the ingredients and categorizes what type of drink, so you aren't spending time guessing. So far though, I have not been disappointed. And with names like 'Simply Irresistible' or 'Cuddle Buddy', it is hard to say no to a lot. Some cocktails off the list, worth highlighting from my first two visits -- Mr. Roboto ($16; Nikka Coffee Grain Whisky, Sherry, Amaro Cio Ciaro, Lemon Juice), Simply Irresistible ($14; Old Forester Bourbon, Lustau Amontillado Sherry, Amaro Montenegro, Lemon Juice, Cucumber), Cat Video ($15; Kappa Pisco, Singani 63, Creme Yvette, Lemon and Lime juices, Egg White), Cuddle Buddy ($15; Plantation Original Dark Rum, Lustau Solera Reserve Brandy de Jerez, Grand Marnier, Cinnamon, Cream), and Total Recall ($14; Dorothy Parker Gin, Cocchi Rosa, Strawberry, Absinthe). Nitecap is certainly worth the visit if you are venturing through the LES neighborhood. The combination of their atmosphere, service, and drinks really makes for a solid cocktail bar/speakeasy without being over the top. If you want a nice casual bar, with drinks that will not disappoint, no matter what you order, Nitecap will certainly do the job.",23,0.9985

The only thing that sucked was having no signal at some spots.I had couple of the Food Bank Special: vodka with OJ. The food was pretty good too, the chicken fingers were hot and crunchy. The mini cheese burgers were ok. Definitely a big shout out to all the staff. They were so nice and caring. Even though I was all the way in the back, they came and check on us every 15 minutes or so, and brought us food.I didn't stay for long cause I had a flight to catch. But this place is cool!

It's not the most authentic Cuban I've eaten, but I'm a harsh judge because my best friend's father is Cuban and can cook his ass off. That said it was well seasoned and nicely presented. I had the Chicken with Garlic. Whoa. It's like they know me. It's a lot of garlic. A LOT, exactly how I like it. I chose the yellow rice hoping it would have bits of veg in it but it was just plain yellow rice. But once I mixed it with the garlic sauce, it was plenty flavorful. The chicken was a little well done and I wish it had more crispy bits. The crispy bits were guuud. I wouldn't recommend the Pina Colada only because it's kinda small and I couldn't taste the rum at all. So once the dessert menu came, I was drawn to the spiked coffee. Oh yeah.... this was where they were hiding my alcohol! It was like caramel-y Ethanol. And it paired well with the flan because they had similar flavor profiles. It's been a long time since I've used flavor profiles in a sentence... I would easily do this again after a show if I was in the mood for something packed with flavor, and coffee I could literally set on fire.",27,0.951

They give New Yorkers exactly what they want a big slice of pizza for a fair price and something that is unique.Also as you guessed it in the name this pizza shop is known for their Artichoke pizza slices at $5 a slice which may seem steep but its large enough to be a meal and worth it. After a night of drinking regardless of the night of the week and you are by an artichoke pizza or live by one you are thinking of getting one late after a night out.

547,26,16,4.0,"After constantly seeing two hands on my instagram and how dreamy the place looked with cute mason jar cups and fancy acai bowls. I finally made the trip down here one day. The place definitely reached all my expectations, It was definitely beautiful inside and bigger than what I expected it to be. However, I thought it was a place were you order at the counter and bring it to a table but its not. You do get a server. Unfortunately, our server was not nice. She saw that we were having a nice conversation with the people next to us and kept coming back a lot to take our order. It wasn't crowded so I felt like she didn't need to rush us. When she took our order for juice and we had questions to ask, she didn't know and felt annoyed when asked her. Also, a minute after we ordered our juice my friend got up to go speak with her to change our order and the server rolled her eyes at my friend. At the end of our meal, she tried to make up by being nice after she saw how unhappy we were with her attitude. Like no honey, you already ruined it. The juice and the bowl were like half full when we got them. The juice is mostly foam with juice at the bottom. But since I'm guessing its cold pressed and it could have been more. The flavor we got was pineapple, apple, cucumber, and mint. It was very tart and not sweet which I liked. The acai bowl was absolutely delicious, a little on the small side but still very good. I would be giving it 3 starts if there were similar places in New York City, but since Two Hands is different and does offer a nice experience I'll give it 4.",29,0.7231

The location is superbly clean and even boasts a free lemon water station as well as a bathroom. On a nice day, you will find the place packed but that only means you can have a seat in the rear patio area. Sweet!You can order a custom salad but in all honesty they have some pretty awesome combinations to choose from, so why not take a chance? I thoroughly enjoy their Gone Fishing salad as it literally came with tuna, salmon, tilapia, shrimp, romaine lettuce, roasted red peppers, cheddar & mozzarella cheese, and corn salsa. Even though they were out of the corn salsa, they gladly offered to substitute with any item of my choosing (got the chopped cucumbers). Be prepared to eat well because their portions are quite filling.

It has a housemade griddled corn bread, slow-roasted berkshire pork, poached farm fresh eggs and chipotle hollandaise sauce. The first bite was amazing, filled with flavors. However, the corn bread got too soggy a little later. I heard the Chorizo Benedict was also good, I might try it next time. Service: was awesome! Upbeat and friendly servers, who brought the next round of drinks before we could even finish the first round. So I had to keep up with the pace of the servers haha.

554,35,37,4.0,"Literally two seconds after we stepped inside Gotham West Market and my companion left to find the bathroom, the gentleman behind the Ample Hills counter placed a generous sample spoon in front of my face. ""Here,"" he said, ""try this. It's called The Dude - and it's delicious."" I needed no further encouragement and promptly plopped the spoonful in my mouth, and basked in how beautifully the taste of Irving Farm espresso, Stumptown Coffee liquor, vodka, and White Russian ice cream melded together. And if that weren't enough, he immediately proceeded to give me an even larger sample spoon of ""The Hell's Kitchen Sink"", proudly noting that it was a flavor unique to the pop-up's location.Aside from the fact that the way to my heart is clearly through my stomach [1], I've nursed an ongoing infatuation with Ample Hills since I first sampled their flavors nearly a year ago. I can't fail to mention the Salted Crack Caramel, which is the one flavor I get, without fail, each and every time I visit. After all, could anyone resist the addictive pairing of salted butter caramel ice cream dispersed with pieces of Deb's Famous Crack Cookies (saltine crackers coated with butter, sugar, and chocolate)? It's nearly impossible to go wrong with any of their other flavors either, like The Raw Deal (perfect for cookie dough lovers), The Ooey Gooey Butter Cake (hello, St. Louis-style butter cake), and The Snap, Mallow, Pop (your favorite Rice Krispies in ice cream form).But let's not forget about The Hell's Kitchen Sink, the flavor that can be found only at the Gotham West pop-up. There's the starting Guinness dark chocolate ice cream base, interspersed with spiced brownies, a brown-butter cookie dough, and crumbled toffee bars. It seems overwhelming at first blush, but the ice cream base is mildly sweetened and earthy, with the subtle Guinness undernote present within each spoonful. It's highlighted subtly with an edge of spice, the crisp bite of caramel, and the nostalgic pieces of cookie dough; it's indeed a creation worthy of the location it's named after.Since the pop-up is housed within Gotham West Market, seating is usually readily available and there's a full array of additional vendors to explore. Perhaps the only negative I can think of is how far they're located from the subway, but... well, think of it as a small burden to compensate for the extra indulgence of sugar. ;)--[1] Who says girls can't have the same weaknesses as guys?",46,0.8173

For those of you who don't already know, Taïm means ""tasty"" in Hebrew, and the restaurant lives up to its name.We ordered a few falafel sandwiches and fried eggplant. After waiting in line in the crowded store for about 10 minutes, we placed our order and waited another 10 before getting it to go. I am no noob when it comes to falafel in the City. My most-frequented falafel establishment is Mamouns and they make a mean falafel sandwich, but Taïm is something completely different. I don't know whether or not it is an Israeli-style or just this restaurant's style, but the falafels were lighter, fresher, less greasy. The sandwich had more fresh fixins' in it, making it seem like a more lightweight, healthier version, albeit bigger in size.The fried eggplant was out of this world, and had a great dipping sauce.It's a little more expensive than mamouns, but the sandwiches are bigger, the falafels are fried to order, and you get to avoid St Marks.

Very satisfying. It may look like small portions but it definitely fills you up and the ramen broth is pretty well done and flavorful with tender pork chasu. Also went with pork cha sui buns. Tender cha sui with cucumbers and daikon with a nice hoi sin sauce. The bao's were a great appetizer.

From 5pm to 8pm, they have $1 oysters, every day.I ordered the $45 Combo B (1 lb king crab with 1/2 lb shrimp). I mixed the sauces Classic Cajun and Garlic Butter - which I found out from the waitress that you can do but you can't order the Cajun Spice with the Garlic Oil sauce - on side - it costs $4 extra. Weird. What the hell, so I mixed it and it was finger lickin' good. You can also pick how spicy - mild, spicy, or bomb spicy. I got spicy and I thought it needed a little more kick to be spicy. But my friend got mild and he thought it was too spicy so it all depends on your spice tolerance.My friends ordered the $40 Combo A (1 lb lobster with 1/2 lb of shrimp) and $29 Combo C (1 lb snow crab with 1/2 lb of shrimp)Loved the decor.

Because of this, we were ample to sample many items amongst the three of us. We opted for a bowl of gaucamole, Taquitos San Andres, and Tostadas de Carne. The gauc was on point, coming with both chips and a side of housemade tiny blue corn tortillas. I could have consumed a few baskets of those! (I LOVE corn tortillas.) The taquitos boasts some succulent carnitas. The tostadas definitely have a kick to them; they aren't joking about the shredded beef being habanero spiked! As far as drinks so, I can vouch for both the mango (which I stole some sips of), and the frozen rosalita, which gave me the perfect post-work buzz. The bartenders were quite personable and awesome as well, though I'm glad they weren't quite persuasive enough to make me get a second drink.

Plus, as the owners are Swedish, they offer tasty and real (meaning, not processed) pastry options. My personal favorites are the Swedish Raspberry Biscuit and the Swedish Chocolate Ball (which amazingly does not have any sugar added, but tastes great).And, on top of all that, the lobby of the office building that the coffee stand is in, is beautiful and has several couch benches and tables that you can sit at and enjoy your coffee.Really unique space, location and coffee, and beats going to a run-of-the-mill Starbucks.",18,0.9935

566,17,22,4.0,"If you don't like this place, something is wrong with you. Or else you just might not be from NY. Thus you don't remember this city as a place that had bars that were actually affordable. There was more than just fancy mixed drinks with exotic liquors you've never heard of. The food menus didn't have to be designed by a chef who has appeared on the Food Network. The bar might not even be clean, but it was homey just the same. That's the NY I'm from, and it's the same NY that Corner Bistro is from.Corner Bistro is always packed at night. An old school atmosphere, experienced bartenders/waitstaff and plenty of regulars are 3 big reasons; pricing is yet another. A McSorley's beer here costs $3. The rest of the beers here also go for low prices; note I'm not talking happy hour, I'm talking all the time. This makes Corner Bistro an ideal watering hole for the cash strapped. The burger here is a basic bar burger brought to its highest expression. Well seasoned meat, cooked fresh to order, and to the requested doneness (never had an overcooked burger here). Your burger will be greasy, slathered in American cheese, and on a basic bun. It will seem out of place in the West Village food scene nowadays, and I for one believe that is a good thing. It could be the best burger you've had in awhile (was my first time), it may not be the absolute best ever (also true for me), but it is a thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying meal. Fries are extra ($2.75), but given what the Bistro Burger costs ($9.75) I cannot see anyone ever raising that as an issue. The grilled cheese is also very good here, but I could never pick it over the burger (blasphemy).If you don't get this place, then good. Stick to your $20+ burgers with beef flown in from Argentina, topped with ground civet coffee and Cambodian breast milk cheese.

Around 8:45 we checked in with the hostess to see how much longer and she told us about 30 minutes which made no sense because we already waited 30 min. We brought this up to her and she said that there's nothing she can do about it because ""this happens every night"". After we complained to her she told us she would seat us next which took about 10-15 min. Now the good part. The calamari ($7) we got was very soft and you could tell it's fresh. It was a decently sized portion, especially for the price. I got the Gorgonzola and pear ravioli ($9) which was absolutely delicious.

It's very similar to airport security complete with a full body scanner and X-ray machine. You do not however have to take your shoes off. Be warned, like a plane you cannot bring liquids in (lots of people were disposing of bottles of water).Once you enter it goes from a very bright setting to a very dim one as you are greeted by a GIGANTIC screen that gives you information about the building including how many visitors have been there and from where. From there you go through a hallway that has bedrock embedded in the walls with a video discussing construction of the building. You can actually reach out and touch the rock which is cool.

My ears popped three times! Never mind that however because on the way up the elevators put on an amazing show. Yes that's right, the *elevators* put on a show. Every wall in the elevator is really an LCD screen tied to a presentation. As you go up it is as if you are moving through the history of New York City (complete with a year counter in the corner) and you see the city rise up around you as you go up. If you're afraid of heights this may not be for you but I thought it was amazing.Once you exit you are ushered into a long room with a big screen. A video about New York City is played for you and then suddenly the entire screen lifts up and you are greeted with the sky! It's a very dramatic presentation and everyone clapped and gasps were heard throughout the room. It was a gorgeous presentation. After that my group was let loose to explore.There are two floors were you can drink in views. The 102nd floor is the highest, but the floor below is also great for views. You can get some amazing pictures but be warned if it's foggy (as it was the day I went) your views will be limited. All that said, there is nothing like seeing New York City from so high up. Even better, you can walk around in a circle to get views in all directions. On one side you'll see the Brooklyn Bridge, on another you see New Jersey. The word breathtaking barely does the view justice.A neat feature is the ""Sky Portal"", a platform where screens below show you the street scene below you, simulating what it would look like if you were floating high above the city. it was super fun.There is also a series of LCD screens arranged in a circle to facilitate a presentation about New York City run by the staff. No matter who you are the presenter makes you an ""honorary New Yorker"" which is cute. Near that display is the gift shop. The prices aren't cheap so if you're going to shop there get ready to burn some cash.There are rest rooms for folks to use and they were clean and well maintained. Staff is constantly in maintenance mode here so that is hardly a surprise.When you take the elevator down gives you a completely different presentation which is cool to see and yes, your ears will pop again.This was a great experience, but be warned there's a $32 price tag per person to get in so budget accordingly. Still, if you love New York City (or amazing views) you owe it to yourself to experience this at least once in your life.",31,0.9983
570,12,9,4.0,"I tried the Bamberg here and fell in love. So delicious.The Bamberg has chicken, cucumbers, and dijon mustard. You'd think that this is just a normal sandwich, but it's not. The chicken is fried to perfection. It's so juicy, thin, and flavorful. The cucumbers and mustard are the perfect combination to have with the chicken. The bread is just okay, but I am too focused on the rest of the sandwich anyway. Yum!If you don't like cucumbers or dijon mustard, try the Sweet Onion sandwich which has cabbage and a tzatziki sauce instead. This one is delicious as well, but IMO the Bamberg is better.",19,0.9849
571,15,11,4.0,"A sunny, cozy Israeli-ish spot with a broad menu of mezze, sandwiches, soups, entrees, and drinks. There are more than 12 chairs here--it's not a tiny place, though it has the feel of one, and it has room for groups. In warmer weather, the storefront opens up and it all feels light and airy. I've been here a couple of times and ordered or shared a fair amount of things, and I wasn't taking notes so I'm a little blurry on details. The summary, however, is that I liked just about everything, and got the impression that there wasn't anything especially bad to order. Details remembered:- They mix a hard-boiled egg into their guacamole--this is both unexpected and delicious.- I first came to try the Israeli breakfast, which is usually combination of eggs, an Israeli salad (tomato, cucumber, a bit of onion, mint and parsley or in any case some sort of herb, dressed in oil or maybe yogurt), bread, some feta, maybe olives, maybe a few other things. At 12 Chairs, those other things include teeny dipping bowls of labneh (strained yogurt), guacamole, remarkably salty cilantro-pesto, and tunafish salad. So, it's a little quirky, as far as the classic dish goes, but still satisfying.- Soup! I tried the borscht and the Yemenite soups. The borscht was basically a hearty vegetable soup, heavy on tomato flavor but a bit too light on the beet flavor. (This is partly personal bias, I like my borscht light on the tomato, heavy on the beet.) The Yemenite soup is a spicy Chicken soup and though it wasn't bad, it was a bit boring, and I'd skip it if only because there are better things to be had at 12 Chairs.- The sandwiches are large, you could easily split one between two people so's to have more room for mezze or dessert. I tried a nice grilled vegetable sandwich and the chicken sandwich. Both solid-to-good.- Hummus, falafel, Israeli pickles... all excellent and all as you would expect. If you crave these things, you'll be happy with them here.- For dessert, the 12 Chairs Blintz is great, but note they're presented more like crepes than like blintzes, fanned out folded triangles, very lightly filled. I was hoping for the traditional fat rolled-up blintzes stuffed full of sweet cheese. Still, we loved the dish, which comes sided and topped with fresh fruit and toasted walnuts, cream, and chocolate drizzle.",17,0.9962
572,12,7,4.0,"What a great find next to Port Authority! Definitely come to Bea for the amazing drinks and charming decor. It's a great place for a girl's night out or catching up with friends.They have delicious girly cocktails, broken down in liquor categories, that pleases everyone. Since I love my gin, I adored Over the Moon - rosemary infused aviation gin with aperol, lime juice, and orange san pelligrino. As one can probably imagine, it is citrusy, bubbly, sweet, and VERY STRONG and delicious. My friends each got a drink in the vodka & whiskey section, and are also pleased. While the drinks and delicious and well-crafted, I'll also point out that they're the same price (or more expensive) than some plates. Oh well, a girl's gotta have her tasty cocktail with her meal.Their menu is strangely organized and scattered as they are all small bites, more like tapas. The heartier fare are collected on one page while the lighter fare on the other. I had the shrimp toast and roasted beet salad, in which the former are two satisfying bites and the latter refreshing and lightly dressed. Other plates include Uncle Tommy's Pie (hearty) and Green Pasta (creamy, perfectly al-dente noodles).Ambiance is very cute and charming. They have exposed brick walls, and they play old movies on them. There are plenty of dim lighting, candles, and cozy seats.They also have an open air atrium/patio in the back, which was closed when I visited due to weather, but I would imagine it to be lovely on a summer night.Highly recommend! And of course - make reservations if you want a seat instead of the bar area.",18,0.9929

The first time we came there were probably only two other groups of 3-4ppl in the entire place. We sat at the bar to watch the baseball game and the bartender was very nice. He even gave us a couple shots to try that were flavored in house. My boyfriend loves their mojitos and said it was the best one he'd ever had. If I had written my review after this night I'd say it was a chill super themed place to grab a drink and chill.So we went back on another night and it was crazy packed, I mean seriously you had to be touching someone to be inside. This time it totally was like the gay bars I've been to; just totally fun, lots of dancing and energy. A full 180 from our initial visit.All-in-all I really like their drinks, food and the place as a whole. The only reason I can't get myself to give it five stars is because it isn't consistent on what to expect on a given night. but if you don't care either way, then hey, this is definitely a place for you to check out on whatever night.",19,0.9028
574,6,5,4.0,Every day gourmet is a 24 hour deli located in between 40th and 41st on Lexington Avenue. First I have to tell you that every day gourmet has every thing that you could imagine food wise. If you are one of those people that cannot decide on what they want to have for lunch today come to this place and you will find something that will fill your stomach up. From the outside every day gourmet does not look like much boy was I wrong. When I say that every day gourmet deli has everything it literally has everything. They have a salad and fruit bar that is huge you cannot tell what's on the other end of the salad and fruit bar that's how long it is. In the back of every day gourmet they have an entire pizza station where there are pizzas that you can purchase as well as slices to go. They have a make your own salad station with a guy that stands behind the counter and you can create whatever type of salad that you want. Their salad station kind of remind me of a subway chain restaurant where you can just pick whatever you want and the worker will put everything together for you. The guy that was behind the counter had a very good memory because when I ordered my food I told him what I wanted and it was not on the menu and he remembered everything I asked for on my sandwich. To the left of the salad station they have a cold cut and hot sandwich station. They do serve boars head cold cuts here and you can get a hot sandwich or a cold sandwich. Their hot sandwich as well as their cold sandwich menu is very extensive. I ended up getting a grilled chipotle chicken wrap with lettuce and cheese. My wrap was very good. They had a lot of different types of grilled marinated chicken they had grilled marinated steak in teriyaki sauce and sweet Thai chili sauce. This deli also had cheeseburgers and gyros. I was really amazed at the selection that they had at gourmet deli. What I also like about this location is they are very close to Grand Central Station but there is also a Dunkin donuts across the street after I get my food I can go to the Dunkin' Donuts get my hot tea and then I can take the train. Overall I highly recommend coming every day gourmet it's very close to Grand Central Station the prices here are not bad and they do have one of the biggest selections I have seen in the deli in a very long time whether you're very health conscious or you want to eat something that will stick to your ribs I really think that every day gourmet will suit your needs for hunger. PROS: - Close to Grand Central Station- huge variety of food- they have a salad station- they have one of the biggest fruit bars I've seen in Manhattan,14,0.9803

The other day I was sitting waiting for my order and there were 18 men waiting around for their food. Mind you, the place is a tiny little place so I was basically surrounded by a ton of men. Oh, it's raining men, hallelujah! It's raining men, AMEN! Now for the food, it is near where I work. Is there places with better curry, yes but I do not have the time to travel far during lunch. I even like my own Japanese curry better but that is not the point. Go! Go! Curry is not super expensive like the other places near the WTC area and it is filling. That is all I need when it comes to food for lunch. Is it a satisfying portion with a price that is good for the portion size and quick, yes, then it fits the bill. The katsu is not dry.

576,13,11,4.0,"Stew's and I go way back - I remember as a kid driving from the Bronx to their store in Norwalk, CT and being amazed by all the interactive stuff around the store I could bring to life with the press of a button. When the Yonkers location opened in the late 90s Stew's became a more regular place for me, and as an adult I realized how awesome this place is. First off, how great is the location? Right off I-87, it's easily accessible from the north and the south - plus it's housed with a Costco and Home Depot below it and Ridge Hill shopping mall on the other side of the highway. Stew's has a large selection, though one can argue they don't carry every product one would regularly food-shop for. There are no aisles, you simply shop as you walk through the store. Their strengths are definitely meat, seafood, and dairy - and they also have good produce and deli sections; their hot buffet has a large selection as well. I may get some gripe for this but I don't think they have the best bakery; I find most of Stew's baked goods taste very processed, more comparable to Entenmann's than an in-house bakery. There are always a ton of free samples throughout the store, you can definitely skip lunch and nosh away at the samples.Stew's is more than just food, though - they do a lot beyond the main store. Before you hit the food there's a huge outdoor area they use for seasonal products. In the spring/summer they sell flowers, pumpkins in the fall, and Christmas trees in the winter. They also have an outdoor food court seasonally which serves barbecue-style food. There's a petting zoo and a wine shop as well. My favorite ""extra"" though is the ice cream counter - if you spend over $100 in the store (which I usually do) you get a free cup or cone. I really don't think I've ever paid for ice cream at Stew's - it's a great perk I hope they don't stop it!Stew's definitely made it's mark in NY - I don't come here too often but when I do it's never a disappointment.",15,0.9955

578,14,11,4.0,"The Handpulled Noodle is a legit spot that just opened up a couple blocks from my house in West Harlem (/Hamilton Heights, depending on whom you ask) nearest the 1 train, easily accessible by the ABCD.A great location, near a park and bars so you can carb-up before you liquor-up! It runs about 10$/pp and really is enough for two meals though I doubt anyone can put the chopsticks down once you start digging in. They offer fare for omni's and vegans alike. I was surprised to learn they carry seitan, which is a wonderful variation away from simply just veggies or tofu. Their noodles are (of course) naturally fresh, and have an amazing chewy texture you miss in prepackaged noodles. My favorite here is the seitan and veggie stirfry with ribbon noodles which is perfectly balanced between spice and saltiness. The cumin seitan isn't anything to write home about, however. They also have scallion pancakes, which I didn't really enjoy but Thrilla seemed to like.It's a small place, with some seating so grab one quick if you can (unless you see The Vanilla Gorilla standing behind you, then save me a seat instead!) but don't ABSOLUTELY plan on eating here unless you're fine with waiting 5-10 minutes. There's a lovely park a block away, enjoy it by the water if the weather is nice! But as they say here, eat as soon as possible as fresh noodles can become soggy and lose their texture relatively quickly.I am trying to get the owner to bring in some miso soup broth so I can try those, so we will see how that goes! Maybe when / if they do I can add another star!

579,14,7,4.0,"My new favorite place to order from.... The primo panini is really good. It doesn't come on what you would consider panini bread. It's more like actual bread, not the thinner and flimsier bread typically used at a deli or diner for example. It has steak, sliced mozzarella, tomato, arugula, basil, and portobello mushrooms. The steak isn't the best steak ever but it's only $13!!! I usually stay away from anything green, but I have a newfound appreciation for arugula now. Ok... The fries. You can either have greens (ew) or fries on the side. I'm not really a fan of either but these fries are SO GOOD!! They aren't the thin rectangular kind of fries you usually get on the side. They're also not ""curly fries"" although they are curly. They're cut thicker and they're a medium brown color, not a light yellow. Next time I will take pictures of this beautiful panini/fries combination. Which will be very soon. Probably tomorrow. Moving on to the grilled salmon wrap. Aside from the obvious salmon, it has fresh spinach, roasted peppers, avocado, and balsamic vinaigrette. Also comes with either fries or salad. It was pretty good. I ate half (it comes as a hot wrap), and then the rest later after it was in the fridge for a while. Not sure if I liked it better hot or cold. Bland, but I kind of like bland food sometimes (is that weird?)  2018 UPDATE:Tried the veggie wrap today and it's good and a little spicy because of the mayo. I was pretty hungry and kind of wish I had gotten two wraps and no side. I opted for the mashed potatoes as a side since it was a free add-on and not all of them were (some were $4) but I like mashed potatoes so I didn't mind. They of course came with gravy on the side or I would've been very disappointed. Everything I previously posted is still true to this day, although maybe after ordering the primo panini so many times, the steak is sometimes fattier than others and I don't like the fat because of the texture.

This class is great for those of us that need that harder something extra to get our tummy muscles (as well as every last effing muscle strand in our body) stronger and tighter. The teachers know what they're doing and I love that they come around to make sure we are doing proper form to help prevent injury. I am five classes in at this point in time and even though I still suck, I'm starting to notice I suck just a tiny bit little less each time.One of my favorite things about this class is that you can buy packages of classes and you just need to use them up within a certain amount of time. You can make your own schedule (depending on availability) online and their website makes it so easy to book or cancel. With classes maxing out at 11 people in most cases, you will need to plan ahead but it's not that hard at all.

Lined with bars that are all some blend of fratty and creepy, this area tends to be a disappointment on most nights. But not to fear, Upper West-Siders! Dead Poet is a diamond in the rough here. Here are my notes:-Wonderful and friendly staff. Most of the nights I have come here (including last night), the place has been packed. But the bartenders, with their Usain Bolt-like speed, manage to serve you pretty quickly, even if you order one of their signature cocktails-FREE POPCORN. Okay, I almost never eat it, but if I'm somewhere in between tipsy and drunk, I like to know that it's there, waiting for me, like a trusty pet or a whipped significant other.-Beer and whiskey selection is solid.-Everything here, as you could imagine, is poet-themed. The decor, the drinks, the table adornments, everything. -So onto the drinks: Though these aren't the most elegant cocktails I've ever had, they're really tasty and tend to pack a punch. The drink menu changes occasionally, but my go-to girly cocktail here is the Walt Whitman (Lemon vodka, gin, coconut rum, and orange liqueur). Don't get this if you're not about sweets - really really sugary. Last night I also got the Dorothy Parker (Gin, Aperol, Punt E Mes and a dash of chili powder). Quite different from the Walt Whitman (as you'd expect, given the chili powder), but equally good. I have an affinity for spicy gin drinks, so I'd be remiss if I didn't try this one out.-Ambiance: Much cozier and typically more low key than the rest of the bars on Amsterdam. It can definitely get rowdy at times (especially when Columbia students venture down on Thursday-Saturday nights), but never overwhelmingly so. It's smaller than a lot of the other bars in the area as well, so overall it's a relatively chill establishment. Also a note: A+ on the music. There's jukebox that I'd suggest taking advantage of - great selection, and tunes from any era you can think of.

But cut me some slack; as someone who spent the last three years calling this place my office, it should be a given.As with any long-term relationship, there have been highs and lows, and an endless number of changes. When I first started working here in the summer of 2012, the venue was still deemed the World Financial Center (WFC) and the first facades of construction were underway. Businesses started to close (a process that wasn't helped by Hurricane Sandy in fall of 2013) and construction barrier after barrier was put up in preparation for a complete overhaul. When it was officially renamed Brookfield Place, I watched as the luxury stores started to open, Hudson Eats and Le District transformed into dining staples, and the passageway connecting to the World Trade Center PATH was completed.I have yet to find another venue like it in the city. It's a space that's actually welcoming for tourists and visitors, offering free WiFi, a myriad of seating, shopping, and dining options, and a gorgeous waterfront view bordering the Battery Park City Esplanade. You'll occasionally find art exhibitions, performances, and even concerts being held intermittently throughout the year as well; keep an eye on the Brookfield Place website for details on events. And although the Winter Gardens are only a shadow of what it used to be, there's something inexplicably calming about sitting under the foliage of a handful of palm trees while the last few rays of sunlight filter through the glass roof overhead. I've lost count of the number of times I've retreated to those benches or to the waterfront when the pressures of the workday occasionally became too much.For those in the area who need an hour or two to rest, recharge, and regroup - there is no better place than Brookfield Place. Although I'm saddened to leave this building right before the opening of Parm and L'Atelier by Joël Robuchon, I'm sure I'll return again at some point. Until then Brookfield Place... sayonara.",31,0.8402
591,12,14,4.0,"Actual rating: 4.5 StarsOh no. I have an issue. I am a California native. We will rep In N Out until death. Then I tried Shake Shack and my heart is SO confused. So I'm going to be very diplomatic about this. They are different burgers. There are so many minute different components between Shake Shack and In N Out that you cannot really compare them. What they have in common is that they are both delicious. Shake Shack is good. The fries are incredible (sorry In N Out, Shake Shack is the clear winner there. Cheese fries take over animal fries. Please don't hurt me.). The fries are the right amount of crispy. It we could mix Shake Shack fries with In N Out sauce, that would be perfection. The burger is solid. It's a good chuck of beef, delicious ripe tomatoes, earthy lettuce, and their sauce wrapped in a delicious egg bun. The bun is arguable one of the best things about the burger. Everything together -- so good. So. Damn. Good. Shake Shack is good. It is solid. I would recommend it to anyone who is a burger fan.",13,0.984
592,12,0,4.0,"Filipinos are passionate people.. and they are certainly passionate about their food (which in my opinion, makes it all the more delicious)! Although my bf is Filipino, this is the first time experiencing kamayan night which is only offered on certain days of the week. You will also need a reservation and there is a set price per person, so it is important to check the schedule and call ahead otherwise you will not be able to part take in the kamayan style meal. My experience at Jeepney was certainly very unique and enjoyable, especially with a large group of friends. What makes kamayan night unique is that you eat with your hands. This authentic type of Filipino cuisine means you won't be provided any utensils or plates and everything is laid out in front of you on large banana leafs. The food is plentiful and delicious. I especially loved the candied bananas and lumpias. There is also plenty of rice and longganisa (sausage). It does take a little getting used to, eating with your hands and it certainly adds to the dinner experience. The servers explain to you how to optimally eat with your hands, so don't worry, they will try to help you out! Overall, this was a pleasant and unique experience. There was so much food, that even our table of 11 had a few boxes of doggy bags to take home. The aromas, tastes and ambiance were really chill and fun. The service was attentive and kept our beers coming. If you are looking for something different and authentic, make sure to check out Kamayan night at Jeepney, it was delicious and fun!",14,0.9949
593,8,7,4.0,"The seedy building that houses Drunk Shakespeare threw me off, but man -- what an entertaining show it ended up being! I loved how seamlessly Shakespeare, alcohol, pop-culture references, and raunchy humor blended within the structure of Macbeth. The cast was witty, engaging, and totally able to keep the audience in stitches (and I mean, STITCHES) throughout the entire performance.I jotted down a lot of notes to incorporate into this review -- you know, having gone with complimentary tickets from Yelp and all -- but I also don't want to give anything away. Here's a list of five things that sound like total gibberish but would make sense to anyone who went to the same performance I did (December 10, 2014):   - Watermelon sexy talk   - Fresh........

594,11,7,4.0,"My 4 star review is an average of 2 separate visits to Vinny Vincenz.When my go-to pizzeria (Two Bros) closed down on 1st Ave, I immediately sought a replacement. My first trip to VV was last summer and I got my standard order: 2 slices and a soda. The pizza then was solidly average. Nothing spectacular, nothing really wrong with it either. At that time, the crowds in here were non-existent, i suspect due to the lack of air conditioning. I would have rated it a 3-star.Fast forward to last week.viewing.nyc/meet-the-guy…After the Instagram account @DollarPizzaSliceNYC rated this the highest thus far in the city, I came back for another trial order. This time, the pizza tasted completely different than before. Now the likelihood of them changing their recipe in the past 6 months is slim, so I attribute the change of quality to the increased patronage generated by the Instagram account, and closing of other nearby pizzerias. The more people there are, the quicker pies come out and the fresher the slice you get to shove into your mouth.The fresh dough was chewy but not spongy, thin but solid, great cheese density and sauce to cheese ratio. The sauce itself was a bit on the sweet side for me, but still a solid slice. I would have rated them 5 stars for a dollar pizza joint based on this slice.But... due to the inconsistency between the two visits, I thought it only fair to present them with an average, a 4-star rating. But in the end, does it really matter? You are going to eat a dollar slice based on convenience not on rating anyway... just know that if you have to duck in here for a slice or two, you will probably be alright.",16,0.9653

Not only were there ample fresh and flavorful entrees (your staple curries, tikka masalas, paneer), but there were also items that were freshly prepared and brought to your table. There were these appetizer potato patties with onions (awesome), flat pancake-like fried things (awesome), and naan (expected, but still awesome). They gave the two of us like 6 pieces of naan, which is a lot.Even the Kheer and sugar balls (not sure what real name is...) were delicious. Overall, loved the experience.

Every day, she said, she passed a specific billboard on her way to school with a bunch of women bending over, their behinds shapely and beautiful; it was an advertisement for a strip club in the area. She's well-versed, and I trust her taste, so when she said we were going to Sapphire to celebrate her Big 2-9, I trusted her judgement. Only the best for her! As it turns out, it was only the best for all of her guests, including myself, as well!A mutual friend got everything arranged for us, from the party bus to and from his apartment in Hell's Kitchen, a comped drink for each of us, to a nice reserved area between the main stage and the secondary platform. I mean...literally, there were girls dancing less than six feet away from me any any given point of the evening! Backing up a bit, the check-in process was simple and streamlined; the bouncers were friendly yet you could tell they take no bullshit. They checked our IDs, ushered us into the coat check, and led us into the main room. DAMN. Not sure what Shanna C.'s review was about. I'm not calling her a liar; everyone has a different experience. All I'm saying is that the vast majority of our group of thirteen was women (eight women and five men), and we were treated equally as any male customer with no bad reception. A friend in our group bought me a lapdance (...as he so eloquently stated, ""I'm not going to a strip club with Allison and NOT buying her a lapdance!""), and my dancer, Selina, was such a sweetheart and gorgeous to boot! I'm not prude, and this was not my first visit to a gentlemens' club, but it WAS my first lapdance. (Something to cross off of a bucket list, I suppose?) I was not expecting it, so I spent the first minute or so giggling like a little kid and I could feel myself blushing. Once I got over that, I actually enjoyed it! I told her that the beau (who wasn't able to make it out; poor him!) would have loved to see this. Ha! My friend, the birthday girl, had four (!!!) lapdances, and even got a Wicked Entertainment t-shirt from the night's guest, Jessica Drake. I swear, you've never seen a happier person in the whole entire world. The place is gorgeous, the music was bumpin', the girls were gorgeous, the staff was friendly yet firm with any troublemakers, and the dancers were never pushy about lap dances, et al.

598,16,7,4.0,"So, I've been going to Les Halles since 1999, the year after Anthony Bourdain started in 1998, and it's always been a go-to spot for me for very good casual French country cuisine. Unfortunately though, it seems that the average rating is lower now (3.5), mainly because of the Bourdain ""followers"" who have unusually high expectations for this place. I think they come here with the expectation to be blown away by a 5-star restaurant because this is Anthony Bourdain's first Executive Chef role, and where he remains as a ""Chef-at-Large"", but they have to remember that this is after all, a Brasserie (meaning casual with hearty food with beer/wine) serving simple, comfort dishes all-day, at a fair, maybe even low, price, in my opinion.The place is meant to be casual, with French country food from Gascony (the ""Breadbasket of France"") such as Duck Confit, Cassoulet, SaucIsse, Rabbit, Foie Gras, Roquefort cheese, Coq Au Vin, Steak Au Poivre, Pate, Escargot, etc. Along with an excellent list of wines from almost every region in France - Burgundy, Northern Rhone, Loire Valley, etc...Monday nights are the best as ALL bottles are 50% off!This is one of my favorite casual go-to restaurants, when I don't know what I want to eat, and where I don't want to spend a ton of money, but I do want some good wine & ambiance, and when I don't want to have to deal with a reservation (I've always been seated immediately or within 10 minutes). If this sounds like you, then this is your spot.

You access the bar either by the elevators on the left hand side of Grand Central Oyster, or from the Vanderbilt side of Grand Central. The bar itself is extremely dark and has two floors. An older claim to fame was its cameo in the Gossip Girl series. There are seats around the bar, or sofas and couches scattered throughout the room. I recommend making a reservation or else the wait can be a joy kill. That said, the ambience is great for groups. It isn't an intimate setting, so it's not ideal for dates since you will probably be spending half the time asking your date to repeat what he or she said. The upper level is a bit more intimate and quiet but it is darker and usually reserved for larger parties. My go to drink here is the Prohibition Punch. This is served in a large fish bowl glass and is composed of Moet, Grand Marnier and Rum. If you're in the mood for something a little harder, they have a great selection of bourbons.",18,0.9742

The rice was done well and seemed pretty fresh, which I like. The beans and chicken/meat seemed to taste a little dry and I think it could use stronger flavors, but definitely filling. The salsa was a little lacking in firepower, but it seems like a different mix than your usual tex-mex salsa.Overall, not bad.

Of course everyone knows the great things about it, the awesome roast pork buns from Hop Shing, the bbq items hanging from the windows, the soup dumplings, the cheap quality imitations, and cheap prices in general. But we have our share of corruption, rudeness, city rats, and skid row looking areas. Despite moving away several times in my life, I find myself missing C-town when I am too far. Not so much the rude people but more the hustle and bustle, the stores, and being around people like me....and I really miss Hop Shing's baked roast pork buns and Cha Chang Tang's Fish Fillet with Spaghetti and tomato sauce and Heping's soup dumplings! One thing changing is the Cantonese stores and restaurants that once populated the entire area are now dwindling down to near nothing. This saddens me. That is what I grew up with.

The location is upstairs on the fourth floor hidden behind a door of frosted glass. Upon entering, you are immediately checked in to your appointment and whisked away. The front desk and the room of beds are split by a partition. The technician I worked with is Naomi. She quickly consulted me before our appointment. She presented me with a frame of samples of individual lashes. The curl of the lashes range from J, G, and C. The length ranges from 0.8 mm to 0.15 mm. For the most natural look, she recommended a mixture of 0.9 mm and 0.10 mm. The room consists of a row of massage tables. Each table is covered with clean white bed sheets, complete with a fleece blanket and a neck pillow filled with micro-beads. Comfort is an important quality at any eyelash salon. A session can last from thirty minutes to an hour long depending on the extension type. Naomi diligently and gently applied the classic set onto my eyes. They have stayed on for two weeks thus far with very little fall-out. Some Pro Tips: If you need to cancel your appointment, cancel at least 6 hours before. Missing your appointment results in an automatic $50 charge on your credit card. If you are more than 10 minutes late, your appointment will automatically be rescheduled. Avoid wearing any liquid eyeliner or mascara the day of your appointment. To avoid paying full price, Groupon deals are available for $45 for a classic set.

We were so stuffed even before tow hours time slot. My choice of drink, a cold herbal tea (not sweet), helped to enjoy my meal even better, a slight bitterness rounded the complex flavors. I loved the spicy soup more than herbal. It became a great soup at the end with Udon noodle. That numbness sensation from Sichuan peppers are hard to find in most Sichuan restaurants in the city but this spicy soup packed with Sichuan peppers and left great numbness in the soup with all the flavors from what we put in and I couldn't get over how good that was.

It's absolutely worth it, and the butter was melt-in-your-mouth amazing! Good thing I learned that it was goat's milk butter later, because I normally don't eat it. As my first time having sweetbread (I believe ours was thymus), it wasn't as horrific as I imagined. The blackcurrant surprisingly masked the earthy/gamey taste very well. My friend and I did end up eating everyone else's sweetbread though haha.The chamomile ice cream with strawberry reduction sauce was lovely, and I was impressed by how well they teased out the fragrance of the chamomile ice cream. The (buckwheat?) yogurt with grains and seeds was my absolute favorite though!On the night that we came, the desserts stood out more than the main dishes. I'll be sure to give Contra another try, but I hope they improve their service (cold and hurried) and spacing between courses (we had empty dishes that weren't cleared for over 20 minutes and there were a few long gaps). Also, the portions are on the smaller side - if I hadn't gobbled up everyone else's sweetbreads, I probably would have left hungry. 3.5 stars.Notes:- space is hipster chic complete with brick walls and long wooden benches- food has clear Nordic influences- be sure to make a reservation!",17,0.989

So don't despair if you can't sit at a table immediately - there's plenty of couch space between tables as well.

To be honest, it's when I pass by Wallsé on my way home and see how pretty it is that enticed me to first suggest coming here when our overseas buddy came for a recent work trip. It is really the first and only place I have come to try Austrian/ German food in NYC and our group of friends were all pretty excited to try this top rated restaurant on our bucket list. Upon arriving, we noticed the art decor and coziness of the restaurant. It's very cozy, very cute and the ambiance truly deserves all the praise it gets. After we were escorted to our seats and I found the plush couches very comfortable and luxurious. For the food, we were pleasantly surprised to find that you didn't have to order a pre-fix dinner, so we opted to order randomly (not that pre-fixes are bad, that night we just weren't in the mood to eat a multi-course meal). We did share a few apps, one of which was the foie gras. My whole group really recommends this, especially if you are a foie gras person. For my entree, I opted for the lamb which was super tender and absolutely delish. The veggies that come with it are also superbly cooked. For the most part, everything was made wonderfully but I didn't have a favorite that really stuck out to me, other than what I ordered. My friends had some of mine and they agreed that they also enjoyed the lamb over their scallops and rabbit. Both of those other dishes were also tasty, but perhaps we don't quite have the pallet for rabbit so we couldn't fully appreciate the taste. Overall, it was a nice experience here. The service and quality are what you expect from a Michelin rated NYC restaurant. Venturing to Wallsé is definitely worth it, especially if you want to try Austrian German food.

The hot and sour soup- right portion, not too small or big. Also standard but perhaps a little thinner so less on corn starch. Two Peking duck which we ooh and aahed at. Wrapped in a tortilla (was surprised it wasn't the bao) with a little too much hoisin and scallion. Imwas cool with the wrapper. The duck themselves were good- maybe a bit dry on meat and much skin. They were not big ducks. (Vegetarians got bbq veggies inside)The rest of the entrees were: Beef and broccoli- eh takeout quality Orange flavored chicken - like general tso consistency and skin, I liked this orange flavor they used real oranges.Crispy sea bass with a sweet garlic sauce- even though the sauce was thick the crispy skin of the fish never faltered. And the white I sides remained yummy and soft. Shrimp mayo sauce - this could have been crispier it wasn't like the traditional style with candied walnuts which I think is money. Shrimp fried rice- delicious, not too brown or fried with ham, veggiesVeggie fried rice - didn't try, looked good. String beans with minced pork - delicious Sichuan classic but a bit early For dessert, they brought us a deep fried banana which went well with he banana cake that I brought on my own from Billy's bakery (plug: that cake is awesome- like a banana bread).

Much like Red Rooster and Ginny's Supper Club, Streetbird pays homage to old Harlem, but not in the 1920s speakeasy kind of way - this time we are bringing it back to 80s. It's unusual to see pairs of sneakers hanging from the ceiling of a restaurant, but if you know Harlem in the 80s and 90s, then you'll understand the concept. I absolutely love the funky decor.The restaurant has only been open three days prior to our visit, so they were not accepting reservations yet. We arrived at 7:30pm and walked into a full house. Chef Marcus, was standing at the entrance, which was very exciting! After I snapped a pic with him, I made my way to the bar to wait for our table. There wasn't a drink menu, but the bartenders were able to list the cocktails for me. I went with the Juicy Fruit, which I believe is made with mango puree, rum, and a splash of pickle - very tasty. We ordered Crispy Bird, Old Broadway Wings and New Jack Fried Rice. Everything was bomb, as I expected. The wings are super spicy, but so good, and the Crispy Bird is juicy and flavorful. I don't know what spices and rubs they're putting on their chicken, but trust me when I say the flavors are all there. Oh, and the fried rice was actually the best fried rice I've ever had - better than any Asian restaurant I've been to. Our meal was just under $30, and the Juicy Fruit was $9.I always step back and assess new businesses and properties in Harlem and ask myself if it diminishes or preserves the culture of the neighborhood. Well Streetbird definitely preserves the culture, and as a Harlem native, I appreciate how Chef Marcus is working the neighborhood's restaurant scene.

No more getting thru the velvet curtains. Luckily, for them, my reservation was not lost and was on the infamous ""list.""Hedge fund, narcissistic, pretentious, socialite, fashionista, Upper Eastside crowd. Imagine this. Walking past the bar area where a man, with Albert Einstein hair and looked orange from over tanning is talking a bit too loudly about how many billionaires he knows.My small dinner party entered with great anticipation and the only thing I can say is that there is no question in my mind or anyone blind that this is a polo themed bar. Everything and I mean everything was polo related but in the Ralph Lauren green and signature plaid and colors. From the deep, rich forest green on the walls, to the plaid pillows that sat in the corners. To the polo sticks, to the walls completely covered with pictures of polo players and horses. This was and is a polo themed restaurant/bar. When I say that the walls are covered I mean covered. Every inch covered with various sized framed pictures of horses and people who ride them. I would guess that there was at least a 1-2 finger width space left between each picture. But, the green that escaped from the wall was a beautiful color. Deep like a forest but full of richness. Outside of the extensive amount of pictures of horses there were plenty of mirrors. The mirrors were seated eye level and lined the walls around the dining embankments. Here's the best way to describe it. If you wanted to slyly check out the people at the other table all you had to do was look like you were looking at your dinner guest and you had an eye shot of the other tables on the other side and behind you. We were escorted downstairs to our table where the dining room opened up into a sea of people. We were directed to our table and as I sat down I was left with the impression that this is what country club dinners must be like. But not everyone had country club flare because at the table next to my party was a woman dressed in a skin tight Herve Leger dress and I think newly done boobs because she took the butter dish which was ablaze with a Polo Bar logo paper cover and balanced it on her boobs and took a selfie. I kid you not. She will be forever known as butter boobs.Now for the food and drinks. Nicely done. A sampling of the typical fare, steak, seafood, chicken, burger and sides. I skipped ordering an appetizer because I wanted dessert. For my entrée, I ordered the Veal Chop which was outstanding. I tried to get every last morsel off the bone and was tempted...yes tempted to pick up the bone with my right hand and get Fred Flinstone-like and polish off the last bits of veal with my teeth....But I did not. The cocktail list was nice. All I have to say is get the Moscow Mule. They did an amazing job with the drink. Not too gingery and just right amount of lemon and kick. Now for dessert. What girl doesn't love chocolate? Well, there are probably some that don't but I love chocolate. I ordered the seven layer Chocolate Cake and begrudgingly agreed to share it. I knew I was going to regret that decision as soon as they brought this big slice of heaven to the table. My mouth was watering even before I picked up my fork which must have been too slow because the next thing I know a chunk of the cake was gone. Calming myself I did not want to turn this evening out into Oz prison scene, I gathered my composure and took a small but healthy bite out of the slice and ohhhhhhh boy. It was delicious. Delicious doesn't even seem like the right word to use for how good this was.If you can get in, I would say go to the Polo Bar. Was it the best experience I ever had? No, there are other restaurants in the city where the experience is better but if you love the game of polo, want to touch polo sticks, are a fan of all things Ralph Lauren and love chocolate cake, I would say absolutely go.",19,0.9984

632,8,7,4.0,"As you can tell, I am a fan of ""hidden gems"". This restaurant is located behind a non nondescript butcher shop on Greater Jones Street. The door, while glass, is opaque, shielding the interior to outsiders. What I like most about this place is the privacy. The dining room could probably seat 20 people at most. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and polite. The menu offers an array of seasonal delights as well as permanent dishes. What stood out to me was the miso cod. Everyone in New York raves about Nobu's miso cod, but I personally feel that Bohemian serves a much better miso cod. Other note worthy dishes include the uni croquette. The croquette offered a delicate balance of tastes that allow you to enjoy the creaminess of both the sea urchin and the potato, without overpowering one another. I begrudgingly agreed to order the vegetable fondue but it was more decorative than delicious. The branzino was also well done but it is meant for FOUR. Since I went there with one other person, it was way too much food and we both ended up overeating.",11,0.985

634,9,25,4.0,"This place is pretty ducking great. Pardon me, I should apologize for my fowl language.Okay, now that those puns are out of my system, Ducks Eatery really is a great spot with great food. If an intriguing fusion between southern and Asian-inspired comfort food sounds alluring to you, it's certainly worth a visit. The space is small but scoring a table isn't too difficult. And the cinephile in me appreciates the projector towards the back silently showing classic films against a brick wall. It might seem a little gimmicky but it adds a very nice touch of atmosphere.Of course, the food is the real draw and Ducks Eatery absolutely delivers. The Whole Goat Neck for two is quite possibly the biggest draw. The meat is fall-off-the-bone tender and can easily be eaten with a fork. Goat neck probably isn't the most popular cut of meat in New York, but even if it were, this one would surely rank as one of the best.Also terrific is the Duck and Waffle, which is conveniently available on the dinner menu. The duck is moist and tender (I'm sensing a theme here), and the breading is well seasoned. The waffles are good but not exemplary, though they do the job of tying the dish together.I'd be amiss if I didn't bring up the drink selection too. The beer list isn't long but consists of a nice choice of craft brews. And with choices of great beers for $5 and under, there isn't a lot of scope for improvement. There's also a decent list of wine and cocktails if that's more your taste. But whatever you prefer, between the food, the drinks, and the solid prices, there surely is a reason to pay Ducks Eatery a visit.",20,0.9948
635,31,36,4.0,"I don't know how my peeps in the homeland aren't dead before 40. I mean, our food is delicious and all, but damn, we need to learn how to spell SALAD every now and then... does this make me, less Filipino? I digress...After three visits this is the 411:Skip it: Shrimp balls, pork buns, dumplings and Calamari Rings. Not terrible, just blah. Life's too short for a repeat of blah and it's a waste of calories. Get another drank, playa. Speaking of: the Weng-Weng. This was on the cocktail menu and even though it was strong it was way too sweet, which isn't my tang. Repeat offenders:The Sisig was on point. It had more liver then I like, but was dope and it deserves a return visit at a future date when I'm craving it. The Dasilog was tight. Cooked well and tasty. It's $2 more then what you would pay for at Cafe 81 and just as good. To me, this is one of those dishes that's like pizza, even when it sucks, it's still aight. And as much as I want to say, ""damn, I only pay $6/7 bones for this in JC or in Queens"" I won't, cuz that's not fair with the rent these peeps must be paying up in here. Ditto, the Longsilog dish. I'm pretty sure the longanisa was made in-house or sourced locally, because it didn't taste frozen like it can at some Flip joints that pose as a legit restaurant. The garlic fried rice that comes with isn't as ""garlicky"" as I would love, but it's still good.The Laing is one the best I've ever had...ever. The thing with Flip food(or any food for that matter) is that everyone cooks it a little different. Some joints will serve this mad runny/soupy and way too salty or worse, put msg in it. This was heaven for a brother. It's thick and rich, with that coconut flavor that brings me back to a place called, home. That said, the taro leaves were still the star, which it should be, 'cuz ""nobody puts baby in the corner"". the star:The shrimp adobo is an instant foodboner for this Pinoy boy. This was a nice twist on something traditional. I always eat pork or chicken adobo. Matter of fact, it's the only Filipino dish I know how to make that I don't use those packets for; I got my own take on it and it's DOPE! But, I digress...First off, its fried with the head on and if you ain't know me, I LOVE SKRIMP HEADS. If i've said it once, I've said it a zillion times... the flavor is in THE HEAD! GET IT!!! Don't just suck the juice from the head(*twss) - eat it whole, because the entire skrimp has been fried to perfection & ready for your pleasure with that sticky sweet sauce that's bursting with mad flavor in your ear. It's muy Del'eh'see'oh'so and is the Sofía Vergara of Flip dishes; it makes you do a double take, cuz something this old school shouldn't look this new and it's even better then you thought it was going to be...on yo TONGUE! But, I digress... The staff: Friendly and efficient. They do a good job, even when it gets busy and it gets busy on fridays. The space:It's longer then it looks (I wish she said that. Wait,what?) Tables in the back are too close for my liking when it gets packed. I'm a fan of the two tops at the bar area for max chill. But, if you bring the fam bam, I guess one has to put up with the shit show that is the dining area. The rest of my B. S. : They got Kamayan nights, like Jeepney. Haven't done yet, but then again all it is really is eating the same stuff, but with your hands. Yeah, I do that at home anyway. It gets hoppin around 8ish, cuz the DJ starts setting up for his 9 o'clock set. You know you're Filipino when you got a family memeber who's a DJ and you can't wait for some hip hop and R&B sounds to eat with your Sisig. Double down dawg, it's here. Tuesday's happy hour is all night. Yes, you read right... All... Night... Long...just the way she likes it. When downtown and dining alone, I go to Cafe 81. It's cheaper by a few bucks and quiet, which is my steez when (Han) solo. When with friend(s) and feeling something more traditional in food, but with a dope beat to step to, this is the spot. The menu isn't as extensive as Cafe 81 (or is as traditional:see shrimp adobo) and isn't as new and hip as Jeepney; It's in the middle & leans a tip (just the tip) toward traditional then updated. Mainly a 50% young, cool, downtown Filipino crowd the 3x I dined in and that should tell you something. Old school hip hop blares overhead even before the DJ's set starts and the vibe is chill, just like my (Nia) peoples. It doesn't feel like lola's house, but more like your older cousin's crib on a friday night, sans strippers and the weed. And who wouldn't want to be a part of THAT! Duh!",41,0.9991
636,23,16,4.0,"I am writing this review based on the service & the taiyaki. I tried the takoyaki for the 1st time here but I have never had it before so I will write a review update once I try takoyaki at a different location. Taiyaki (Medetai?): There are 2 kinds, one with red bean & one with banana + nutella. I ordered a taiyaki with just plain nutella in it. I waited for a really long time for my taiyaki and the woman behind the counter saw this and gave me another red bean taiyaki for free which was extremely kind of her. The taiyaki is typical but I have had better taiyaki before with more filling and for less. But then again, I got one for free so I cannot complain. Takoyaki:as i said before I had never had this before. They look pretty cool and I am a big fan of octopus. They put fishy benito flakes on top and some kind of mayo sauce. I think next time I will order the takoyaki without the flakes or mayo because I am a typical American who likes starchy chewy things and I need to develop a taste for Japanese food.  But be careful to completely cool your takoyaki because it is super HOTThey have combo deals as well. Cons: no seating inside, cash only, there is only a bench outside to sit with a friend when the weather is warmPros: friendly staff, cute interior, can watch how the food is made Their seasonal desserts are cute. I think they are running a promo on matcha taiyaki",24,0.9959

We had a couple of people on our team who were not team players and basically were so full of themselves and forgot there were other players in the room. They would not communicate even when asked direct questions. That is not fun to play with people like that so with that said, pick your team wisely. I do not recommend leaving it to chance who your teammates are because if you end up with someone who is arrogant and is not a team player...it's not cool. Most important thing about this game is teamwork and communication. If you find a clue, share it with your team. Do not keep the clue to yourself, involve your team. There is no ""I"" in team. I can not stress that enough. The live version of the escape game is just like the online escape adventure games or the ones in apps. You will be physically locked in a room with other players and a zombie. You will have to use elements of the room to solve a series of puzzles, find clues, and escape the room within a set time limit, which in our case it was one hour. The players explore their surroundings in order to find these puzzles, clues, keys, locks, etc. You have to be observant and use critical thinking skills get out of the room....hopefully within the time limit or it will be game over for you. The zombie will try their best to tag you out. The zombie is on a chain where the chain will be a foot longer every 5 minutes. You have to quickly move around this zombie in order not to get tagged. If you get tagged, you will have to stand in the corner of the room for the rest of the game and only contribute verbally. Bring friends who are good at team work and communication. No one wants someone who holds clues for themselves and not share the game with others. Tell everyone when you find a clue!!!!!!! Let the room figure it out. NOT A TIME TO BE SELFISH!!!!! If you get a room full of people you know....it's more fun. But you can join others' games too. Bring a notebook to keep track of the clues and SHARE THE CLUES! Let everyone in the room take a look at all clues. Give others a crack at the clues! I can't stress this enough. It's a GROUP EFFORT. It's a team exercise. There is no ""I"" in team!Keep track of the time. In our game we had a gamekeeper who kinda nudged at us when she felt like we needed help. Make sure you get to the game early and on time. They do lock the door behind you. Wear comfy clothes. It's not a place to wear heels and short skirts, you might have to look under things and crawl a bit.

639,20,17,4.0,"1). All things come to those who wait.2). All is well that ends well. I think those are two proverbial phrases that nicely sum up my first* visit to Cosme. Let me explain!1). All things come to those who wait. And wait we did. This restaurant has been super popular, so I understood that getting a reservation would be near impossible, but when we somehow (luckily! astonishingly!) did get a last-minute reservation we hoped that we'd at least get seated soon after our arrival. But we waited for 45 minutes before we were seated!! The hostess was apologetic, but still!The 45 minutes did give us plenty of time to observe the dining room and really peruse the food and drinks menu. While the bar area was crowded and loud with anxious walk-in diners, the dining room area was spacious, dark, sexy and cool. And despite the dim lights elsewhere, lights shone down from above onto each table so diners knew exactly what their food looked like. The drinks menu was dizzyingly impressive; there were lots of creatively-named cocktails (""Jack be Nimble, Jack be Quick""!), Mexico City staples, wines (so many from Spain, Chile, France, and even one from Lebanon!), tequilas, and mezcales. The waiting didn't really stop. We were brought to our table and still had to wait a few minutes for our server to take our orders. Then more for the drinks to come. Then quite a bit until complimentary blue corn tostadas (so delicious!) with a pumpkin seed and habanero butter (packed some heat!) came.2). All is well that ends well. Then...a dish came. We looked at it and took small bites that quickly turned into enthusiastic bites, and it was almost like our earlier disappointment had never even happened. After one big sigh of relief, an overwhelming sense of excitement for what was to come washed over us. I do have to say that the first dish that came out was something we didn't order, but they let us eat it anyway. Win.a. Uni tostada: The crunchy, earthy goodness of that tostada was the perfect vehicle for the avocado, uni, bone marrow salsa, and a splash of lime. I was surprised with the generous amount of smooth, silky uni that was on top. J's shellfish allergy prevented him from enjoying this, but it was actually only an amount for one person anyway.b. Chicarron: The chicarron was huge, crispy, and well-seasoned. The tomato-y hot sauce was the real winner of this dish, though. We jokingly considered ways to sneak the bottle out. c. Burrata: I was surprised that he wanted to order this, but I was glad we did! The burrata was thick on the outside with a really creamy center and that center mixed wonderfully with the salsa verde to create a heavenly dip of sorts. There was only one lone tostada to scoop everything with, though, which was a shame. d. Broiled red snapper: This was the dish that came by mistake, but we were so lucky! The snapper was cooked absolutely perfectly (so lean and moist), and the Thai hoja santa salsa added such a unique burst of flavor to elevate the dish.e. Duck carnitas: Wow. The carnitas were braised in orange and Mexican Coca-Cola and served to us on a big skillet. The duck was sweet in a non-cloying way, and was the softest ""melting in your mouth we don't even need knives"" duck I've ever had. Building our own warm tortilla tacos with the duck and salsa verde was just...sigh, we felt so spoiled. We chatted briefly with two diners from Mexico seated next to our table who were writing an article about Cosme for a magazine. They were impressed, as were we, and they were happy that the chef was introducing the versatility and energy of Mexican cuisine to New Yorkers. They were also quick to inform us that this was just a small sliver of the different styles of food Mexico has. Until more restaurants open, I'll gladly eat these exciting dishes - dishes that are far from the fast food we've come to associate with the country. Likelihood of another visit:*A second visit is almost guaranteed as the food was so delicious. I can't wait to come with friends. My golly gee, I'm still dreaming of the duck carnitas. The prices were very steep, but none of the dishes disappointed me in the slightest, so the wallet will just have to fatten up before a second visit.

It's similar to a Dig Inn, but what I loved about the place is that it's completely gluten free (so I had a lot more options). It's packed during lunch hour as you would expect. But the service is quick and you can always order ahead and just do a pick up. They have soups, bowls (which you can do with one of the four proteins options & different sides - they have both hot & cold sides), salads, sandwiches, cold-pressed juice and GF baked goods. I got the bowl with two sides - with tofu, cold soba noodle salad and charred broccoli. Here's what I liked about the bowl - it was flavorful, filling and healthy. Exactly what you want in a work day lunch. The tofu was grilled and was soft and juicy. The charred broccoli were amazing - cooked and seasoned to perfection and the cold soba noodle salad was exactly how you would expect it - slight and refreshing. My boyfriend got the salmon with side of the beet quinoa. The salmon was fresh and cooked well and the quinoa was a nice side to make the dish wholesome.I would highly recommend coming out here for lunch or dinner. You can try to avoid the long lunch lines by coming a little early, but the service is pretty quick that you can get in and out in 15 minutes max even during peak times.

I have been here only once, so I shall resist the temptation to be overly judgemental.The reservation experience for Atera is a bit frightful. Given the fixed number of seats, they are particular about reminding you of the penalty for late cancellation (price of the dinner). And they appear inflexible about accommodating dietary restrictions, which turns out to not be the case during your visit. They are however quite particular about you arriving on time since late arrivals can put the rest of the diners out of sync with you.You will likely be seated on one of the dozen high chairs if you are not occupying the lone table on the side. And you will get to watch the cooks at work. It has the feel of having front-row seats in a laboratory, which is only fitting since I suspect equal parts of art, chemistry and culinary creativity go into designing the twenty-course menu at Atera. Molecular gastronomy and all that.Several months have passed, and I now only remember the yogurt nuts with beets, the sweet potato dish, the banana ice cream, and the butter cake. But I can say that no two dishes were identical or even similar in taste or presentation. And the service was uniformly attentive throughout the meal.Come to Atera to splurge on a culinary adventure that lasts almost three hours, and would leave you short by at least three hundred dollars a person for dinner and drinks.

Pocketed in a building adjacent to the Bobby Van's restaurant is the very small Bobby Van's Burger joint serving a good number of dishes perfect for breakfast or lunch. They also provide a nice outdoor seating area, away from the street. I never see this area too full. There is always a table and seat to grab. This might be one of my favorite lunch spots at the moment. Because it's inconspicuous, there are never lines. The pricing is also relatively cheap for what you can get, especially compared to mediocre but overpriced delis around here.At some point, I'll have to try their burgers. Believe it or not, burgers are not the only thing being served. I can speak for the semi-healthier options. For one, their salads are absolutely worth it. You get a pretty good portion, and they offer the dressing and cheese on the side, and plenty of it. The Mixed Green Salad ($5) is always a great choice. The french fries and sweet potato fries are also tasty, but I personally prefer the sweet potato fries. The soups are just okay. Had their Seafood Chowder, and it actually tasted a bit bland. The Beef Barley soup is definitely a better choice.I want to check out the breakfast menu here as I am betting it is much better than say Starbucks or Europa.

643,31,24,4.0,"Very nice addition to the Murray Hill area close to where I work. It's the sister speakeasy cocktail joint to downtown Little Branch. Lacking the bro-fisting that is normally seen in bars around these parts it's a classier choice to score a liquid refreshment. Heck, Home On The Range is a terrific cocktail, and at $12 a bit cheaper here than most speakeasies in NYC!Been here a few times now for an after work cocktail. As it's kind of hidden in what looks to be just another residential brownstone you can easily walk by, but it's not all that hard to find. There is a plaque on the face of the building with the letters MB along with a wrought iron fence that surrounds it. As it's a two story place the open windows with patrons seen drinking during warmer weather kind of gives it away.Head downstairs to the lower level, walk through the curtain, and enter a dimly candle lit bar area with plenty of communal high tables to rest your elbows on and enjoy a cocktail. Mainly standing room here. The upstairs features a brighter lit room with tables and chairs along with waitress service. A bit more upscale looking. The doorman/host will direct you where to go if you have parties larger than two, or if on a date and want a more intimate deal upstairs. The libation menu is pretty simple and reminds one of the Little Branch offerings. Many cool and fun drink names with descriptions, but I usually go with the Bartender's Choice when I am feeling more adventurous as per usual in a speakeasy spot. Make me something with bourbon or whiskey and I'm a happy camper. Can't go wrong with the great mixologists at these places. I did get a Home On The Range which I really enjoyed, along with a sazerac, and a few other boozy concoctions that escapes my memory. Yes, my liver still hates me.It's a laid back spot that is just so perfect for an after dinner drink to relax and unwind. I am a sucker for a quality cocktail bar with a speakeasy ambiance.

Always being in the mood for Mediterranean food, it sounded like it would hit the spot and it definitely did.We stopped in on a Saturday evening and had about a half-hour wait, which was fine and easily whiled away at the second floor bar with a glass of sauvignon blanc. The restaurant itself spans two levels with the downstairs area being a bit louder and more chaotic. We were seated upstairs which is quieter and narrower, so feels more intimate (worth considering if you're on a date!). The menu at Beyoglu is pure Turkish classics and everything is excellent. I will say the menu is not terribly extensive, but everything on offer was great. My friend and I started with a meze platter which was a nice mixture including hummus, some excellent eggplant spread, etc. We also shared a shepherd salad which was light and well-dressed and a doner kebab platter (mixed lamb and beef over rice). These items were more than enough for two people, and more would've been too much. (So keep in mind the portions here are huge!)Overall, Beyoglu is an excellent choice and a surprisingly affordable one at that for the Upper East Side.

The most important thing to consider before going out of your way to get a reservation at Tanoshi is...do you like fish, or LOVE fish? For someone who binges on mediocre quality sushi all to frequently, I didn't expect my dinner at Tanoshi to leave me so hungry. This is in fact, because I'm not consuming Japanese food correctly. The experience at this restaurant is perfectly timed and portioned. So, if you are a ga-vone* such as myself, come for the stellar night of learning, and for some of the most fantastic, mouth watering morsels of fish you've ever consumed (not to leave feeling like you're gonna vom). The atmosphere is also far from trendy. At Tanoshi it's about authenticity, minimal Japanese decor, and feeling welcomed into Chef Toshio's home. If you are looking to wow a date dressed in heels and a short black number, perhaps somewhere like Morimoto is more for you. Our omakase, a Thursday night 7:30PM set was as follows:-- Fluke Treated with Kelp-- Seared King Salmon-- Big Eye Tuna -- Firefly Squid -- Wild Albacore Tuna with Shaved Egg Yolk-- Miso Cured Black Sable -- Poached Scallop-- Marinated Salmon Roe-- Santa Barbara Sea Urchin with Quail Egg-- Salt Water Eel -- Shot of Miso Soup -- Great or Everything Roll -- Tuna Hand Roll-- Salmon Belly (ordered a la carte)Of all of the sampling I found myself most enamored with the miso cured black sable, salmon belly, poached scallop, and fluke with kelp. The poached scallop and black sable were so soft and fresh my mind nearly exploded the very moment I tasted it. I was also pleasantly surprised by the firefly squid and the salt water eel, as these typically aren't my favorites on the grounds of texture but prepared so delicately they were a fantastic bite! As for my first time trying sea urchin...yikes! The diner next to me kept claiming it as 'the butter of the sea,' based on it's creamy consistency but it's far too earthy for my taste. If you're looking to add additional pieces to your meal make sure to ask the sushi chefs as they give great recommendations along with the origins and flavor profiles of the fish. Now that I've rambled on incoherently about sushi for the past 1K+ words I'll leave it to you to decide if this artfully presented sushi exhibition is for you...*Leave it to me to use Italian slang on a review of one of my new favorite Japanese restaurants.",12,0.9931
646,8,18,4.0,"Emmett's is hot hot hot right now. I came at 6:30pm on a Wednesday, put my name and cell phone # in with a 90 minute wait, which ended up being an hour wait. We got a call about 30 minutes in asking if we'd like to place our pizza order, which is unusual, but logical, as it takes 45 minutes for the pizzas to cook. The staff was well-meaning, but flustered, and I could see the helplessness on their faces. This place is small! And when opening, I am certain that the owner did not anticipate this type of buzz or interest in Chicago pizza. New Yorkers are all about the thin crust, right? So I don't want to criticize the staff. However, I can criticize the aggressively obnoxious party of 4 that steamrolled the hostess with ""oh, we have 6 people now. Yeah, we'll just squeeze in"", then proceeded to unapologetically sit on my purse, and pretend that it was ok to put 6 people in an already tight 4-person table. The girl was literally 1"" away from me. If I wanted to eat dinner with a bitch in my lap, I would have brought the dog with me.So the shitshow and popularity of this place aside, this is actually some really great pizza. My only foray into the world of Chicago pizza was going to the old Pizzeria Uno on the Upper West Side when I was little, and I remember being pretty disappointed. Emmett's is what I would expect from the best of the Chicago knife and fork pies. Thick buttery crust, formidable, but not stale or too tough. Thick robust tomato sauce. Good quality pepperoni (I am sure they use the same supplier as my favorite pizza place of the moment - Fiore's). And gobs of stringy mozzarella that make life worth living. My husband and I split a 10"" medium pizza and a salad, and that was the perfect amount of food for us. To be fair though, I was pretty hungry going in.The beer and wine list was reasonably priced ($7 Gruner woo hoo!), but I can't see coming back.

648,25,21,4.0,"Spontaneous adventures in NYC are simply the best. Our dinner tonight at Hunt & Fish Club was certainly one of those. My partner in crime and I came here on a whim to check out the official opening of this new restaurant. Part of us didn't want to go too far because of the freezing cold and the other part had been encouraged by a notice from Urban Daddy. We walked in just to grab a drink at the bar but upon noticing already how lovely the interior was, we decided to inquire for a table. We figured why not give this place a chance! From beginning to end we received nothing but attentive service from everyone who worked there. Even the owner (whose name I believe was Lester!) greeted us and told us because we were his very first diners on their first official day, our dessert would be free. Way to make me fall in love with you already... I took a break from alcohol this evening but I could not help but take a gander at their cocktail list. They had a great array of libations to suit every palate. Around the beautiful dining room with its lit up ceiling and marbled floors the waiters were bustling around attending to every guest as if they had no other. Without even a word a gentleman walked over to our table and saw it was a tad wobbly and fixed it before we could even make a comment. Never before have I seen such efficiency on an opening night. Not once did I get an air of pretentiousness or attitude which one might expect from a restaurant with such a name and such interior design. It was absolutely wonderful.Now that I've gushed about the service, let me get to food. I always believe restaurants can strive to better themselves after their openings and I see the potential in H&F's dishes. To start, my PIC and I shared the Baked Littleneck Clams, the Uni, Crab & Ponzu appetizer and the Oxtail & Bone Marrow French Onion Soup. I consider myself to be a baked clam connoisseur and these were delicious! There was an unknown undertone of flavor to the dish that I absolutely loved. I did not love the Uni appetizer (porrrrrr queeeeeee!!!) as it seemed a little too jumbled together in terms of taste and presentation. I can see this working if it was restructured and maybe another element added in. The soup was absolutely out of this world. On nights like tonight where you just want to stick your entire body in an oven to escape the cold, this soup was the perfect remedy. The broth was thick and hearty with chunks of oxtail meat and you could taste the sweet richness of the bone marrow in every drop. This soup is to die for. I would come back just for this dish alone. Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommended.For our mains, she ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon (Bubble & Squeak, Horseradish Créme Fraîche) and I was craving pasta (typical) so I went with the Cavatelli Wild Boar Ragù with Local Smoked Ricotta. After that toe-curling-inducing soup the pasta was a tad underwhelming... but as mentioned earlier I can see the potential in the dish. It needs something to give it more depth in flavor and I think it also needed some more cavatelli. Once I had eaten all of the pasta I still had ample chunks of boar left in my dish (which I of course took home and will find something useful to do with it later). I stole a bite of the salmon which was cooked perfectly medium rare with a dab of the horseradish créme fraîche. So yummy.For dessert it was hard for me to choose. At one point I had chosen the Chocolate Torte at the waiter's recommendation but then I saw the Sundae station out of the corner of my eye... my inner child squealed. They wheeled over two carts- one has a bunch of toppings and the other with my ice cream bowl ready to be doused in goodies! I wish I had asked for a scoop of chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla since I thought my sundae came with both choc and vanilla but it's all good. For toppings you can choose from: fresh berries, chocolate pearls, rice krispies, chocolate walnuts and hot fudge. GET ALL THE TOPPINGS!Oh and to make this meal even more interesting, we were interviewed by a reporter for the NY Post on what we thought about the restaurant and had our photo taken. That's a first for me... but I quite enjoyed it. We were also given a tour of the private rooms and were sold on using this venue in the future. It's such a beautiful restaurant and their attention to detail plus dedication makes us completely confident that they will wow anyone we send there.We also had some fun people sightings such as Charlie Gasparino and Darryl Strawberry. Definitely looking forward to more adventures in the New Year!",34,0.9992

650,12,10,4.0,"I have come to really enjoy this place while living in Hell's Kitchen. Being an ave away from my apartment makes it really easy to frequent and I am happy to have stumbled in and squeezed myself into the cramped bar space back in July because I have been a regular here ever since. Whether taking advantage of the dollar oysters (these run out often so try to arrive early before they do), splitting a bottle of wine with friends, or indulging in tapas, Briciola is a great venue to start your night at. No reservations though, sorry. Do not come with a large group. I say 3-4 people should be your max. Be advised that if you are in a group of more than two people you will likely be at a community table so you might need to hold back on talk of your Saturday night underground sex ring excursions (unless of course you think your neighbor may be into some weird shit too). Just kidding guys, not in an underground sex ring, so cool your excitement. Anyway, my go to here is the sangiovese by the glass. I have gotten a few bottles here too but blanking on the types at the moment. The french bartender here seems to know his shit so go to him for a solid Q&A on the wines. You will see the wine list is actually on a tiny wooden slab written in chalk and can be difficult to read at times so again refer to the french dude.Excellent food options here (I just get tapas) include:1. Tuna Tartare2. Lamb Chops3. Grilled Octopus4. BurrataAnd to no surprise, you can't go wrong with a fine selection of cheeses either. Yum Yum.",12,0.7877

And I want to say a hearty ""thank you"" to the staff! Most places don't let you use the restroom if you're not already a customer, and they definitely don't let you go into the back to use the employee one just because you're doing the pee-pee dance. Enough about my tiny bladder....It's a Soul Food Buffet. A big, comprehensive, delicious Soul Food Buffet. I got as much as I could fit into my styrofoam container. The Jerk Chicken was on point. Great, authentic seasoning. The BBQ Chicken was good as well but it resembled General Tso so much I was expecting it to be spicy. Damn.... now I want General Tso chicken legs. Someone get on that! The macaroni and cheese was adequate. It was like homemade... just not like my home. The collards weren't sweet! I have to qualify it like this because I've been subjected to some gawdawful collards recently. They were full of stems, but that seems to be standard with most places. At least these were thoroughly cooked and soft. They were just fine, really. Now the green beans were great! I should have gotten more. They were cooked with smoked turkey and that was the key to FlavorTown. Ugh... did I just use a Guy Fieri-ism??? Okay, kill me now. They charge by the pound, so all this food totaled up to just over 18 bucks. The counter guys are super friendly. All the guys are super friendly. This is a friendly establishment. There's lots of seating. I would have stayed if I wasn't on my limited break from work. Oh! I almost forgot. The Sweet Yams... pure South. Very sweet and buttery. Maybe too sweet for some, but I'm talking about Southern-sweet where the lemonade tastes like simple syrup. Don't get the big pieces, scoop up the butter drenched dregs.",16,0.9941
652,14,10,4.0,"I came here last Friday on a double date and came away very full and very happy. As you might know, Lupa is one of Mario Batali's more casual restaurants (I would say the vibe is similar to that of Casa Mono's, but the space is much bigger). The menu is quite large, so I'm glad we came as a group as we got to sample a number of dishes. We came in a bit too overzealous and had originally wanted to order a primi and secondi each, but the waiter quickly suggested ordering just three of each in addition to a few appetizers since otherwise we would have too much food. This was comforting; he wasn't trying to upsell us. What we ordered:Appetizers: I am a HUGE fan of cured meats, so we got the Affetati Grande (basically a large meat platter) to share. It came with a selection of 5-6 meats, and I thought the Linga (pickled veal tongue), and Testa (head cheese) were especially delicious. The platter also comes in a smaller size so if you're with just one other person, I would definitely suggest getting it to sample the various meats. We also shared the Spinach & Warm Pancetta Salad, which came exactly as the name would suggest. This was a light dish and brought some greens to our otherwise meat-heavy meal.Primi: We chose to get the Bucatini All'Amatriciana, the Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage & Fennel, and the Black & White Tagliatelle with Mussels & Jalapeno. My favorite by far was the Bucatini, with the Gnocchi coming in at a close second. The Bucatini was cooked perfectly al dente, and I very much liked the red sauce that came with it. The Tagliatelle was probably the most disappointing, the pasta itself was fine but the dish seemed slightly bland even with the jalapeno scattered throughout.Secondi: At this point we were actually starting to get full, but powered through our Secondi choices which consisted of the Heritage Pork Shoulder, Pollo (Chicken), and Octopus with Salsa Verde & Leeks. The meat on the pork shoulder was super tender and broke apart easily, but my favorite secondi had to have been the octopus - it came in a generous portion, the texture was perfect, and it was incredibly flavorful. I try not to order chicken at most restaurants but Lupa delivered a solid dish here; the skin was crispy but I found the meat to be slightly too dry for my liking. We were too full to try desserts, but I look forward to coming back and trying several next time!",19,0.9973
653,9,5,4.0,"KenScale: 8.0/10Hanjan is a modern Korean restaurant serving chef Hooni Kim's interpretation of Korean pub-style food paying homage to . Given my Korean background, I always have a bit higher standard for my mother country's cuisine. When I visited Hanjan during its early days, I liked the fresh ingredients but felt the seasoning was a bit too salty, probably catering to American audience that had been mobbing the restaurant since its opening. On my recent visit, however, my impression of the restaurant changed completely. Not only was the dining room subdued, but the flavor of the food also evolved to have more faithfulness to authentic Korean cuisine, which was a great pleasant surprise. I really loved a lot of dishes coming out from this kitchen, from the crispy perilla leaf dumplings with shrimp and pork, to short rib and pork belly skewers that were definitely above average with delicious and tender meat, to the beautifully cooked grilled half mackerel. I was somewhat underwhelmed by garlic fried chicken with pickles (with so many good fried chicken places opening these days, I think that was somewhat ineivtable), and spicy squid stir fry with organic somyun noodles was a bit too spicy to show the texture of the squid. On the other hand, I see the signature pork fat ""ddukbokki"" that I liked during my prior visits was even better than I had tasted before, with absolutely crisp rice cake that gave me delightful sensation. I expected a salty broth from the matsutake mushroom and brisket soup, but the broth turned out to be more or less perfect, with rich flavor without a ton of seasoning that would make it a great dish for cold winter nights. Kimchi and beef brisket fried rice with egg was another winner, a modern take on ""bokkeum bap"" (fried rice) with great balance of flavor and texture. Unfortunately, I came to dinner a bit too early and couldn't get a taste of the famed Korean spicy ramyun (whose broth is prepared for 12 hours and therefore the dish is available only after 9 p.m. every day). On my last visit, the broth was just overly sweet, but I would definitely love to see if this dish has evolved in the positive direction.On all my prior visits, the restaurant was absolutely packed and the didn't take reservations, so sometimes it would take up to 2 hours to wait for a table. This time, however, my dining companion was able to book a table at 6 p.m. the day before without much problem, and the chaotic dining area was definitely more subdued. The restaurant has a full bar, but I would stick with beer or traditional Korean/Japanese drinks like soju or sake. I've always liked the clean, modern vibe of this restaurant that wasn't too pretentious or divey. I'm glad to report that Hanjan is going on a right direction in showcasing how the Korean cuisine has and will evolve in the modern age. With a ton of terrible Korean restaurants in K-Town, I will gladly visit Hanjan instead whenever I have a huge craving for Korean food.",12,0.9991

Seriously, Thai food can be affordable in Midtown West!They consistently serve the most affordable and tastiest pad see ew not just in Hell's Kitchen, but in the entire city. The sweet soy sauce they use to make the dish beautifully caramelizes in the pan and gives the flat rice noodles another dimension to the otherwise commonplace dish. I also recommend their ox tail soup, which is a clear, aromatic broth that's absolutely lovely on cold winter days, even better than a bowl of pho.Appetizers worth ordering include: hae kern (the ground crab meat tastes more like fishcake but this satisfies the fried craving), steamed Thai dumpling (the shitake is quite yummy), and papaya salad (huge portion!) Other safe bets that won't blow your mind, but will not let you down: pad kee mao, green curry, tom yum soup, yum seafood (seafood salad). I should also mention that the service is extremely kind and friendly for NYC standards.However, this place is not a solid 5 stars because when you hit the misses, they're really misses. The pad thai was bland and unflavorful, which is surprising considering how tasty the pad see ew is.

To only receive half of a silver wear setting at a hip chef's LES Mexican joint has to indicate confidence rather than negligence, right? ...There I go again starting a story in the middle. Let's rewind. It's a chill Friday night and my boyfriend and I find ourselves on Stanton Street, early. We're searching for that laid back little cash-only noodle bar across the street from Arlene's Grocery. You know, the one called Noodle Bar. It's gone. In its place stands Mission Cantina, looking like a mix between a diner and a night club with its metallic surfaces, triangle mirrors and neon lights. They take our phone number, we go get drinks elsewhere, they call us to come back. I LOVE when restaurants do this.Once seated, I immediately order a michelada (perfection), and realize that the entire ceiling is hand-painted in a camouflage pattern. I ponder the amount of time and work that must have taken, while I simultaneously realize that the music sounds like my iPod from 2007.* Missy Elliot, Aaliyah, Nelly Furtado, the works. What IS this place? The entire ambiance puts me in the zone, and when the waiter returns I put on my big girl pants and order for my boyfriend and I: -- octopus ceviche with avocado, coconut milk and habanero-- grilled brisket alambres with bacon, queso Oaxaca, peppers and onions-- masa fried chicken with smoked habanero honey, pumpkin seed furikakeDone. I'm satisfied with my order and my boyfriend is jaw-dropped in shock that I made all the decisions for once. Every bite of food we consume is pure euphoria. The brisket dish is my favorite - fatty, but not TOO fatty, it melts in your mouth and the flavors have that distinct balance that reminds you that you're consuming a Bowien creation. Ride or Die B*tch plays as we polish off the honey habanero fried chicken.Before leaving I hit the restroom, and while waiting in line I'm questioned by another patron on which items I ordered.

It's really a nice place to relax and enjoy the scene, with plenty of room and not really that crowded... I came here with a group of 12 for my bestie's birthday. It was one of the few places that could accommodate large parties last minute. Brunch is really not bad at all- complimentary mimosa, or bloody mary as one would expect in this nabe :). I didn't get a coffee but plenty of people did and it seemed ok. I didn't think they did freshly squeezed OJ so I went for a bloody mary which was strong and tall- enjoyed the sizzly tomato juice flavor. Service was fine- a little slow but always available considering the place was so small we could flag her down easily. (Brunch went on for a while and they were kind enough not to kick us out. The crowd is beautiful and sceney with a bit of families/old money types mixed in. Pretty sure our waitress was a model she was tall and skinny. My one complaint was that they tried to seat 12 of us in two little small lounge booths (with small round tables) which could barely fit 6 let alone 13.. fortunately we moved once the entire party arrived to vacant tables on the side which we just pushed together. Now, onto the food: I had the kobe beef burger ($18) which seemed like one of the best items to get- not overly big, juicy, cooked perfectly medium rare, with good white cheddar and avocado. I wasn't a fan of the soggy bun (well the burger was just greasy) and I felt the onions were a bit flyaway but overall I think it was the best choice. Bf got the same. Mostly everywhere else got some kind of omelette or some variety of eggs benedict (they had the usual- with salmon, with veggies, regular, etc). My birthday girl got a fluffy goat cheese and asparagus omelet. Only one person got French Toast which honestly looked a bit sad. Everything savory came with really good crispy fries and there were not that many. When it came time to pay, we were surprised that tip was not included. They also specified they could only take a max of 5 credit cards which is annoying. for people - fyi. Glad we had cash. Came to $31 pp total.

She had been to one on a recent visit to South Korea, and the idea of cuddling with a kitten and a cuppa appealed to me greatly! I heard whispers of Meow Parlour for months, and you can bet the two of us were online at work the moment reservations opened up, technical difficulties be damned! We finally snagged a reservation for four on the evening of January 2nd, and it couldn't come soon enough. We arrived a few minutes past our 6 p.m. reservation time (damn you, slow F train!), but the staff at the front desk were friendly and understanding. We already paid $4 each for the initial half hour, but were given an official check in time and charged $4 for each additional half hour spent. (Easy enough.) Upon filling out waivers (smart and necessary), we all took off our shoes, Purelled our hands, and made our way towards Kitty Heaven! Admittedly, what took place was a trifle different than what I had in my head; I imagined myself being surrounded by a veritable whirlwind of kitten love. Instead, it was much more peaceful. In fact, many of the kitties said, ""Screw you guys. I'm sleeping in this cubby hole!"" And you know what? That's okay! There were quite a few that were willing to pal around with us, as we sat on comfortable floor pillows and deployed face and ear scratches. One guy working there was really helpful, friendly, and just overall chatty with us. (Wish I remembered your name, but you were awesome, dude!) He had an affinity for one of the cats, Liza, and even passed her over to me, as she's a big fan of sleeping on laps. Indeed, I got a good five minutes of Liza / Allison cuddle time before she moved off to the next warm lap. The facility itself, for those wondering about the possible well-being of said cats, is pretty immaculate. Strict rules are in place for us, the customers, and they are easy to abide by. The cats' cages, beds, food, litter boxes, et al, are kept in a separate room, though a decorative cut-out hole in the wall allows cats easy access. Surprisingly, I was surprised at how little cat hair I saw, save for a bit on the floor pillows. Finally, unless I'm ""nose blind"", it did not smell like cats in there. For those that don't know, the cats are up for adoption through Kitty Kind. Many were on their way to new homes in the upcoming week. How wonderful! Though I'm in no position to adopt a cat now, in the future, I'd be so happy to do it through this organization.Unfortunately, since we came late, we didn't get a chance to walk over to the associated cafe to grab a few bites before coming to the actual Meow Parlour, but! There is always next time! What a wonderful and unique way to spend a Friday evening!

I finally got the chance and had delicious ginger tea with huge chunks of fresh ginger, fresh squeezed orange/lemon juice and the Club Champs-Élysées sandwich. The drinks were really tasty and the sandwich was scrumptious - made with thin slivers of eggplant, zucchini, roasted tomatoes, mozzarella, pinenuts and more. It was so delicious and didn't fall short in the taste test. The restaurant/tearoom is gorgeous and the staff were very nice. There is one downside, however. I would suggest the slices of bread for the sandwich get upgraded to a hugher quality bread. It maybe the typical bread used to make club sandwiches, but for me, it brings back childhood memories of slices of white bread like Bunny Bread, Sunbeam bread and Wonder Bread mom used to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I was expecting a higher quality at a famous upscale French tearoom/restaurant.

I will say that one thing that's been ordered consistently (and by that, I mean every time I've eaten here) is the Truffled Mac & Cheese Bites. No need to explain right?It can get crazy crowded, crazy fast due to the Midtown lunch-crunch so if you have a larger group, make reservations beforehand!",10,0.9891

666,26,35,4.0,"Oh dear I'm afraid yellow privilege really got the best of me this time. I've been going to Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles for years and only JUST realized --after reading a review lamenting the dumpling sauce-- that y'all wide-eyes don't have the recipe for a basic dumpling sauce stored in your DNA, inherited from one dynasty to the next.So!I'm gonna tell you what to do, for those times when you don't know what to dip your dumplings into.First off, the dumplings here are truly amazing. No hard little meat anchors here! These dumplings use plenty of napa cabbage to create a juicy, tender, not-too-greasy, filing. The ones I had today were particularly beautifully-made, like freakin' origami. Architectural, brah.Anyway, ok, so the bare bones dumpling sauce only has two ingredients, and they are: Black Vinegar + Soy Sauce. Dats it. The vinegar is sharp and sweet and balances out the earthy and savory soy sauce. And they work perfectly together like a pair of antagonistic muscles in Michael Phelps' swimmery shimmery bodice.If you wanna fancy it up, you can add hot sauce, or sesame oil (not too much eh) and that's basically it. I think one of the hot sauces on the table has crushed garlic in it? That's niiiice.About this place: well, it's super cheap and it's super good. The broth doesn't come to the table particularly salted, it's got this pure animal bone taste that is just heavenly. And then you dress it up to your liking. But man, what a base to work with! It's like building a mountain when you are already on another mountain.The pan-fried noodles are shockingly delicious. Again, seasoned with a light hand. But even before you add any sauces to it, the frickin' thing tastes like pleasure incarnate. Something about the oil they use and how it adheres to the chewy, perfectly-cooked noodles... makes my stomach get all emo in a good way.What else --the cold cucumber is great, with a well-balanced sauce. And service is quick and happy. Tip them well, you cheap bastards!",34,0.9965
667,9,8,4.0,Seriously had no idea what to expect. Came here with my friend Arianna O. I was in such a rush that I actually didn't get a shot on my way in.We ended up sitting above which meant a partial view (we couldn't see the people sitting below us) but meant we were relatively safe from being targeted during the show. Although it also meant little leg room and sitting on stools for the entire time.Prepare to be entertained and don't take it too seriously and you'll have a great time. I now have a whole new appreciation for Macbeth. Glad I got to experience something so different like this here in NYC!,11,0.9789
668,9,6,4.0,"I used to work in the West Village, so I passed by Cafe Espanol a million times but I never gave it a second thought. It always had the look of a tourist trap type place, but thanks to the prodding of Tom K. and Tricia K., a group of us wound up going to this awesome spot for dinner recently. While the restaurant was quite full in the front, our party of five was quickly ushered into a back seating area (that we had no idea existed) and were given a nice big table where we all sat comfortably. Nearby was a bar and a rest room in convenient (but not gross) proximity. For a Friday night, it was ideal.Instead of just having entrees on our own, we decided on a strategy of a couple entrees on the table with a pile of tapas. Here's the breakdown of some of the more memorable dishes I had that night:Pulpo al Café EspañolFeaturing sautéed octopus w/ chopped onions, garlic, parsley and wine this was some of the most tender octopus I've ever had in a restaurant. No rubbery chewiness, just melt in your mouth goodness with a wonderful, light flavor.Croquetas de Jamon y PolloCroquettes featuring serrano ham and chicken, these delights were crunchy on the outside and bursting with flavor on the inside.Tortilla EspañolaTraditional Spanish omelet with potato, onion and egg. This thing was serious comfort food. Every bite felt like you were being hugged. It was that good.Boquerones Marinated anchovies (fresh) in olive oil with minced garlic. This is a dish that bursts with flavor if you combine all three items. Add in some of the awesome bread they serve with dinner and you have a treat in a bite!We also had the Paella Valenciana (sausage, chicken, seafood and saffron rice) as a shared entree. The dish was good. The texture was nice and there was plenty of seafood to be had. Was it the best Paella I had ever had in my life? No. Was it great enough that I'd order it again? Absolutely!Service was courteous, professional and quick. From the hostess to our waitstaff, I never found anyone lacking.I feel bad I looked Cafe Espanol over as many times as I had in the past. I look forward to my next visit!",17,0.9973
669,11,2,4.0,"Tips for a great experience:- dress up for a special night- get an early ticket time, arrive on time, and wander around the space- say yes to any invitation presented to you and leave any jealousy or resistance at the door... remember it's all for fun and show- follow performers when they grab people and see what happens, being a spectator can be just as much fun as being a participant- the advantage to tickets above gala level are unlimited cocktails (beyond the entry cocktail and table wine) and a dedicated table you can sit at before and after the performance- the advantage to gala seats is more interaction during the performance as your table may become a part of the show or a piece of stage- choose a smaller table if you're hungry, larger if you aren't- empty the wine carafes at least once before dinner is over - barter for additional food with tables who have fewer people- during the show- laugh, clap, make some noise and encourage the performers who put a lot of themselves into the show- enjoy yourself, it's a beautifully performed show of acrobatics meets cabaret with some teasing and fun thrown in :)If sexual teasing or close encounters with strangers makes you VERY uncomfortable:- arrive closer to 8pm so there's no time to explore before the show- stay in the middle of the crowded bar before the show starts- don't wander around the space until the show is doneYou'll still see a beautiful and sexy acrobatic cabaret show with dinner, but you'll miss some of the things that make this a unique experience.",29,0.9631
670,12,11,4.0,"""Life is too short,"" they said. ""Eat the cheese."" And so I did--along with fried chicken. No shame, no pain...all gains.I came here a few weeks ago with a friend who suggested we get the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Melt--hold up, FRIED CHICKEN in a grilled cheese? That sounds unusual (I admit I'm not a huge grilled cheese fan), but it was surprisingly delicious because of all the perfect, different ingredients and tastes composed in one--crispy, savory, sourish, creamy, and a hint of spicy.I couldn't wait to go back after that, so I ordered the Truffle Melt the next time I went back. I was really looking forward to this; I am a self-proclaimed truffle aficionado and the thought of it way before I finally got my hands on it, made me drool (literally). Flavor was great and there was a huge truffle presence with a nice touch of arugula, but I expected more. Even though I expected a chunky sandwich as big as the Fried Chicken, I was not disappointed. This didn't get me really full as did the Fried Chicken, and had it not been for LevelUp, I don't think I'd ever pay full-price for them. I'll definitely come back if there's a deal because they have some of the most creative grilled cheese sandwiches in the city, but pricey. The Shop Tots are also pretty good and cheesy (as expected).There are only about 4 small tables in here, so it's hard to find seating sometimes since it's a busy shop. The staff is friendly and accommodating here, which is always a plus!",16,0.9922

672,17,18,4.0,"Oink oink oink piggy piggy piggyI always get the same thing every time I go to a Filipino restaurant: Longinizza with a side of garlic rice, and a salad, so I can neglect and complain about how much I hate salads. If I was a rabbit, I still wouldn't eat a salad; I'd be a cute rabbit though, one of those bacon eating bunnies that smell good all the time.Anywho, yeah... the first time I've been to a Filipino restaurant... WITH NO LONGINIZZA, dun dun duuuuuuuuuuun (and garlic rice). It didn't really ruin my night because I was feeling adventurous, so I opted for the Sizzling Sisig. Nothing quite says adventure like a mutilated pig head does. At first I didn't want to go for it because the Adobo sounded amazing with it's garlic flavors, and my Filipino friend whom I went with recommended the Sisig, and I was in the mood to spite him for fun. You know, gotta assert your dominance sometimes *gorilla noises*, but it sounded too good to pass up.My friend ordered something else, I don't care, my food tasted too good to pay attention to his dish. So, that's how I felt about that *thumbs up*. The bowl of coconut rice comes in a decent size, which is beautiful because I was in no mood to spend extra money, so my friend had enough of his rice to share hehehe. There's a smoothness to the sweetness in the coconut rice, the kind of smooth I'd expect from the lips of that anorexic girl I have a crush on (must find a way to get her boyfriend out of the picture).The last thing I want to talk about was the first thing that caught my eye: ""Add any whiskey to your tea"". Yeah, two of my favorite things in the world combined, something I imagine a refined caveman would enjoy drinking. I got the Ginger Darjeeling with their only choice of whiskey (I forgot); it comes in a small pot, so you don't have to worry about getting a tiny cup, and when I got it, there was a sweet musk to it. One of the better smelling liquids I've ever smelt, if you ask me. The delight ends there though, it tasted like complete ass. Complete $7 down the toilet ass. Don't get it. Make it and feed it to your children when they're misbehaving but for the love of tea and whiskey, don't pay for it.",17,0.9948
673,13,5,4.0,"The pedestrian plaza outside this building has always been a popular gathering spot for Harlemites.  Over the years, I can remember attending many memorable events that were celebrated on the Plaza here.  Everything from weekly summer music concerts to the annual Christmas tree lighting during the holiday season where Christmas carolers fan out along to 125th Street. There's also a weekly farmer's market on Tuesdays and Thursdays during the summer and fall that has gone on for years. And you'll without a doubt always find an impromptu circle of drummers, drumming around the base of the statue of the plaza's namesake-- the outspoken 1960's Harlem Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.There's also been many political and social events celebrated here as well, like when Nelson Mandela was first released from prison and he came here to speak, and when Barack Obama was sworn in as the 44th President. And of course, we cannot forget Bill Clinton speaking here when he decided to locate his post-presidential office only a block away after completing his Presidency.Throughout the year, you'll also find a mix of local street vendors selling their T-shirts and handcrafted wares to tourists on the sidewalk outside the Plaza.  Just sitting for a spell along the landscaped concourse is a favorite pastime for many of the shoppers and office workers that converge on the Plaza during the day. While at night it's left to couples who prefer sitting more intimately under the moonlit sky.The AC Powell Plaza is the place to go to experience the heartbeat of Harlem, and in my mind it will always be the Times Square of this community.",13,0.9544
674,19,14,4.0,"Roc-N-Ramen is a solid 3.8/5.0 in my books and here's why.They're as authentic a ramen shop as you'll get befitting of New Rochelle and especially the cold winter months. Their decor is different in that it strikes me as if it was a former sushi restaurant, although this in itself could be attributed to the lighting.I discovered it with a good friend earlier this week as it appeared relatively new. It'll definitely hit the spot when you're hangry for a ramen fix and can't find yourself motivated to trek into the city.As compared to my top favorites from the city, Totto, Ippudo, Misoya Ramen, and Minca, they do a good job but clearly have to work hard to come close. Upon closer inspection though, they evoke memories of Ramen Setagaya in East Village, the Japanese chain that came to the 'States offering decent ramen. It does the trick. For New Rochelle though, this should be considered quite a feat!They have some further kinks to work out in this relatively new restaurant but for your ramen needs, this ought to be your destination if you're in the area.",24,0.8361

676,17,11,4.0,"My first time at Uva was quite the satisfying experience, and the fact we were lucky enough to score outdoor seating under our reservation was perhaps a contributing positive factor. Reservations seem practical and necessary for here, as well as a request for the outdoor seating if dining at night. We came on a Friday at 6:30PM, and while all things seemed pleasant outside, it exemplified the opposite inside, which remained very noisy and crowded as the night went on. Not too surprising though as Uva offers much to an Italian dining experience. Grab a date, a friend, or small group of friends, as the ambiance carries itself as largely intimate, romantic, and cozy. Though I'll emphasize again the outdoor space should the weather be nice. They have a small outdoor patio space at the very back which provides a pleasant atmosphere for quieter dining. We placed an order of the appetizer, Polpettine di Vitello (mini veal meatballs cooked in tomato sauce, served with Ciabatta bread) to share. For main entrees, I chose the Pappardelle Al Ragu di Vitello (pasta ribbons with ragout of veal and montasio cheese). My guest had the Cavatelli Al Pesto (pasta shells in creamy pesto with ricotta cheese). The veal meatballs, I could have passed on. Meatballs were tasty and the sauce was indeed savory though. First I'll note the portions here are generous, and my guest and I were unable to finish our own entrees. But, had there been no limitation to how much one can eat, I'd continue to indulge on Uva's offerings. Their pasta is amazing, and I can't imagine one going wrong with any of their menu choices. The quality and preparation of the pasta was excellent, in my opinion. I really enjoyed the Pappardelle. This is one of their most popular dinner choices. My guest's Cavatelli was very rich and delicious. I'd love to try the Gnocchi di Ricotta on my next visit. When it comes to Italian, Uva has a lot to offer. The food was exceptional, the atmosphere was very nice, and the service was no issue. Again, the seating indoors was very noisy, but I recommend the outdoor seating if the weather is nice. If you're venturing in the Upper East Side and looking for quality Italian dining, I highly recommend this venue.",21,0.9892

About 4 minutes later my phone buzzed that our table was ready. So we finished up and went back. We were seated ""outside"" on the covered patio. They had heaters (and I knew we were about to eat steaming bowls of soup) so it wasn't so bad, but it was cold enough that we had to keep our jackets on the whole time. So, not ideal. To start we got the sauteed Chinese greens, which I would highly recommend, and the pork meatballs. The meatballs were good but not stellar, lightly fried and topped with bonito. For our ramen bowls, I got the Tokyo Shiyo (salty) and he got the Tokyo Shoyu (sweet). The biggest differences between the two were in the broth. The delicious rye noodles and simple green onion and pork toppings were the same. I slurped the whole thing up. All in all, it was a solid meal.

681,15,11,4.0,"So it would seem that Kitty's Canteen is halfway between a private club and a regular restaurant. I randomly was asked to dinner by a couple that knows the owner, but I'm not sure how you can get a table otherwise. We went on a Wednesday at 7, and there was only like one other party there the whole time which I thought was kind of strange, but the people I was there with swear it is a big late night spot--the owner also owns that kind of intense burlesque sex show place the Box, so I'll believe it. The kitchen serves up Southern comfort food with a mild Jewish flare--all of it, from what I can tell, delicious. We got their take on biscuits, a tender, buttery biscuit/bagel hybrid coated in poppy- and sesame seeds which I believe were called biscels? A little basket was $7, with the options to add on a variety of delicious toppings each for I think $7 each? We got the works, with pastrami, smoked salmon, fried chicken, pickles, and maybe something else? They each came with delicious sauces, which I don't necessarily remember in their entirety but included mustard, horseradish cream, and honey butter. It was a huge amount of food, but great to split in a big group. Almost everyone at the table got the fried chicken, but I am nothing if not a contrarian, plus I got a little bite of it with the biscuits. From that little sample, it seemed really, really good. What I did get was the Kitty's Catch (almost everything on the menu has an awful cheesy cat-themed name), a perfectly cooked cornmeal-crusted trout over a beautiful plate of assorted summer vegetables. Highly recommended. I also tried a bit of the brisket--heavy for summer, but incredibly flavorful. We also tried their obligatory take on a kale salad, which nicely balanced healthy ingredients (quinoa) with yummy salty cheese and a delicious vinaigrette. It was good, but I'd file it under ""this is not why you're here,"" you know? We tried some wonderfully chocolatey dessert and a less fabulous strawberry shortcake (good shortcake, but there was a weird flavor in the strawberries, like an herb or something).Cocktail were quite expensive (starting at $14), but the entrees were, I believe all under $30, which isn't so bad. The restaurant itself is also was pretty great. It's very speakeasy-ish, romantically lit with gorgeous, thousand-dollar-per-yard gold and black wallpaper that artist Molly Crabapple has defaced with drawings of anthopomorphic cats. It's tiny, with brick archways, dim lighting, and a tiny little beautifully-decorated bathroom featuring plenty more of Crabapple's cats. The one downside is that the small space is somewhat awkward, especially in the front alcove where we sat, where the tables seemed quite crammed in.Like I said, I'm not sure if you can actually eat here, but if you get the chance you should definitely go for it.",21,0.9988
682,23,18,4.0,"Indulging in ""research"" at the newly opened Aldo Sohm Wine Bar proved to be dangerous last night... but as always, risks come with their own delicious rewards.After hearing that the executive sommelier from Le Bernardin started his own wine bar nearby, I knew I had to experience it before it became overrun with the entire population of post-work Midtown. We arrived around 5:30pm on a Wednesday and the scene was already bustling. Luckily we were able to grab 2 spots on the central couch which gives you a perfect view of who is coming in while your back is being supported by gigantic pillows. Win-win sitch.The interior design makes me think if the MOMA had a secret wine bar hidden within its walls, this is definitely what it would look like. Framed prints of artwork are all around as well as an eclectic assortment of objects like a violin and a globe. Might have been a statue of a chicken thrown in... but perhaps that was the third glass of Greek white wine talking.The menu is basically all small plates, charcuterie and cheese which is to be nibbled on and shared. I would not suggest bringing a big group here and having a main meal here because 1. that ish will set you back if you're trying to get fully satisfied and 2. there isn't that much space for parties of more than 4 people. This is more of an intimate setting that I think is the step before going to the place you will end up at for the rest of your evening while out.My PIC (or ""partner in crime"" as you will) for the evening and I took no mercy on the menu. We knew we wanted to try a bunch of things but to not commit ourselves to total foodie suicide being a worknight and all. To start, we tried to order The Tower (a serving of ALL of their charcuterie offerings, $45) but were advised against it as it might be too much meat for us to handle. Clearly the man doesn't understand who he is dealing with! We then went with his suggestion of his four favorite meats which were: Cacciatorini Sausage, Austrian Style Poached Ham, Ariane Duck Rilettes and Fireplace Smoked Pork Loin. With charcuterie I must have cheese so we also ordered the Murray's ""Cheese of the Moment"" platter. That came with four cheeses: a goat cheese, a blue cheese, something reminiscent of cheddar and who the hell knows what the fourth one was! Gouda?? I'm losing track of everything! Oh and we also HAD to have the Foie Gras Lollipops... I mean, we'd be absolutely crazy not to.The verdict? I loved EVERYTHING. The meat, the cheese and especially those foie gras lollipops. The foie gras was perfectly cooked and did not have that overwhelming liver taste that foie gras can sometimes have. All the rich flavors came into perfect harmony and just melted in my mouth! At $15 for one, it is pricy but trust me- you will not share it so get your own.The charcuterie + cheese + foie gras were delicious but were we full yet? Nahhhhhhh. Since there was a 1/4 inch spot of room left in our bellies we decided to also order the Truffle Pasta (with grated yak cheese) and the Short Rib Skewer (with fried shallot, red wine reduction)... Yeah I know what you must be thinking. What a bunch of fat asses! Well, so what! That Truffle Pasta is worth getting fat over... I could eat a few more bowls of that anytime, anywhere. If the sound of buttery, truffle pasta covered with freshly grated yak cheese doesn't get your saliva flowing then you must be dead! The Short Rib Skewer was just as yummy with tender, juicy meat that needed no knife to cut it.Yup, I am a fan... and come winter, I can see myself shacking up in here quite often to keep myself warm and cozy from the unwelcome cold. There's good food, excellent wine choices and lots of eye candy to boot. Move over Aldo, you have a permanent after-work tenant!Oh and speaking of Aldo, we spotted Mr. Sohm himself going around the room talking with patrons and shaking hands. We asked our waiter if he could stop by our table so we could say hello, thank you and congratulate him opening such a lovely little spot. He unfortunately was not able to but fingers crossed for next time! Till then, run run on over here while you still can.",25,0.996

I Yelped, of course, and there were a few in the area, but this one had high marks and an ample number of reviews. I walked on over. I got there and every single seat was full and there were about three people waiting. I'm fairly impatient and had to get in and out to make my dinner reservation, so I assumed I wouldn't be able to stay and wait. A friendly guy came over asking what services I wanted. I told him just a manicure and asked how long the wait was. ""7-10 minutes!"" he cheerily exclaimed. I figured I was already right near the restaurant, and if the wait time was truly as short as he said, I could stay. I find that many, many times when a nail salon tells you 10 minutes or 5 minutes, they are LIARS. At Pink Blossom, they were not. Literally 5 minutes later I was whisked off to a chair and my manicure was started. It was quick, the space was clean, decent color selection, and the pricing was fair. I will say they could have done a better job on my cuticles, but other than that, no complaints. I knew they weren't being thorough on my cuticles when I was sitting there, but had to get to dinner so I just sort of let it go.While I sat there, more and more women came in. The man who greeted me did a great job or organizing everyone and getting people seen right away. Of note: Tips only in cash. Credit cards accepted otherwise.

It was absolutely great and reasonably priced. The portion size is really good for 1 person and it's really fresh and crunchy. A great dish on a warm summer day.

Chinese Soy Milk - Dou Jiang - Sweet, but not enough to get you diabetes - About $1Please also note that the guy who runs the store doesn't speak English very well.

688,9,10,4.0,"Well, I'm always complaining about the lack of quality brunches on the Upper West Side and Cafe Luxembourg has certainly shut me up. Literally, because the food is so good and it makes me just want to eat in silence.So let's get to the most important offerings at Cafe Luxembourg. Their brunch items are simply top notch. Among the items I have tried.. I find it hard to rank -- it really depends on what floats your boat, I guess. The huevos rancheros is served with flavourful black beans, beautifully poached eggs and 2 yummy salsas. I still did ask for tabasco though - pardon me. The french toast is incredible - moist brioche that melts in your mouth, with a tangy melange of berries, and this amazing fromage blanc stuffed in it. It's fantastic. Also fantastic, albeit less indulgent, is the vegetable hash with eggs and sriracha dressing. It's not spicy, but it's a flavour bomb. I suspect these folks use some high quality ingredients. I have also eaten here with carnivores and both the lobster roll and the smoked salmon dishes were greatly appreciated. They have a pretty delicious prosecco, but the sparkling rose is a bit underwhelming. Of course you could be boring and order the orange juice or the chamomile tea. :)They are incredibly welcoming of children, and let me back in although my toddler broke a plate the first time that we ate here. Lastly, they offer these creamy dark chocolates with your check, and I'm hoping that I can buy these by the dozen.The place has this whole Parisian cafe feel to it, which is lovely when you're stuck in Manhattan in the summer with no time for a vacation. While the space can feel a bit cramped at times, the service is incredibly warm and friendly, and the food is delicious. What's not to like?",15,0.9898
689,12,12,4.0,"I have a good time every time I go to Red Rooster. I've been going off and on since they opened 4 years ago. I usually take someone that's visiting Harlem for the first time and we have a blast listening to the live music, meeting new people at the community tables, dancing downstairs before it became Ginny's and even meeting Marcus in person. The food is pretty amazing with great influences from many countries. Never had a meal here that I didn't like. And the atmosphere is A+.Unfortunately, though, sometimes the music is blaring and I have to move to outside seating to enjoy myself. Another con is that some of the items are pricey - $30 for a small bowl of Shrimp and Grits (4 peices of shrimp) - is something a friend ordered and shared. I have to say it was possibly the creamiest bowl of grits I've tasted in my life, but $30 is more than price gauging in my opinion. I would say this is one of those dishes that possibly only tourist consider buying. Being that I can make this at home for $5 makes this price laughable.",14,0.8921
690,12,7,4.0,"I really like this bar and have been here numerous times. The only negative are the guys who do security at the door. They are always very strict/rough with everyone, so it's very uncalled for.The dress code is strict, so don't come in full on ""street clothes"". After you do get through the door, you go through a curtain and enter the main seating area. On the slower nights you can just sit at any of the tables and a server will take care of you. However, on the busier nights it is very rare that you'll even get a table as they'll probably be reserved anyways. I prefer sitting at the table and getting a server, however if that is not the case, you must go to the bar for a drink.The drinks here are really great and the bartenders really pay attention to detail. The drinks take a little time to make, but it is totally worth it, so don't come here trying to get a red bull vodka.On a couple of the slower nights I came they had a jazz band playing, which was pretty awesome. On the busier nights they were playing current and old school hip-hop and pop.",13,0.9676
691,8,4,4.0,"Come here to binge on eating and people watching! It was that rare sunny-beautiful-perfect day in New York City, and lines stretched long on the first open day of the spring (May 4). I was walking to meet my friend for lunch at Schnipper's, when she texted me and said that Madison Sq. Eats was opening that day. I did a quick google search on the offerings, and said hell yes!Hungry hoards of food hunters grumbled at the long lines on that sunny day, but in the end everyone was having a merry time. Come on, that's why you go to these things- you can find most of these places at their brick-and-mortar locations, but honestly we masochistically love the feeling of waiting in line and feeling like we accomplished something when we FINALLY order! Ok, well, the wide selection all in one place is fun too. Most of the offerings are not cheap, but pretty interesting. It was a tough decision- you could definitely spend a lot of time deciding, or a lot of money trying everything. Go with a group so you can sneak tastes of their food too!I would have loved to try Pig + Khao's adobo, La Sonrisa Empanadas, Arancini Bros rice balls (please serve some vegan ones next time!), and Bar Suzette's crepes. We ended up selecting Seoul Lee's bulgogi bibimbap and Takumi Taco's lunch box (2 tacos and a side). The bulgogi bibimbap definitely hit the spot. The meat was tender, moist, and very well marinated. Perfect bulgogi consistency! Paired with the spicy mayo and veggies and mixed with the rice- I was scraping the bowl clean!Takumi Taco's short rib taco was meh, and the spicy tuna taco could have had more kick to it. The spicy tuna's delicate flavor was good though. Skip the rice and beans side, it was too bland and we added it to our bulgogi bowl to soak up the goodness. I definitely thought the $12 price tag was steep for this. I was so happy basking in the warmth around my favorite things, food and people.",8,0.9978

693,9,9,4.0,"I normally wouldn't pivot an entire review around a comparison to another restaurant, but when you decide to start up a new Cajun seafood boil a few blocks away from The Boil, you do naturally lend yourself to that comparison. So the question really is: how does Claw Daddy's compare to The Boil? And the answer is: it's complicated. But that's only so because both are terrific in their own way. So, to summarize, here's a point-by-point breakdown of the two excellent establishments. And now, let the fight begin...Wait time: At The Boil, expect to wait up to two hours for a table on a Friday or Saturday during peak dinner hours. And while it's worth the wait, Claw Daddy's actually takes reservations so there's no need to hang around the bar for hours on end (though I suppose you may still want to do that). Winner: Claw Daddy'sPayment: The Boil is cash only while Claw Daddy's accepts credit cards. That should be simple enough. Winner: Claw Daddy'sDecor: Claw Daddy's space is much bigger and more open which is nicer and less repellent to the mildly claustrophobic than The Boil's much smaller room. Claw Daddy's also has televisions, which normally wouldn't be a draw, but there happened to be a football game I wanted to catch that night so that was a big win. Winner: Claw Daddy'sMenu: The menus at the two restaurants are nearly identical. In fact, Claw Daddy's has the exact same combination specials that The Boil has at the same prices, plus a couple more for good measure. And while I haven't sampled from the raw bar of either, Claw Daddy's has a wider selection of options. Winner: Claw Daddy'sSpiciness: My philosophy is the spicier, the better. The Boil's hottest spice level, Fire, is pretty impressive, but Claw Daddy's Insane spice level, which uses Trinidad Moruga Scorpion peppers, has the slight edge. Winner: Claw Daddy'sSauce: Of all the considerations listed here, the sauce might just be the most important since it has a huge impact on how good the meal as a whole tastes as well. Claw Daddy's sauce is very tasty but it's lighter and thinner than The Boil's rich, creamy broth. The Boil's sauce somehow seems to absorb the flavor of seafood much better as well. Winner: The BoilPotato: Unfortunately, the potato at Claw Daddy's seemed like it wasn't cooked all the way through. A little to hard and dry for my taste, especially compared to The Boil, where the potatoes truly add something to the meal. Winner: The BoilService: At The Boil, the servers help sauce-proof you by helping tie a lobster bib around your neck. No such pampering at Claw Daddy's where you're left to figure out how to tie it yourself. All in all, while not bad, the service at The Boil has an edge. Winner: The BoilIt's hard to pick a clear winner between the two, and I'm going to save myself the trouble of doing that. There are some aspects of Claw Daddy's make it a better experience than The Boil while there are others which aren't quite up to par. Really, you can't go wrong with either and it might just come down to what you're looking for.",25,0.9991
694,11,8,4.0,"Sylvia's is a well established southern style soul-food joint in Harlem on Lenox Ave and 127th. It is privately owned and operated, but has been here so long there are nationally distributed cookbooks, sauces and other branded goodies you can get all over.We opted to sit outside on the nice summer day and were promptly seated and given a basket of warm, freshly-cooked cornbread -- so delicious!It was tough to decide, but we ordered the Chicken & Waffles platter and the Ribs & Chicken platter, both of which came with a complimentary drink (including a few alcoholic selections). We ordered the tastier dark meat for both of the chicken orders, and got Collard Greens and Baked Mac & Cheese for the complimentary sides.The waffle was light and fluffy on the inside, but browned properly on the outside. The chicken thigh was moist and tender, but crispy and well fried on the outside. Not too much fried batter, but not too little either. The fried batter was not too greasy, but full of flavor.There was nothing wrong with the ribs per-se, but they weren't spectacular. The sauce that was on them was great -- sweet and tangy, with a little kick -- but the ribs were not as tender as I would have liked them to be. I had to work a little to clean the bones. Collard greens were excellent, but the Mac and Cheese was average.If ribs are what you are after, you would probably be best to go to a dedicated Ribs joint, but the Fried Chicken was outstanding here, and the value is very good with all the complimentary offerings on the low-priced combos.",17,0.9971
695,7,5,4.0,"An alternate name of this restaurant could be ""Clams on Clams on Clams,"" although there were a few other options on the menu that featured other seafood as well as chicken and a strip loin. I would highly recommend sticking with their clam dishes as they were the highlight of the night!We made a reservation for 4 people a couple of weeks in advance. Our reservation was at 6 pm and soon after 6 pm, the restaurant was packed with a more sophisticated crowd of West Village natives and a few yuppie couples. The space feels airy and clean. The ceiling is bedazzled with hundreds of pearlescent square tiles and exposed brick added a nice homey touch. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and didn't rush us when making our decisions. We decided to start with the Campechana Coctel de Camaron. This appetizer is a good choice for groups. The dip consisted of hearty chunks of clam, marinara sauce, lime, and avocados - delicious! I highly recommend it!For our entrees, we ordered the Spaghetti & Clams, Clam Fried Rice, and the Block Island Swordfish with a side of Asparagus. The Spaghetti & Clams was delicious and the presentation was nice - 5 clams around a heaping pile of spaghetti in clam spicy gravy with a leafy bunch of arugula atop the pasta. The spicy gravy was not as spicy, but more salty than I had expected. I appreciated how Chef Price was not stingy at all about the clam in the pasta. I'd even go out on a limb to say it was 60% pasta, 40% clam in spicy gravy.The Clam Fried Rice was my favorite and also less salty than my Spaghetti & Clams dish. There was a medley of pork belly confit, snow peas, and pickled onion that really brought a lot of flavor to the dish without being overwhelmingly salty.Chef Mike Price must be a fan of the miniature croutons as they appeared in the swordfish dish as well as the side of asparagus. The Black Island Swordfish had great presentation, but the dish itself wasn't too amazing in my opinion. Then again, I'm not a huge fan of fish entrees in general. The Grilled Asparagus was pretty delicious. The presentation was nice and the croutons really worked in this dish to add texture. By the end of our meal, we were stuffed and decided to hold back on the dessert, but I'm sure I'll be back in the future for more bivalves and hopefully, this time I'll save room for dessert!",13,0.9961

All of them were tasty and - given the prices of cocktails in the now ubiquitous ""cocktail bar"" elsewhere - not too expensive.

698,8,5,4.0,"Amali came up in a search for a brunch spot in Manhattan this past weekend. Its name comes from the term used for lands once shared by the places we know today as Greece, Italy and Turkey. This restaurant emphasizes sustainable ingredients with a Mediterranean style of food, both very appealing in today's culinary world.Right from the outside seating area, Amali gives a very comforting feel. Inside, the atmosphere is very much like another world. A combination of a long bar, some paintings on the wall and an an area in the back with natural sunlight flooding in from above makes this a comfortable and lovely place to eat. My girlfriend and I chose to sit in the back area, wanting to enjoy the lighting.Service was very prompt. I had just come from a workout so I was drinking water like a camel and the server who kept refilling my water was very gracious about it. Our waiter was a very nice, funny and soft spoken gent who was efficient to boot. Oddly, he did not recognize what a ""Yelp Check-In Offer"" was (for the record, there is a 10% off lunch or brunch Yelp check-in offer) so this particular meal didn't get the 10% off. I just saved it for later and figured next time I'll mention it before I'm seated. Really, it wasn't a huge deal to me.So here's what we enjoyed during our visit:BUTTERMILK BISCUITSServed with jam and honey butter. These are not the gigantic, fluffy biscuits you may think of when you think of places like KFC. Instead, these were relatively thin and almost cookie like, but they were absolutely buttery and delicious. They had a crisp crunch on the outside but a nice soft interior. With the honey butter and jam they were utterly delightful.SPANISH OCTOPUSWith castelveltrano olives, yukon potatoes, wild oregano. This dish was amazing. The octopus was cooked perfectly. The oregano and olive oil drizzled over it gave it a wonderful flavor. I'd order this again in a heartbeat.SHRIMP & GRITSFeaturing three tiger prawns served on top of polenta. The shrimp were beautifully cooked and still in the shell. If you enjoy crunching down and drinking the juices of shrimp, you'll love this. The shrimp meat was nicely cooked, not overdone at all and the juices from the shrimp added to the flavor of the polenta. The polenta was very creamy and tasted great. POACHED EGGSServed with sautéed escarole, pecorino on top and grilled ciabatta. This was probably my least favorite dish, but not because anything was wrong with it. I'm just not a huge escarole fan. However, my girlfriend is and she enjoyed it a lot. The eggs were poached perfectly and the runny yolk was perfect on the ciabatta. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and Amali, and even with the hiccup regarding the Yelp Check-In offer I'm giving it high marks for a wonderful atmosphere, great staff and wonderful food.",11,0.9988

I sampled a flavor or two, then tried my luck with the cookies and cream + chocolate flavors. I added blueberries, strawberries and kiwis like the wannabe health nut that I am.

The waiter kept telling us with a smile ""I'm going to do for you..."" but never mentioned financial sodomy in his repertoire . Ordinarily price isn't an issue but the steak for two was obnoxiously priced. Moreover, the waiter showed us what he said was a dry-aged, well marbled, USDA prime grade, Porterhouse steak for two. I couldn't tell whether is was dry aged but the marbling of the steak revealed that is was USDA choice and not prime (or the lowest grade of prime - there are three grades but nobody ever mentions this).The waiter somehow forgot to mention that the steak was $180! This is the most I ever paid for a choice steak for two in Manhattan. Hell this is the most I've ever paid for a 'prime' steak for two! It tasted good but...The super-hot Venezuelan hostess aside, the food was interesting and surprisingly good. I can't recall what else we ordered but we managed to finish whatever came to our table--whether it was ours to not.

701,13,7,4.0,"We were invited to try out the club and while we are considering joining, this review is just for the food we've had for dinner. We started off with a strawberry gazpacho with shrimps and avocado. This first course was amazing! It was very refreshing, very tasty and flavorful and the plate looked gorgeous! It came with 3 shrimps, which I find to be a fair serving for the given plate, they were very fresh, clearly cooked on the premises and never frozen. I loved it. The creaminess, the richness, and still very subtle! I couldn't taste any strawberries in it tho, I didn't mind, the soup was amazing. For the second course, I had the halibut with broccoli and asparagus and my husband had the chicken with some sort of puree and vegetables. Both plates were very delicious, but oh SO SMALL. Seriously, the portions were ridiculously small, ridiculous, almost a joke small. That said, my 2 inch square of fish was amazing, perfectly cooked, gently seasoned, the 4 asparagus heads I was given were perfectly grilled, and the two baby broccoli florets kept the crunch I love so much. My husband's plate had a similar plot: amazing 2 inch square of chicken, fantastic tablespoon of puree and delicate mouthful of veggies. Finally, the dessert! It's called the trio of desserts, we had a sliver of tiramisu, a spoonful of creme brulee, one strawberry and one blackberry. Each dessert was very delicious and delicate, the strawberry was perfectly cut in the middle and one knows that takes a special hand. All that said, the food was amazing, but it felt more like a sampler meal that an actual meal. Maybe we are used to having huge plates, but I have a solid appetite and these were no decent sizes at all, so it doesn't matter if members get to eat for free with their guests, if they have to go back out and get a slice of pizza or froyo afterwards, it's not too cool either. We went out afterwards and got froyo... So I will love to go back, maybe even be a member but take this meal as a light meal or big snack. It isn't filling in size, but I guess if you are taking your time and just enjoying, it's cool, but if you rely on this as a real dinner, make sure you have your fill from a late lunch.",21,0.9983
702,21,12,4.0,"Root and Bone - the name of the restaurant alludes to fresh produce and meat and that's exactly what is offered in their dishes. Add in a dash of creativity, lovely Southern charm, and the work of two former Top Chef contestants, and you have yourself quite a winning restaurant.The interior looks a bit like an open cottage with muted grays and browns; splashes of color can be found in the hanging terrariums, tiny flowers on the wall, mismatched plates at each table, and in the food itself. The larger room even has a large china cabinet and it's exactly that cozy, open feel that really brings out the restaurant's farm-to-table quality.The fried chicken n' waffle sandwich (named ""Avenue A"" on the lunch menu) was really quite divine. Two small round sandwiches came per order, and the buns were replaced with soft cheddar waffles. I was expecting a bit of a crisp edge to the waffles, but they were instead soft; they surprisingly held the large chunks of fried chicken well. The chicken pieces were prepared in a maple whiskey brine and were SO juicy. The bright pickled green tomato slices and bits of watercress were nice accents and balanced out the sandwiches, preventing them from becoming overbearingly sweet and heavy.The jazzed (tarred??...the menu's font was hard to read) feathered fried chicken sandwich (named ""Avenue B"" on the lunch menu) had the same juicy fried chicken, but it was spiked with Tabasco for a real kick. The sandwich also came with bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and potato rolls, but the greatest part was the buttermilk ranch sauce. Or so I'm told. J liked this sandwich so much that he devoured it before I could steal a bite. We also ordered a side of Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits (gosh, look at that name!) which were served with honey butter and peach preserves. Three squarish biscuits came per order. The spreads were good, but the biscuits themselves were a bit dry. This was the only negative note from the meal. Root and Bone also offers twelve different cocktails and a wine list that leans toward American and Australian wines. If all of the cocktails sound great, it's most likely because they are. If you have difficulty picking, try the Filthy Manahttan! The ratio of whiskey, port, and bitters was fantastic. The amarena cherries left at the bottom of the glass were so boozily decadent. Likelihood of another visit:There are so many other menu items I'd love to try: peach caprese, the ""BLT that will tickle you pickle"", the short rib meatloaf, and the waffle benedict to name a few. There is an adjacent market, the Little Root Market, that sells its buckets of fried chicken and sandwiches to go and I think it's a convenient stop for a quick lunch if you're in Alphabet City.",26,0.9939
703,9,7,4.0,"If I had never read about this spot on Yelp, the I would have never had gone to Sake Bar Decibel. Tucked away inconspicuously in the East Village, there is barely a sign. To compound the inconspicuousness of this place, it's underground, making your search for this spot a tad more difficult. Nonetheless, the times that I've been here, I've had an incredibly chill time drinking and hanging out with friends. Sake Bar Decibel isn't what I'd call a ""nice"" bar. It's kind of grungy, but at the same time it's not Continental-level grungy. When you walk downstairs and enter this underground sake bar, you're instantly transformed into a scene straight out of old school Japan. With the paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling, compounded with the dim lighting and compact seating gives this place a somewhat intimate feel. The times that I've come here, it wasn't overly packed, so we were able to get seated at a table seamlessly, as well as the ability to talk to each other without yelling across the table. As far as their drink menu goes, you can accurately assume that they have a pretty extensive sake list. I went with my usual Otokoyama which is a Daiginjo. Price-wise, it's not incredibly cheap, but the sake isn't over priced either. Whether or not you order a bottle for the table, or just a carafe for yourself, you're not rushed at all because there's no one standing behind you hovering and hoping that you'll get up and leave the bar. Aside from drinks, they also do serve some food here. Our table ended up ordering some tofu dish that I cant remember the name of, but it was pretty damn good. All in all, Sake Bar Decibel is a great escape from the madness of the East Village. You can actually sit down, relax, and hang out with your friends while enjoying some sake. The decor and atmosphere help compound that laid back feel, while at the same time, transforming you as best as it can, to Japan.",9,0.9929

Although strong shadows persist throughout, this bar is a place to see and be seen while having that $16 cocktail after a hard day's work. Yes it's pricey but you're paying for the ambiance, the crowd and for the remnants of an extravagant era long since passed. This 13th century Florentine style inspired space used to serve as the private salon and office of 20's mogul John W. Campbell starting in 1923. I imagine the roaring spectacle could have been comparable to the barber shop scene from The Great Gatsby, dancing girls and all. After its 1.5 million dollar restoration in 1999 to bring it back to its former glory, this establishment has since lived up to its reputation with its telling tagline ""Cocktails from another era.""While the drinks do rack up quite a hefty bill if you're having more than 1, they do pack a solid punch on your liver. The Prohibition Punch alone will set you back $19 and about 1,900 brain cells. That's the ratio nowadays for price to brain cells killed for a libation just in case you wanted to know. The menu boasts an array of cocktails that should suit every palate but from one alcoholic to another, I believe bourbon is the king of poisons.Besides its history and delicious alcoholic concoctions, The Campbell Apartment is impressive in many ways. Once you are allowed by the army of friendly hostesses to step inside the cavernous room, please take a moment to feed your eyes with the architectural beauty in front of you. First look up... then down... then side to side if visibility permits. Hopefully you will have noticed: the beautiful high-beamed ceilings overhead, the stained glass window residing over the bar, the luxurious carpet beneath your feet, the intrinsically carved woodwork throughout and the enormous stone fireplace to keep everyone toasty 3/4 of the year. Oh and don't forget the original quatrefoil mahogany balcony above you where prey I mean GUYS watch the crowd from ... Yup, they're up there. Watching you. Totally unaware of what's going to happen. *waves to unsuspecting victims*All jokes aside, this is obviously one of the classier joints you will encounter for the after-work drink crowd where real adults convene. If you're lucky enough to stop by later in the evening once the train commuters have left, by all means go right ahead. You'll still have a pretty satisfying collection of mixology enthusiasts plus more elbow room to work your magic. Dress code is strictly enforced which keeps out the accidental tourist, the Air Jordans and the people who wear shorts religiously... or even worse, baseball caps. Seriously Red Sox and Yankees fans, I'm calling you out specifically- we get it. You're obsessed and we're not judging you (as much as we could) but please leave your caps in your closet before you even think about stepping foot into this lounge. This dress code ensures a decently dressed crowd for those of us who love a well tailored suit on a fine looking specimen. So the big question is, will you end up with a trophy at the end of your speakeasy safari? It's hard to say... but if you have a cocktail in hand, exude confidence and throw in an ""elephant gun"" (such as that sexy LBD you've been dying to wear) for good measure, your expedition should prove victorious.Good hunting ladies.",29,0.9976

They're mostly nice and will help explain what stuff is (except when they lie - see below). Be adventurous. Man (or woman) up. It's part of the fun of dim sum.4. Beware the Ides of Meat (and Shellfish).I've been here with people who both are vegetarians and are allergic to shrimp and other various shellfish. In one occasion, we asked the lovely cart lady if there was any shrimp in the dumplings in her cart, and they said no. Lo and behold, we took a nice big bite of our dumplings and there were tons of baby shrimp in thurr. Not sure what would motivate a lady to lie like that-- maybe they didn't understand the question or maybe they secretly work on commission and get paid by the dim sum.5.

There's also a stroller parking area, which scared the hell out of me, but I guess that's what you get in TriBeCa. After work, the bar is absolutely packed - not easy to snag a seat if you're just popping in sans-reservations. The space is really big - There's outdoor seating as well, and the street it's positioned on (Vesey) is relatively quiet in terms of traffic.The decor is cool - I particularly enjoyed a quartet of bedazzled skulls positioned above our round table. We had a reservation, and they seated us pretty quickly after everyone arrived.As far as drinks go, Margaritas are the obvious choice. If you're into frozen vs on the rocks, be sure to ask first, as some are served frozen without it being explicitly pointed out in the menu (the blood orange one, for example.) I wanted to try more than one kind, however, the red bell pepper spicy margarita was so fantastic, I had to stick with it for 2 drinks. I also tried the cucumber one - but gotta stick with red bell pepper. It's made with mescal, so definitely has a smoky kick to it - but it isn't overwhelmingly spicy and tastes like fresh vegetables.Everyone was raving over the nachos on 4sq, so had to give that a shot, as well as the bazooka limon guacamole. The guacamole is served with goat cheese and pistachio - could have gone without the goat cheese, but the pistachios definitely were a nice touch. Might add that to guac I make at home... And the nachos did live up to the hype. They're served in a pizza dish, so each chip has at least 90% coverage of chesse, beans, jalapeños, etc. Our group shared tacos / quesadillas after that, and the standout was 100% the mahi mahi tacos. (Also tried the zucchini blossom quesadilla - fine, but could've probably made it myself - and the grilled fish tacos, which were very good.) The Mahi Mahi is fried fish with spicy chipotle and vegetables, but in a rolled soft tortilla served almost like an enchilada, sans-sauce. They're easy to slice up and share, and SO GOOD. Service was on top of it - the tacos did take a while to arrive, but we were having a good time and already had our nachos & guac. Definitely an easy, solid choice for a more casual business dinner or a bday celebration.",14,0.9971

I made an appointment online (3 weeks in advance - bookings run out quickly!). The office is small but cozily decorated, and there are magazine and Fiji water for those waiting for their appointments.I had the hydrating facial with Jasmine, and enjoyed every minute of it. All the products used smelled heavenly without being overbearing. The extraction process was done by hand & tissues (vs tools - bonus points on being hygienic) and was definitely gentle. My face definitely needed the extra hydration, and looked luminous afterwards without the angry red spots typically associated with status post facials. In fact, I rushed to a class right after and my classmates complimented my skin without knowing I just had a facial.At the end, Jasmine gave me a full assessment of my skin as well as what I should add/subtract from my regimen. I asked Jasmine for recommendations on how to properly hydrate my skin in the NYC weather without weighing it down, and she recommended a very affordable skin care brand that's easily accessible to take care of my problems without breaking the bank. I appreciate that they do not push pricey products on their clientele and is very honest about what works for the client's specific skin type.I will definitely be back in the summer once the heavy humidity sets in.

So far this spot is one of my favorites. I got a tip from a friend and suggested it for an after work happy hour type thing. The one negative that I have to say is getting up there can be a reallll drag. Our group was arriving at different times so that complicated things a bit. The line and wait is generally very long since they do their best not to overcrowd the space, which I can appreciate, but I felt like they took it to an extreme. I was lucky I was even able to get up to join my group....Once you're up there though, all troubles from downstairs are left behind. You step off the elevator and can't help but get the feeling you're not in New York anymore. Instead you're transported to some long forgotten oasis. The vibe up there isn't uppity or super fancy. It's just warm and low key, inviting you to linger for as long as you'd like. And once you're done taking it all in, you mosey on up to the bar, order yourself a nice refreshing beverage and realize you actually are in fact in New York when you see the tab...but you realize it's ok, because you're on this roof.

711,8,8,4.0,"I was told that DBK had the best Restaurant Week menu in NYC, hands down. I think I would have to agree.I usually avoid Restaurant Week, because the majority of restaurants tend to dumb down their menus for the sake of saving money. And with the crazy rents in NYC these days, who can blame them? However, David Burke Kitchen does a good job showing off their menu, and I can feel confident that I've tasted something that they would have on a normal night.My friends and I decided that we would try to get various dishes so we could try everything. We started with the pretzel-crusted crab cake, lobster dumplings, tuna/salmon tartare, and the baby octopus. My favorite was the baby octopus, since it was so tender and the puree on the side was bomb. The pretzel-crusted crab cake was very good too, although I felt it was a little too hyped up. The tuna and salmon tartare was the perfect texture and the accompanying sauces were great.Entrees were very good, with my favorite being the short rib with cavatelli pasta. The beef was just the right amount of saltiness and tenderness. Branzino was tender and had a very light, not-too-fishy flavor that I really appreciated.Dessert really was the most decadent part of the meal. We got the toffee monkey bread, which was outrageously good. The homemade whipped cream on top really made a difference, as the cream had a really good density to it. The chocolate hazelnut crunch bar was probably my favorite though, since I'm a chocolate junkie. The crispiness/crunchiness of the chocolate bar was perfect and definitely rich. The strawberries and cream tart was actually very tart, which was fine, but I probably couldn't have eaten a whole serving of it.Service was so-so. The rotating waiters were very quick about water, but our main waitress pretty much forgot our entire drink order until we reminded her 20 minutes later. She seemed really out of it, and while I understand it was busy, she seemed to avoid our table after we told her she forgot our drink order. Yikes. However, it wasn't enough to ruin the experience and we had a great time.Overall, I would definitely come back for the normal a la carte dining menu. The portions were definitely good for the price, and I've been told I need to try the cake pop tree, and the dry-aged ribeye. I'll also be back for the upstairs garden seating at the Treehouse bar.",17,0.9919

Great atmosphere for a Midtown hub; it's like walking into a restaurant in the south or in Mexico. I got a Passion Fruit Frozen Margarita since the Blockheads specials were too much for me to handle. It was really good, and pretty strong. Then again, I'm a lightweight and three-quarters of it already had me sweating.We also ordered some food and they were exceptional. The Cheese Quesadillas were totally off the hook and heavenly; the melted cheese was everything. Dip this in sour cream all over, and you'll forget the world. We also had the Nachos Grande which had a bit of everything: guacamole, black beans, melted cheese, and the soft tomatoes were just amazing. Eat this fast because it gets soggy really fast.

I'm sure you've probably been to one of Chef Flay's restaurants before such as Mesa Grill or Bar Americain. Honestly, I wasn't much of a fan of his restaurants, but I changed my mind after visiting Gato! I even went twice within one month which is unusual for me. Chef Flay has created a very impressive, new style of Mediterranean cuisine. On your first visit you must try the tapas listed at the top of their menu. You can choose three tapas for $17. I tried 6 dishes between the two times I visited. I forgot a camera my second time there, so I don't have food photos of everything I ate. My favorite tapas was the Beef Crudo, Lamb Tenderloin, and Piquillo Filled With Raw Tuna. You can see my photos below. I enjoyed the rabbit with couscous so much that I ordered it again on my second visit. This time the dish came with vegetables instead of fava beans. If you read my blog regularly, you know that I'm a huge fan of fava beans! So, I wish it came like that all the time. It was still yummy, though. ;)I love that you can see the kitchen through a glass window because you can watch Chef Flay hard at work. It was wonderful to meet him on my first visit, too! ;) I recommend Gato for any night of the week. I also suggest you go soon while Chef Flay is still cooking everything himself. I believe the first few months after an opening a famous chef will work in the kitchen to make sure operations run well. Don't miss your chance for his personal touch to your meal.

Annnd BONUS ROUND) here's the clincher, if your partner says let's go out and eat after a trying experience at Trader Joe's...you've hit the JACKPOT bc he or she recognizes that yall need a reward/detour from another tense homemade dinner in your cramped apt. while watching Netflix. if your dynamic duo-dom CANNOT survive the TJ stress test , set your iphone countdown timer because it's over--just a matter of time! on the other side of things, if you're trying to break up with someone. constant trips to Trader Joe's with said person will speed up the process. it will hasten the ""it's not you it's me"" convo. for reals. i'm 5/5 with it. ha. i kiiiid or am i? SERIOUSLY THOUGH, a great place to buy organic staples, grassfed proteins, more healthful packaged goods, and less-chemically house goods (cleaners). the prices here are a great bang for your buck obvi. quality of both packaged and fresh foods is great. and the non-hassle Trade Joe's policy makes it way easy to return stuff you don't like or take a non-buyer-beware chance on different foods, goods, etc. lack of choices for different foods is great because it simplifies making purchases--no more sifting through 8 million brands to make a choice. typically there's the house brand (Trader Joes and mebbe one or two others). it proves that Ted Talk about choices and olive oil (look it up), not sure why more retail experience don't follow suit. they'd sell more. aisles at TJs are relatively narrow and can be crowded most times of the day. so park your empty cart and just bring things back to it. no one will mess with it because they are too busy doing their own shopping. OR grab a basket and get a small workout in. Trader Joe's overall is pretty low-fi in appearance and very clean. me likes.i like the lighting in Trader Joe's in general. in most other supermarkets the lighting makes all the food too chrome-y and creepy looking. at TJs, food likes like food, not package design. refreshing.there's always samples of hot or cold food that they are (nicely) shilling at Trader Joe's. it's in the left corner of the store. they have yet to convert me to a purchase, but i have given some of the stuff a long thought about purchase. the staff. awesome. cheerful. energetic. you ask a question and they know the answer or find someone quickly who does. ask for where something is located. they walk you to the item as opposed to giving vague directions like you would to an annoying tourist in nyc. when you're in line, there's always someone stalking the line asking customers whether they need something and that staffer will go off and get it while you park and roll on the endless line. okay the crowds and line. if you go to Trader Joe's on the weekends or primetime (after work) you will get penalized with long lines, crowds, and insipid fellow shopper tantrums. them the breaks. no way to avoid it except to take a deep breath and know that the lines and wait will not be as bad as it appears. so yeah it's my ""steady"" supermarket grocery for the past two years--we exclusive, sorta. still cheat on TJs with Wholefoods because while you can get most staples at TJ's...there are still some things it doesn't service (random items). any(s)way, that will be our secret. ;)p.s.--Trader Joe's delivers if you don't want to carry heavy bags. charges are reasonable",39,0.9585

From the rustic, wooden entryway, adorned with a lions head knocker, to the wallpaper lined interior, it feels far more like a home than a bar.They are supposed to have some traditional Irish tapas at some point, but for now it was just alcohol. They had a whiskey ginger drink that they make sound much more interesting than it is; it tasted like any other whiskey & ginger ale. But at $7, I figured that it was a better deal than their cheapest beer- Coors original for $5. Really?! I know it's the ""Banquet Beer,"" but c'mon...The staff was super nice and attentive.

Setagya's got this shelf that wraps around the restaurant, so it's really conducive to being a loner. You grab a stool and stare out the window or at the wall. Also, the food is legit. It's weird, dine-alone ladies all seem so cool when I see them out and about, but when I myself was trying to approximate their habits, I felt like I was back in the high school cafeteria with my lunch tray, unsure where to eat my jello cup at.I walk in, make eye-contact with the server, and immediately over-pronate on my left foot because I haven't yet mastered the art of walking steadily at key moments, nevermind being cool and demure like a dine-alone lady.

721,9,13,4.0,"Proletariat is probably the best beer bar in the city from a curation standpoint. Lets start with that. Most other beer bars--especially in Manhattan--try to focus on quantity more than anything else. But when you're basically getting the same shit at all of these different places with little variation, who cares? That's why Proletariat selects its 12 draft beers and small list of bottles so carefully, and takes care of them so well. Tucked in a narrow, dark dive bar space on St. Marks, it's all about the quality of the options. I've been in the craft beer scene for several years now, and let me tell you: there's always something worth trying at Proletariat.The bartenders in general are extremely knowledgeable (with one possible exception below) and take very good care of the beer, keeping the tap lines clean and serving beer in the correct glass. One thing that I really like it that they serve full and half glasses of the beers on tap. While you can always ask for a sample anyway, this also enables you to try more of the options they have available. The small space packs out quickly with an array of yuppies, craft beer nerds, and girls who boyfriends hate them and thus dragged them to a beer bar. My advice is to get here early so you can either carve out space at the bar, or grab the lone table in the front. Either way, if you want to enjoy craft beer in NYC it doesn't get much better than this.I can't give them 5 stars because of 1 incident alone. One night , I came with a friend who was new to craft beer, and who wanted something on the lighter side. Rather than ask my opinion, he asked the bartender. Big mistake. For some God-forsaken reason, the bartender recommended Founders Bolt Cutter. As you may be able to tell from the name, that this not a light beer at all; in fact, it is really heavy and strong even for my tastes (15% ABV). I of course found this hilarious and let it happen (yes, I know I am a dick). My friend took 1 sip and started screaming that we were trying to kill him. He ended up finishing it like a man but that set the tone for the night and he's never let me live it down.

There were no tables available, so we decided to wait by the bar until one opened up. I loved how the bar area had cute open window seats facing the mini patio.

But since the burger is such a good sized portion, do you really need to destroy yourself with sides?The service was prompt, friendly and properly attentive. I was seated in the front with the bar and the television screens so I was exposed to a couple of Bros shouting at the Yankees and the Knicks, respectively. But if you're looking to talk to your date, this is a good date spot, there's plenty of seating in the rear. Just ask. I was extremely pleased with my tribute to pork. I just hope that one day I suffer a head injury and wake up loving beer. It's such a waste to go thru life without beer. So much beer.",13,0.9948
725,10,7,4.0,"Let's talk pickles.For someone who doesn't like salty food, I sure as hell love me some pickles. I think part of the allure is just all these fancy pants innovative ideas everybody's been coming up with these days. Cauliflower & curry? Fennel & Grapefruit? Pineapple and Habanero? Yeah I'll bite.As my friend Preeti B put it so nicely, there are some restaurants that serve as a great location for drinks + appetizers (drapps). I like to think of B&W as the place I come to hang with my 8 girlfriends, we get a lot of plates to share, get a couple of drinks and have a good time. A few of my favourite items from the drapps menu include the robiola (with orange honey and pistachios, such a winner that one) and the pickles. While at first look Boulton & Watt seems to lack vegetarian options.. if you're flexible you can really pile up enough items to fill that tummy of yours. The roasted cauliflower with raisins, the quinoa salad, the guac, if everything else fails. I wouldn't call B&W the mixology destination of 2014, but yeah they serve up some decent drinks, if you're in a bit of a creative mood. I liked the first word & the mexican revolver, and generously sipped from others and they were all 3-4 star drinks. If you want to get a little crazy, you can get picklebacks, something I insisted our group should try but no one was feeling adventurous enough!B&W gets pretty crowded and noisy as the hours run by.. but it's a nice spot to hang out, and they open up the large windows in the summer so that's an added bonus. Except can you tell me, why don't they have backrests on the seat? I'm not that young anymore.3.5 stars.",9,0.9884
726,10,4,4.0,"First things first, make a reservation! It took me about 3 weeks to get a reservation for 2 of my girlfriends on a Friday night at 9:00pm, but the wait was well worth it. An unlikely gem near Union Square, you would never expect the Spanish tapas here to be so good! Created by 3-Michelin-star Babbo alums, I expected something delicious and positively impressive. Without fail, I found myself feeling that exact emotion that at the end of my meal.The server suggested that we order about 5 to 6 plates to share among the 3 of us. The sizes of the tapas vary from small on the left side of the menu to larger on the right side of the menu.Bacalao Croquetas: 3 croquetas were served atop an orange aioli. The croquetas are a rendition of salted cod fish sticks that look similar to mozzarella sticks. I didn't think they were amazing, but not bad either.Scallops with Chilled Celery Broth and Miso Bloody Mary Salsa: This dish could've been butchered horribly or perform leaps and bounds above my expectations. I'm wary about ordering scallops after having a few underwhelming experiences, but this dish certainly blew me away. The scallops were laid in a delicious broth and my knife cut through them without any resistance at all. The salsa was the perfect combination with the delicious scallops. I found myself reluctantly letting go of this dish because of how well the salsa and broth paired with the complementary bread.Razor Clams a la Plancha: 3 layers of razor clams laid flat and drizzled in a generous concoction of oily garlic and parsley. This is a MUST. The razor clams were tender and flavorful. This plate was definitely a highlight of the meal and one of my favorite dishes here. Again, use the complementary bread to soak up these juices for a perfect side.Skirt Steak with Romesco and Onion Mermelada: This was my favorite dish of the night. The flavors were explosive and the rare steak was so tender and juicy. The sweetness of the onion mermelada atop the steak accompanied the savory flavors of the protein well. Black Sea Bass: I didn't get a chance to try much of this as this was the only dish my friend could eat given that she had to take her wisdom teeth out. The gazpacho the sea bass sat in was really flavorful and I got to steal a few of the cucumbers pieces, which were perfectly pickled. She had only positive things to say about the black sea bass.Arroz con Leche: I'm not a huge fan of rice pudding, but this was addictively tasty. And, I can never say no to gelato, which sat atop the rice pudding. Steer clear of the lemon peels though, they're super bitter! (Unless that's your thing, then by all means, beeline for it)I have yet to try so many other items on the menu that I'll definitely have to return for a second round. Hopefully, I'll be able to get a seat at a table near the windows where it's less cramped and there's less moving traffic around me.",12,0.9989
727,6,18,4.0,"Given this thread is overrun with tourists it felt like some accuracy was in order. If you came there for the HIMYM experience, sure they will be trying to keep things in order because tourists (that includes you Jersey, Long Island and Connecticut) have made it a Monday night spot. On Mondays the place ranges from warm crowd to a little bit full. Tourists will complain for anything that isn't Disneyland full of lights and dancing bears. McGee's is your typical Midtown bordering on HK kinda after work Irish joint. Food is decent, highly recommend the Jerk chicken wrap or rosemary chicken, and the prices are cheap esp at happy hour. For those non-tourists who come nights OTHER THAN MONDAY/HIMYM you will discover a chill spot that is mostly an afterwork crowd. The staff is friendly as can be, affordable options, clean, sizable venue, decent screens to watch games... All standard fare for a midtown spot that thankfully does NOT draw the Times Square crowd, though it gets the HIMYM tourists. You can always tell who the out-of-towners are even on off nights. Just walk around them, don't get too deep into conversation, and let them think they know where the ""cool"" spots are in town so they don't end up in our fave haunts. The HIMYM tie-in is mostly a boon for the business but somewhat of a curse when you see the 2-star rating. Some of the complaints in this thread lead me to wonder if these folks have been to a big city before let alone do they know how to order a drink and how it is served (yes, people often drink cider on ice, that's why they offer the option, how did you end up with a $9 Guinness? Do you know what a shepherd's pie tastes like? Lol)",12,0.2598

Obviously tips are encouraged, but this amenity is a huge plus. Their prices are pretty average, $7-$10 per drink, depending on what you get.

730,23,20,4.0,"Where's Herbie?There are many things that distract me when I am waiting in line for food: what to order when it's my turn to be served, the thoughtless guy smoking too close to those waiting, the backless top of the pretty girl standing in front causing, er, enhanced blood flow, the number of people behind me in line (we all need continued re-assurance that there are people worse off than us), etc. but nothing tickles my fancy more than figuring out where is the bottleneck, or Herbie (from the eminently readable book: The Goal, on a topic best left to be pondered on dark, stormy nights: the Theory of Constraints).In Morgenstern's case, it appears to be the sweet lady standing next to the cash register, smiling graciously, answering questions, and allowing you to sample the odd flavor before making up your mind.... But, it probably is not... I suspect there are fewer flavors sampled per customer at Morgenstern's than at other popular ice cream shops - and it's not simply because you can't see the different flavors. Instead, it appears to me that their real constraint is the number of servers, and if not for more servers, it would still be better if all 3 were scooping ice cream.The first time I visited Morgenstern's and waited in line, I debated whether the 3.5 star rating could be attributed to good grammar Nazis punishing them for the use of the word ""Finest"", suggesting that there were other clients suffering from the injustice of receiving worse ice cream than at this location. There seemed to be no reason for the rating as I found the Cardamom Lemon Jam and Salted Caramel Pretzel both delightful... In my next visit, I debated whether the logical people took offense to the categorization of flavors on the menu: Vanilla(s), Chocolate(s), Coffee(s), Caramel(s), and Specials... I visualized them gasping and shaking their fists: How could Chocolate/Salted Caramel not be Special?But, I realize that the problem with the otherwise excellent Morgenstern's is the tendency to swing for the fences, a trait explained by the owner's philosophy of ""flavor profiles"" - the ultimate judgment of which lies in execution. To me, a flavor like Salt and Pepper Pine Nut might end up tasting delightful, but there are others like Sesame Caramel and PB Picosos that don't really stand out. Similarly while the overall impression of the Green Tea Pistachio was really good, I still felt somewhat misled by the server saying it's really green tea with pistachios sprinkled on it - for the pistachio flavor completely overpowered the green tea in the version I ate, and it wasn't really a pairing.At the end of the day, with a ""I'm a fan"" rating, my gripe might well be a pedantic attempt at distinction without any real difference - but I choose to think of it as comparative reviewing for I can't ignore other superlative ice creams I've had across the country in taking issue with them. Nevertheless, Morgenstern's is undoubtedly amongst the finest ice creams in New York City, ably delivering on quality at ""relatively low"" sugar and butterfat. So, I hate to end the review by noting that they make me appreciate Ample Hills Creamery even more: At Ample Hills I stood behind 62 people and was served in 30 minutes - at Morgenstern's I was # 33 and it took me 40 minutes instead. My advice to them is: Figure it out. There are ice cream wars brewing in the city - and only the fittest will survive.",26,0.9258
731,10,7,4.0,"Perfect little cocktail bar in Financial District. I stopped by on a Saturday evening after dinner in Chinatown. I'm so glad I finally got to visit this infamous place. Aside from the cocktails, I really enjoyed the vibe here. The lights are dimly lit and soul music in background. Definitely a classy bar that would be perfect for a first date. The only thing is I wish they had was more available seating but if you don't mind standing I guess it's ok. We were lucky to find two empty stools by the back of the bar. I would recommend this place for a first date, catching up with an old friend or even a business meeting. The crowd was mostly people in their late 20s, 30s and above. Therefore no worries about rowdy college kids. Cocktails range from $12-$14. I had the ""Frisco"" which was a Bourbon cocktail. It was potent and the flavors worked well together. My boyfriend had the ""McGlashan"" which was a whiskey cocktail containing Jameson, ginger liquor, honey syrup, lemon and few other ingredients. His was sweeter than mine but still excellent.Really enjoyed my visit and will definitely be coming back. Perfect addition to the neighborhood!",10,0.9876
732,13,6,4.0,"I know some people are like, ""Meh, Asian Fusion"", but I am not one of those people.

I wouldn't say I am a Dim sum expert, but I know what I like.Anyway, I came here the other night with a small group. The place boasts communal sitting, which I like, and makes it easy for groups. I can see how this would be annoying if you were trying to have a 1:1 romantic date.I am not a pork eater (at least not knowingly) so I steered clear of any pork themed dumplings. The Pac Man shrimp dumplings were awesome (and cute, though that isn't something I usually rate food on). The crunchy vegetable & peanut dumplings were tasty, the spicy crispy beef was memorable and the steamed lobster dumplings were also pretty great. No one in my group ordered an entree, so I can not comment on that. Ambiance is cool/hip/trendy, service was average, and food was above average. We came on a weekday night at around 6:30pm. No wait.

733,10,6,4.0,"This is my 1,000th review (!!!), and I'm so happy that I'm writing it about a new fantastic restaurant in my beloved Upstate Manhattan: Burger Heights.A few weeks ago while walking to the 1 Train, the signage above the entrance caught my eye, and my interest was piqued. This location, between 181st and 182nd on Wadsworth, seemed a bit off of the beaten path. I was unsure of when it was going to open, but a slew of Yelp reviews popping up on my main Yelp page yesterday seemed to show that, indeed, business was up and running!I convinced the beau to meet me up there for dinner. (Though, honestly, I didn't have to twist his arm too hard.) Right away, I was pleased with the vibe it put out: It has that garage door open-style, with two wooden counters free and exposed to Wadsworth. We perused the computerized menu above the cash register to decide upon our burger choices. The menu is small, but we both agreed that's a good thing; akin to a Shake Shack, you've got a few choices to select from with the option to double up on meat patties. I liked that. While there were plain options and two kinds of veggie burger options, I decided to be a bit bolder and go for The Amsterdam: A Pat LaFrieda meat patty with guacamole, tomato, and queso fresca. The beau opted for the Heights Burger with a double patty. THESE. BURGERS. ARE. AMAZING. The meat on both burgers, which we asked for medium rare, almost literally melted in our mouths. The buns were pillowy soft. The gauc on The Amsterdam was perfect and not so overwhelming in which it weighed down the burger or the bun. The special sauce on the Heights Burger had a good flavor with a slight hint of mustard. The lettuce on the Heights Burger, though a little large, was incredibly green and crisp, as if it was just picked from a garden five minutes prior. Also on the docket were a chocolate gelato milkshake and an order of fries, both of which were fantastic. The fries were clearly housemade, and the milkshake had a deep chocolate flavor to it.And can we talk PRICES? I find it funny that, as a New Yorker, I automatically assume that any good hamburger will cost me at least $12. As much as I don't like to admit this, I was honestly shocked, though pleasantly, when I saw the prices of burgers at this place. The most expensive hamburger was about $6.50, and that was The Amsterdam. The basic burger was less than $4. This place is Shake Shack-esque, but leaps and bounds above it. The food quality is fantastic, the space is cute, and the service is friendly, though there are still a few kinks to work out in the order taking process. (Our cashier was nice, but it took her a while to get our order down pat. No matter! I have faith. Haha.) I am so glad this place is in my neighborhood and I hope that it thrives! I know I'll be returning many MANY times.",28,0.9986

With the sign they give you if you filp the sign green they will keep coming to you and offer you any type of meat you like and if the sign is red then the waiters know that your full or you need to take some time for round 2-definitely worth going to dine in with a group or with family. - the waiters are very funny and engaging to make you laugh at some point-if you happen to go in a group please reserve at least a day in advance please it does get crowded and you will have to wait an hour at least before your group name is called.-they have a complete salad bar with tons of sushi,veggies, and riceConsThey don't tell you that it takes a few minds getting the waiters to you and will tell you to use the salad bar until the waiters come around with the meat.

735,16,6,4.0,"David Chang's Momofuku Milk Bar impresses with a lineup of desserts, a multitude of sweet, buttery, salty/sweet treats that arouse curiosity. With names like Crack Pie, Oatmeal Creme Pie Soft Serve and Compost Cookie, it's hard not to wonder. There are a few locations, and I've managed to sample Momofuku Milk Bar at Madison Square Eats when open, however, the selection can be limited. The East Village location itself is a primetime spot. As for the space, it's actually quite small, without seating, and severe limitations to decor. Going back on their desserts though, this is where their praise is well deserved. For a not so sweet tooth person, The Crack Pie, while ultra sweet, is perhaps one of the most impressive desserts I've encountered. It's super chewy with each bite. Sugar coated with 'crack' to the right amount. This isn't any typical pie, and it's one to have if at the Milk Bar. The Cereal Milk beverage and Cereal Milk Soft-Serve is going to be an instant favorite for those who look forward to slurping the milk leftover from their cereal. That is exactly a way to describe the flavor. I thoroughly enjoyed their Cereal Milk Soft-Serve, and one should have it with the sugared cornflakes. The cornflakes add a nice texture, and the taste has a notable saltiness that contrasts yet complements the cereal milk nicely.If you want something sweet, but also different, experimental in taste and preparation, Momofuku Milk Bar has plenty to offer in that regard.

And yes, I admitted that I was wrong after I tried FLAT WHITE at this place. Some people say this coffee is over-priced, but I think it's definitely worth it. And also worth waiting on a long line in the afternoon! It's not latte or cappuccino - it's flat white. People say that flat white is Australian version of latte, but technically it's different from latte or cappuccino in terms of how milk is used when making coffee. Cappuccino has stiff foam of milk on top of espresso, so that you taste milk bubble first when drinking. Latte is made of liquid milk blended with espresso, so it tastes just like milky coffee. Flat white has even mix of both liquid and velvety foam of milk with espresso on the bottom of a cup. (I did some research because I was so curious how flat white tastes different from the other two)Indeed, one of the best quality coffees in the midtown.

Last night I had the duck breast (I wanted the Arctic char, which my boyfriend has had before that he really enjoyed, but they were out) and my bf had the pork chop. We also ordered a seasonal vegetable plate and two glasses of a biodynamic Sauvignon blanc. The vegetables were delightful - perfectly cooked brussel sprouts, sweet pickles, a cubed beet salad, paper thin radish slices, and a (sweet potato? pumpkin?) purée with baguette toast. Yum, I could have just eaten a few helpings of that!My duck breast was gorgeous. I almost never eat duck, so this was a treat. It was tender and juicy. I loved the celery purée and crispy leeks as sides! My boyfriend's pork chop was massive and also delicious and beautiful. His cheddar grits eclipsed my celery purée - I'm from the south, and those were the best grits I've ever eaten. Ever. I have to mention the wine. As I said before, it was biodynamic. In the glass, it looked like it had a tiny bit of fermentation, almost like a beer. It was delicious! I want to buy a bottle of it. For dessert, we shared a chocolate pudding.

746,8,8,4.0,"I like Shorty's. Located just outside Times Square, Shorty's is my go-to when I'm (admittedly rarely) looking for a drink/sustenance in that area. Their once amazing happy hour special of a $9 draft beer/sandwich combo is now 33% more expensive, but still a decent deal at $12. Also, I think they charged me an extra dollar for the Stella I chose to accompany my cheesesteak, which I felt like was dishonest. There were no qualifiers about what type of beer you could get on the menu, and no warning from the bartender, just a $1 surcharge on the tab. Boo. But anyway, the sandwiches are tasty. I prefer the broccoli rabe roast pork with provolone and dipping juices, but the cheesesteak is also quite tasty and filling. They both come on good bread and are generously stuffed, juicy gut-bombs. They have really nice crispy fries too. They have that kind of rough outer surface that I really like in a fry--I think it works because it adds surface area and makes it extra crispy. We got the old bay seasoning, which was a nice touch. Aside from the beer up-charge, the only problem I've ever had here is that once Boyfriend and I came in intending to get something to eat, but there was nowhere to sit. We decided to regroup and come up with a plan B, but I also needed to use the bathroom, so I did that before we left. On the way back we were accosted by the waitress who told us we couldn't just use the bathroom and leave. We explained that we had only done so since there was no where to sit, but she continued to give us a hard time, claiming that they could squeeze us in somewhere or something. Totally unnecessary call-out; I used your toilet; get over it--we're leaving. But that awkwardness aside, the food is good, the beer is reasonably priced and it's overall a step above your average sports bar. Added bonus: fun 90s rock music was playing on my last visit.

You have to go to the back and up the stairs to get to the bar. The chandelier hangs from a large skylight that lets in sunlight and gives the whole room a very bright, natural glow. They play soothing yet upbeat modern folk music that matches well with the woody, spacious interior. Currently only the soft open menu is available and is a little lacking, but I expect good things soon. My first drink was the Rosario stick up which is tequila, rosemary thyme syrup, gran marnier, lemon, egg white, and rose petal . Very light, yummy, not too sweet and very strong. My second drink I just asked for a second tequila based cocktail and got a tequila Collins. A little to simple for my taste to be honest, so I'd give the second drink a three out of five. My qualms with this place is that it used to be a divey sports bar and all the guys would come up and get burgers, so even on the opening day when it is revamped into a classier place, you are getting a lot of loud raucous kids lumbering up from the five guys downstairs. Anyway the bartenders are nice, trying hard to make good cocktails, and for their soft opening they gave a great showing.

They only ask you how you want your steak cooked and that's it. First, they bring out the walnut salad which was really good, then comes the steak & fries. The sauce was really unique & savory. Not what a typical American would pour over meat. They do not have ketchup for the fries here so don't even think about asking for it or they will give you dirty looks! When I did ask for ketchup, they told me they could bring me more steak sauce for an extra $1.50 which wasn't bad I suppose. I just couldn't handle eating fries with nothing on them. Great sauce I will reiterate! Especially since I was willing to pour it all over my fries. I'm curious to try this spot in Paris one day since everyone on yelp keeps comparing this place to the o.g location.

We walked in and the perfect amount of people were inside: not too crowded, but just enough to make it seem like it was a place people wanted to be. I also appreciated the diversity: people young and old were enjoying themselves and the place had a refreshing lack of pretension. We sat at the bar while and awesome Latin played on stage in the back. I ordered a margarita, and even though it came out of a machine, it was SLAMMIN'. My friend ordered the chocolate souffle which we shared, which was also SLAMMIN'. So rich and decadent, and it came with cream to pour on top of it, which made it even more over the top.

But if they're good friends, they'll know that I'm at Veselka, waiting for them with a ton of varenyky/pierogi. And occasionally some stuffed cabbages and matzo ball soup.Veselka has been my drunk food (and comfort food) spot since.... ages ago really. It's the only place that I like that's open 24/7 - and the only place that I can get a ton of food for under $20 at 3 AM. I've gone to Veselka post-girls nights out; for catch up with friends; and just to fill up my empty stomach. I love how huge the portions are - one stuffed cabbage is enough for two people. And a bowl of soup is absolutely huge - go for a cup if you're planning on having varenyky/pierogi.My favorite things here include:- The varenyky/pierogi. I always try to get their specials, and I prefer most of them fried rather than boiled. Super delicious every time, no matter what the filling is.- The vegetarian plate. You get a meatless stuffed cabbage AND 4 pierogi for $14. I mean, really - you can't beat that deal. Now, I love meat as much as the next person (actually, maybe a little less than the next person), but the meatless stuffed cabbag is absolutely delicious. There have been times where I'll wake up from a dream where I'm having their meatless stuffed cabbage, and I'll actually walk over at 4/5 AM to order it.** Plus, by ordering the vegetarian plate, you can totally feel like you're being healthy even if the portion is huge. (And this is how I justify it not being a cheat day. Even though it totally constitutes as one.)- Potato Pancakes. Absolute potato goodness. What else can I say about them?- Ukrainian Meat Borscht Soup. I just love this soup so much, I have to keep my tears of happiness from falling every time I get it. (Note: if you don't like beets, don't get borscht. I had a friend who hated beets and got this because I kept raving about it - just because I loved it doesn't mean you will. Especially since I'm kind of addicted to beets.)- Matzo Ball Soup. I love matzo ball soup - and their's is pretty fantastic. With huge delicious matzo balls.The next thing I want to try when coming here - the breakfast/brunch menu. Maybe that'll be my summer 2014 food goal...*I don't actually disappear - I always text at least one person. Or tell them that I'll meet them at Veselka. And then I'll check in on Yelp.

The cupcakes are tiny, like Baked by Melissa's, so I ordered 3 for $5 to try -- Pretzels and Beer, For the Love of Bacon and the Old-Fashioned. These boozy little treats were so delicious! They were all incredibly moist, not too sweet and all the elements for each cupcake worked so well together! My favorite was the Pretzels and Beer -- combination of the salty crunchy pretzel with the fluffy frosting and airy cake was perfect! I really enjoyed the other two as well, though.

It is, after all, across the street from the flagship Bloomingdales and within tooting distance of all of the high-end shops on Madison Avenue. Which is why I like it, especially as an after work or post-Central Park option. In downtown Manhattan - specifically the East Village - the dives try to be dives.

Subway Inn wins this contest in its neighborhood HANDS DOWN- but not because it gives a damn.

759,15,14,4.0,"Summary:A swell place for a fancy drink. Mood lighting. Sometimes, live jazz.Details:$13-14 cocktails, with a menu split between standards and house specialties that lean on Japanese-y ingredients like toasted green tea and yuzu. I tried four and they were all good, if a little heavy on the sweetness. For one of my orders I asked for a bartender's choice, with my one request that it be painfully gingery. I got what they called ""essentially a daiquiri"", with rum, ginger-syrup, and yuzu. It was was too light on the ginger but otherwise delicious.For food, the menu has small and full plates. We tired a few of the small ones:- mac & cheese: thumbs up- smoked tuna sashimi: nicely savory- fried chicken ""tatsuta"": well crisped- octopus w/ potato: not at all gummyIt was all pretty good. It's not like restaurant food you'd go out of your way to have, but if you're here and hungry, or if you're looking for a cocktail place that also has food, they've got good stuff.Service is fine if not especially warm, nor was it forthcoming with the sort of detailed ebullience you get at certain fancy cocktail places where they divulge every drink ingredient as if it were picked and muddled just for you by a forest witch composing magical elixirs.Live jazz plays some weeknights--I came here on a Wed evening and it started around 8pm. It's a bit too loud for the space so if you're coming here for close conversation, you'll want to sit away from the bar. The music was organ-heavy and very ""jazzy"".

760,6,0,4.0,"After reading rave reviews of the performance in NY Mag and on podcasts, my friends and I decided to check this piece of immersive theater out together. This was a very unique performance and I'm glad we went!Here are some tips:- pricing is dramatically different depending on day and time you go. Mon - Wed: $80Thurs: $90Fri & Sun: $100Sat: $110- You reserve tickets to go in at 15 minute intervals. The performances inside are ongoing and finish up at 10:30pm (at least, on Wednesdays). You can stay as long as you'd like (until closing).- If you purchase your tickets online, there's a $6/ticket surcharge. You can also pre-purchase tickets AT the McKittrick hotel, but they're only open in the evening during the performances, or you can buy tickets at the Heath (the affiliated restaurant) during their open hours (also in the evenings).- you MUST check your coat and bag for $4 per person. We gamed the system by stuffing our purses and jackets into hubby's backpack so we could all share one coat/bag check, haha. It's also really warm inside the theater so wear a light t-shirt.- There is nudity! Be aware if you're squeamish or are planning on getting tickets for your parents as a gift.SPOILER ALERT (stop reading if you want to be completely surprised).I'm not a big fan of surprises so I did really extensive research of other yelp reviews. Here's a breakdown of all the information I found helpful.- The performance is based on Shakespeare's ""Macbeth."" Read over the story on Wikipedia before you head out and I think you'll enjoy the performances more. I read the synopsis beforehand and I don't think it took anything away from the evening at all. It's not a straight up re-telling of Macbeth so there's lots to see.- They will attempt to split you up from whomever you went to the performance with. When you check in you each get a different playing card. Then they call different cards to enter the performance. - After you receive your playing card, you go through a long, pitch black walkway/stairs to a lounge with live music. Don't buy anything to drink because they'll quickly call you into the performance and you can't bring your $14 cocktail inside.- There are 5 floors. After everyone with your playing card is called, you receive identical masks. Don't freak out about it being dirty - they don't re-use them. You get to keep it afterwards as a souvenir. Then you pile into a creepy elevator and go to the top floor. They let out ONE person. If you are easily scared, make sure this is not you. Then they let out about half of the elevator on floor 4, and the rest on floor 3. I have no idea what was on floor six because people in black masks won't let you up.- Since the performances are ongoing throughout 5 floors, wear some comfortable shoes because you walk a lot. There are also a lot of chairs (also beds) so you can also rest, haha. - With the title ""Sleep No More,"" I was worried this would be like a haunted house. It's not. No one is out to scare you. I thought I wouldn't want to split up from hubby but once I was inside I realized it'd be a lot more fun to be able to go off and explore what intrigued me, rather than sticking with him the whole night.- Each performance lasts 1 hour, beginning on the half hour (7:30, 8:30, 9:30, etc). This is key because you know at the beginning of each performance to go to one of the top floors because the characters start out there and slowly make their way down to the first floor for the last scene (a really cool feast that happens at 20 min past and lasts about 10 minutes).- People recommend that you follow one character. You can do this, but I didn't because I got kind of bored with some of them. I think it's better to spend your time in different sections of the hotel.- Try to be around when Macbeth murders Duncan (underneath the tented bed). It's intense. - Even more intense: the 3 witches in some sort of bloody orgy. It occurs at about 10 after the hour on one of the upper floors. It's a big scene so the black masked folks will try to usher you into the (slightly hidden) room. - Have fun! Go out afterwards with your friends and piece together what everyone saw!",28,0.9902

Then, it's over all too soon and you're asking god/the waiter: why??The sushi/sashimi that I grew up on was nothing like that of Sushi Yasuda. The sushi that I grew up on was that of the sort doled about by the standard ""Chicken Teriyaki and Tempura Serving"" Chinese-run establishments. Salmon, Tuna, and Yellow Tail are always cheap and plentiful. Quality is hit or miss, but hey, my Sashimi Combo came with chicken teriyaki, miso soup, a side salad, and 6 california rolls. Who cares right? WRONG!Let me tell you why. Here's what we ordered.Omakase. Just do it. Usually I don't do Omakase since I'm afraid I might not get the fish that I like or the chef might rip us off, but in this instance I trusted my waiter and his permed hair. The Omakase came with the following:4 types of Salmon: All fish are not created equal. My favorite was the King Salmon. Very regal tasting. Not fishy at all. Perfect balance of fattiness.Uni: One of my top 10 favorite foods. Hands down the best Uni I've ever had anywhere. If I ever win the lottery, I'm going to bring a gold bucket to Sushi Yasuda and tell them to fill it with their Uni. Oysters: Mehh. Just go to a bar for these. It was a bit weird eating these on sushi riceClam: I could go ham on some clam.Yellowtail: To be honest, I was never the biggest fan of yellow tail but it always seems to be the people's champ in terms of sashimi. It was good, but like I said, not my personal favorite.Tuna: Didn't even taste the high mercury content. Tasted like a super-rare steak. 2 types of Eel: After I finished all the Uni in my lottery winning gold bucket, I would proceed to request that they fill said bucket with their eel. I would then ask them to look away as I gorged myself.Ginger: The only food that I have a distaste for is ginger. Suffice to say, I didn't care much for it. However, my girlfriend said that it was amazing and they gave a huge pile of it. I guess it's a plus for all you freaks who like ginger. While it was a great experience, I took off a star because I walked away from this meal empty in both wallet and stomach. I know the whole idea of places like this are to enjoy every morsel of food, but man I was starving that night. It was one of those moments where you heard the voice of what your parents would say in your head: ""What a rip-off, I'm not even full"". Business for the Mcdonalds nearby must be great!",18,0.9981
763,7,7,4.0,"What impresses me most about this sushi institution isn't the sushi nor is it the sake. It's the abundant fountain of patience that the staff has every time I've been there when tables upon tables of drunken young adults are slamming down (literally) sake bombs on sake bombs; sometimes, I actually think they enjoy all the chaos of screaming and spilled sake/beer while I would be close to murder if someone had asked me twenty times for chopsticks and napkins.If you haven't figured it out yet, All you can eat and All you can drink (AYCE/AYCD) is the name of the game here and while the experience of it all is quite memorable (or not..) , the rolls are actually pretty good. You're not going to get the freshest of fish for obvious reasons but their rolls are no pushovers either, even if you decide to order 4-5 of them. Here are some of my favorites:1) Sexy Roll: A favorite among our friend group with shrimp tempura and spicy tuna with white tuna on top. Maybe it's because of the name . . . it's probably because of the name. There's obviously something very exciting about looking down the menu and seeing a ""Sexy"" roll...only when you're drunk though. But seriously, it's pretty good.2) Spider Roll: I'm just a huge fan of spider rolls and Kumo has a deeecent one, not the best but after several sake bombs it won't really matter. 3) Yammy Roll: This one has some asparagus and whitefish I think and is served with some special mayonnaise sauce. I'm not the biggest fan of mayonnaise but there is something refreshing about this roll. 4) Amaebi Roll: This is probably my new favorite. It has this sweet shrimp that complements the crab and avocado perfectly. It goes down really easily and is surprisingly light but satisfying with really good flavor, which is important when you have a lake of beer and sake in your stomach. Overall, I haven't really had any bad rolls here. They aren't top quality and you won't be having an umami orgasm in your seat after each bite but for what they are and considering it's AYCE/AYCD, the sushi is pretty good. If you're looking for a fun place to come with a group of friends to start a night out, Kumo is definitely the place to consider. And like I said before, the staff is really chill and understanding. In all honesty, I'm sure they care when you spill beer all over the floor or drop your chopsticks for the 66th time in a night but the fact that I haven't seen them take off a head is a miracle. All in all, if you're safe, respectful, and you don't try and order 8 rolls at once, it's hard to not have a good time at Kumo.",9,0.9987

765,7,5,4.0,"Momokawa is like a hidden gem within Kips Bay. It's a tiny restaurant that is modest, but the food and quality of their meats is out of this world. Before you make your way here, make sure to make a reservation on OpenTable because this place is small, and the seats do tend to fill up relatively quickly. After doing so, you'll make you way inside through their ground floor, up the stairs, and be welcomed into a pretty intimate dinner setting.I've dined at Momokawa twice and both times, I've had great experiences. The first time, I decided to opt for the shabu shabu with my party. With sukiyaki and shabu shabu, there needs to be a minimum party of two to order, which makes sense considering the amount of food that you get. In regards to the quality of the meat, it is definitely on point. There is a nice marble to the beef, and each person gets a healthy portion of roughly 5 large pieces. On the side, you do get a bowl of assorted vegetables and a bowl of rice. The only downside is that if you're coming here with a group of guys, then you might not have enough food, depending on everyone's appetite. On my second visit, I decided to opt for the sukiyaki. For starters, we ordered the fried tofu and the pork belly. The pork belly came in a sweet broth with two pretty sizable pieces. The pork was cooked fairly well, with the pork falling apart against your chopsticks. However, it did come out a little on the cold side which made it a little saddening to eat. The fried tofu came with three pieces of tofu, also topped off with some broth. This was pretty good, but it also was just standard to the agedashi tofu that you'd get anywhere else. As far as the sukiyaki goes, it was pretty solid. Our server helped set us up by cooking the first batch, and left us to go at our own pace. My only tip is to make sure that you do have enough broth on the pan or else your food will be charred and end up on the salty side. That aside, the amount of food is more than enough for a party of two, especially if you're dining as a couple.Momokawa has great service, an intimate atmosphere, and very legitimate Japanese food. Price-wise, you can get away with spending under $100 for a party of two, even with appetizers and drinks which is pretty amazing.

This is one time I didn't mind my clothes smelling like the food!  My friends and I ate here and we loved everything.  It seems like it's always crowded but tables turn okay so sit at the bar, have a few drinks and wait. It's worth it.We naturally got the bacon flight and all flavors were delicious, but I liked the jalapeno best. Maple was a close second. Two friends had the grilled cheese, which they devoured with smiles. I had the Caesar salad which was probably the best I've ever had. I absolutely loved it.  Another friend went straight to dessert and got three slabs of bacon dipped in chocolate with a side of ice cream. Yeah, there's nothing awful about that folks! Not only was the food great, our server Lindsay was beyond amazing. Her enthusiasm was only eclipsed by her knowledge of the menu. Try to get her section if you go, because she is a delight.On the negative side, beers are outrageously expensive, in my opinion.

When I go to Johnny's I always get the soft shell crabs and for $11.00 it's a bargain. You get 3-4 crabs and a ton of fries and the obligatory small serving of cole slaw. When it comes to the soft shells I always forget to split my order with whoever I'm with, 'cause I conveniently neglect remembering how much food they give you and by almost the end of my meal I'm asking, 'why didn't I share?' So I end up sharing the remaining sum with the seagulls...it's a tradition that most people do with their leftovers. The seagulls seem to enjoy it...hope I'm not contributing to hurting them. Anyways, I digress. In case there are non-seafood lovers in your group aside from my soft shells, there's a variety of other seafoods plus burgers and ribs and stuff to be ordered. The bottom line is, after you've made your pilgrimage out to CI and checked all the other restaurants, come check out Johnny's it's one of those Bronx institutions that must be visited at least once.

As I'm drooling thinking about my delish meal, all I can say is that it's hard to find another joint in the city that serves a similar sandwich that has the perfect mix of tender meat and crispy batter. Combined with the refreshing slaw, it's one perfect sandwich for all your cravings. The fries here were pretty good. Not very salty but served hot and crispy.I also added a cucumber salad for the heck of it. It was refreshing, but I'm not sure it was worth the four dollar price tag. The chicken sandwich however, was worth every nickle of the 10 bucks they charged. Next time if I'm hungry enough, I'll order two of them.I also wanted to try their shakes but they apparently ran out by the end of the day.At least it gives me another reason to go back.",19,0.7457
770,17,12,4.0,"100 Montaditos is truly a little neighborhood gem--especially on Wednesday night, when they offer $5 plates of selected sandwiches (meat, veggie, Mediterranean, chocolate, or ""black label""). I made the mistake of being greedy and ordering 3 such plates (each one has 5 sandwiches), thinking that they are bite-sized. Well, I definitely had 2 days' worth of lunch from the leftovers. The lesson is: don't be greedy.There's a lovely garden in the back that was blissfully laid-back before 6 pm and quickly filled up after 6:30. There's also plenty of expected Spanish-themed drinks like Sangria, some beers, and Albarino at about $5/glass (not happy hour prices, this comes standard). This place is seriously affordable, even with the regular menu prices (three of those sandwiches will fill you up unless you're famished).There are a few small detractors: (1) The cheap tabs have NYU-dents and other Millennials flocking, but that's the target demo.(2) The business model prizes the churning of hundreds of Montaditos to its hungry audience over all else and allocates staff accordingly. You seat yourself and wait until they bring your plate (there's no tracking system with numbers/receipts; they just find you somehow). This can result in order confusion and made it a little awkward in leaving the tip (there's a jar by the register that the staff shares, I guess). Our table was taken over by someone almost the second we got up, so they have plenty of customers. I see this place sticking around.",20,0.5998

I have walked by this place a few times (I work down the street) and today, I decided to try it. This place has a modern/fun decor, really nice employees, and was fairly crowded for a 3pm juice run- All key components I look for in my juicing experience.The menu is pretty standard (bubble teas, juices, healthy themed snacks, etc). In case you were interested, I went with the Whole Green Juice (cucumber, kale, spinach, apple, romaine, lemon, parsley and celery). It was good, and cold, which is important to me. Some other juice places serve the juice at room temperature. Cold juice really enhances the drinking experience.And, and, the container the juice was served in was very cool. It is sealed with a plastic cover that you can poke a straw through. The cover also includes the warning, ""avoid choking while drinking"". That is something I can get behind.",15,0.9402

Now, it could just mean that these desserts are eaten in a flash because of the ease with which they can be eaten, but I'll just say the éclairs here were devoured very, very quickly probably more for their positive effects on the taste buds than anything else! The bakery is surprisingly large with a lot of walking space as there are only four tables for pairs on one side, and bar seating for six on the other side. I think it'd be a great place to grab a tea and croissant* for a quick pick-me-up in the mornings. The bakery is very quiet in the evenings, but that doesn't mean that there isn't an abundance of still-fresh baked goods left.The éclairs ($4.10 (why the extra ten cents?)) are pricey, but good. Strawberry: The éclair shell is delicate, not soggy, and crisp with a light dusting of powdered sugar. Slices of strawberry are plentiful, but the custard cream sandwiched between the two shells is not; it's a very fresh, light dessert that may not be sweet enough for most.Praline: Our favorite! Bits of crushed hazelnuts and a praline icing dot the top, and a really smooth praline cream fills the inside. The praline cream is very delightful and is ten times better than a Ferrero Rocher. Caramel: The caramel cream filling isn't too sweet, but the crispy sheet of hardened caramel on top is very sweet. This one isn't my favorite, but the texture is nice.Milk chocolate: This one is definitely the cutest - it has a chocolate cream filling, a thin layer of chocolate icing, and mini chocolate puffs scattered on top. The chocolate filling, though, could be a bit creamier.Likelihood of another visit:Very likely! *Everyone else has been raving about their croissants, so I'm curious!

Shrimp toast: pretty standard; good but not outstanding.Egg drop soup: again, pretty standard, but tastes fresh and natural.Baby shrimp fried rice: I think the baby shrimp taste much better than large jumbo shrimp, even though the latter look nicer.

However, this Indian establishment is unlike the others in Midtown in that it is super clean, modern, and not yet ridiculously crowded. You're able to have a nice, un-rushed lunch here with plenty of natural lighting.Opt for the lunch combo and it runs you $8.26 for 2 main dishes and a choice of brown/basmati rice and naan. Add $1 for lamb choices. This means you can go all veggie, meat + veggie, or meat + meat. I don't think food is cooked to order - it comes out pretty fast.I went for the lamb vindaloo and mashed eggplant (forgot what the actual name was). The lamb was tender and not too gamey, but the sauce could have had a bit more kick to it for being ""vindaloo"". It had the typical dark red sauce. The mashed eggplant (with garlic, tomatoes, and other yum ingredients) was amazing. It was slightly tangy, not too mushy, and all the flavors came together very well. I would definitely recommend this vegetarian side. The naan was not special. It tasted like pita bread and didn't give me the ""ahh"" satisfaction that good naan usually gives. Basmati rice was a little on the firm side. If it weren't for the mediocre naan, firm rice, and mildness of the vindaloo, this place would have deserved 5 stars from my first visit.Overall, best choice for Indian food in Midtown.

Some clues and keys are more obvious and easily found than others. The rest are clever enough to spark collective shouts of triumph at their discovery. Seeing their developing synergy and predicting the following actions are supremely satisfying. Yet know this: there is little time for congratulations. Only a small minority will actually escape. Many will spend their final moments chasing red herrings. These odds of success are worsened, in my opinion, by the overpopulation of the groups. Six people would be ideal. Ten is too large a group for each member to be productive, leading instead to disorganization of collected items and chaotic rummaging of areas previously ransacked. My only other criticism would be that there should be a prevention of groups of friends from banding together. Part of the fun of the dynamic is the forced cooperation with people you know extremely little about. If you're abducted and locked in an abandoned office, you're unlikely to be coddled through the presence of your friends. That said, most people probably aren't approaching this hoping for excruciating realism. And honestly, would either complaint prevent me from returning once the puzzles are updated?Hell no.",13,0.965

They also sell food that i hope taste as good as the ice cream.

778,13,10,4.0,"Came for Kamayan night - where the food is spread all over the table on banana leaves and you eat with your hands.The hipster-maybe-Jewish server girl had an astounding ability to pronounce and explain Filipino dishes -- good job. They don't seat you until all the food has already been trucked onto the table. Well, trucked is a lousy phrase, because that would imply it is just poured indiscriminately onto the table. After our meal, we were able to watch another Kamayan meal get set up on the table across from us. They start with rice, then with sanitary gloved hands, grab food from various plates and lay it across the rice. The end result looks simple, but really takes some effort.What else should you know?- About not getting seated until your table is already prepared and ready to go food wise. This may occur 30-40 minutes after your stated reservation time because Filipinos. Don't arrive hangry.- You get a hand towel to wipe up before you start, but really if you're interested in keeping things clean, wash your hands and ignore the towel. They take them away symbolically to prevent you from cheating during the meal.- How do you eat with your hands without licking your fingers? Simple. grab some food with your thumb and index and middle fingers and let it rest on the latter two. Then, like a pinball machine shooting a ball into the playing field, use your thumb to guide the wad of food into your mouth. Once sauce has really soaked into the rice, you're screwed. Just have a slop pile in front of you that you corral with your fingers once in a while. Saucy rice can be picked up if you can get it all together in one place.- Leave a hand clean so you can do stuff like wipe your nose. It might run (mine did) if you have the Bicol Express. This is OK, guys. If the other hand never touches food, it's NOT A PROBLEM. And you have no napkins, so what else can you do?- If you get beer, get it by the pitcher. We didn't know it was an option. But frankly, if eating is the name of your game, don't get beer at all.- Speaking of eating, WAY TOO MUCH FOOD. Lotsa doggie bags. If you were keeping clean like I told you how, this won't really be a problem, because the food won't be all spitty!- Also speaking of eating, what should you order? My two favorites were dinuguan (stew with pork-blood sauce) and Bicol Express. Puto was nice too as it is fried and not steamed as it usually is. If I had to do it again, I would pay the couple bucks extra for the whole fried fish. It looked AMAZING.- Eating-with-hands-wise, you're off the hook once the main meal is over. Halo-Halo is served with spoons, though you're still sharing. Our group of 7 got 2 big sundae cups of halo-halo.- Finally, with the check, tax and tip is included at a 20% rate if you are a party of 6 or more. After observing the work that went into serving the meal, it's worth it. This is actually service -- they get their (gloved) hands dirty for you! But keep in mind that if you were budgeting $40 per person, it's really $50 per person after tax and tip. And more if you get beer. So it's not cheap. But it's definitely a unique experience, and the food is great.Get it? Got it? Good. Now get dirty and don't forget to take it slow and have fun Filipino style! Kamayan is the Filipino version of ordering massive meatballs and pasta dishes at red sauce restaurants -- not really about the food (though most of it's great), but about the people you come with and talk to while you're chowing down!",16,0.997

It can be very messy and off putting... well, for most people that is. I just try not to make any eye contact during meals like this... you shouldn't either. No first dates here obviously.So let me break it down for y'all. Basically, The Boil is the more expensive NYC version of ""The Boiling Crab"" for all you Californians/Texans who know what I'm talking about. That being said, everything I have ever ordered here has been just as tasty from the soft shell crab sandwiches to the gigantic king crab legs to the freshly killed crawdaddies. I highly suggest you grab a friend or four and head on over here to order a bunch of different crustaceans at once to engage in mass carnage.

780,16,15,4.0,"Let me tell a story... I always hated Italian food because at first impression it was about starchy carbs and cheese. Then one day I ate a Black Linguini and it blew my mind. Subsequently I developed this sick-positive feeling towards pastas because a revelation came to me that pastas are kinda reminiscent to Northern Chinese handmade noodles. And the biggest irony is that I was never a fan of those Chinese noodles! But I LOVE pastas now... Oh those HOMEMADE pastas here are absolutely delizioso. Rich, thick, aromatic and smooth. Eccellente!! I already can't wait to come back for another casual meal.Anyways... There are tons of restaurants along 9th ave in this neighborhood but Cara Mia kinda stood out for me because the the savory tastes it offered.

781,9,7,4.0,"After coming back from a massage, I was in the mood for beef. A burger, specifically. Thinking through my options, I decided to go big and head to the Spotted Pig, seeing as I'd already treated myself and had wanted to come here for some time. After hearing that there was a 30 minute wait, I noticed some stools around a beam in the back. I was able to grab a seat there which isn't ideal but actually pretty cool for people watching. As you could expect for a mock British pub, the Spotted Pig is dark and uber cool, with plenty to look at and a lot of scenesters. Service was good when I had their attention and distant otherwise; after all, I was quietly eating alone and thus unlikely to tip them well (wrong). Some also bumped into me a few times bringing out food for others , which isn't too big of a deal given how tight the space was, but they still could've manage a quick ""sorry"". Luckily I was here solely for the food, and it delivered.The chicken liver toast was probably one of the best things I've eaten recently. It was rich, fatty, and fruity all at once. The toasted bread it came on was perfectly suited, being at once crisp and pillowy soft. Why can't other restaurants put out excellent appetizers like this for $6? Along with a glass of their house Spotted Pig Bitter (brewed by Brooklyn Brewery specifically for them), this was a great start to the meal. I enjoyed the burger as well to a lesser degree. It came a perfect mid rare and was very flavorful, but unfortunately was overshadowed by a heavy hand with the roquefort cheese. Don't get me wrong, I love a burger with blue cheese and this was an awesome, salty, funky blue cheese. But it's so strong and there needed to be less of it to balance out with the beef. Next time, I'm getting it on the side. The homemade shoestring fries are more like homemade potato stix, and they're awesome. Get the homemade mustard and ketchup for dipping, and you'll be happy so long as you aren't counting calories. I'm not sure if this deserves the #3 ranking they got awhile back in the Daily Meal's top burgers nationwide list, but it was damn good--as was the rest of the food. Next time I need a good burger, this will be high on my list. Not to mention the rest of the menu...",11,0.9984

It is the same pieces as if you both ordered the 15 piece omakase (minus the handroll) but you save $25-Ask for the toro tasting (lean blue fin, chutoro, otoro)-Ask for the uni tasting (Maine, Santa Barbara, Hokkaido Japan)-Ask for the live scallop. This was the best scallop I've ever had; it had been dead literally 10 seconds before it was in my mouth-Converse with the Chef, he's funny and cute-- and ladies, did I mention SINGLE?!All in all, a great meal. I was able to try some new fish I've never tried before such as baby eel and baby squid.

I wanted a place with a really good omakase, but we had plans to meet up with friends afterward, so I also needed to be sure we could get a table without a super long wait. Kanoyama fit the bill perfectly. The sushi did not come out one piece at a time, with strict instructions to finish each morsel within a minute, so I know it wasn't the sort of Jiro-shit that's in vogue these days, but that totally didn't matter. We each received a perfectly gorgeous glass platter adorned with a rainbow of fresh, delicious fish. The presentation was really quite lovely, and that went for the different dishes other diners were ordering as well. Really elegant looking stuff. I was most blown away by how wonderful the fish tasted though. There was a really nice range of textures, with buttery tuna, slightly chewy octopus and tender eel each making an appearance. I opted for the sushi menu, which served one roll and all the other pieces of fish over rice. Boyfriend got the sashimi menu, which had the rice on the side in a bowl, and came with one more piece of fish. We had a good time swapping bites and enjoying the best of what the chef had to offer. It was all delicious, and $37 and $40 respectively--a good deal for an omakase!It was a decent amount of food, especially when you factor in your choice of miso soup or fresh, gingery salad, and a big scoop of vanilla, green tea or red bean ice cream for dessert. Plus, once we had polished off all the fish, we discovered a really good flavor combination from the garnishes on our plate: shiso leaf, ginger, wasabi and soy sauce taste really awesome together. We washed it all down with a chilled bottle of sake. A great meal. Kanoyama is not particularly original or out of the box, but it is a great example of high quality, straightforward sushi.",14,0.9989
786,5,3,4.0,"FINALLY got a chance to visit the 2 Yayoi Kusama infinity rooms recently and it was well worth the wait! It's more ideal to come on a weekday if you can, but if you can only make it on a weekend be sure to get here plenty early. I recommend getting here as early as 8:30am and toughing it out. If you arrive at this time, it'll probably be about a 1 hour wait only (for the The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away room) when the doors open at 10am. Luckily the ""Love is Calling"" room had no wait at all so we went to the Lights room (door closer to 11th Avenue) first and then immediately went into the Love room (door closer to 10th Avenue). I heard the wait for people at the back of the line was up to 5 hours, so dress very warmly and wear ALOT of layers on your feet, body and head.Although the wait can be long for the Light room, it can be fun if you bump into the right people on the line like my friend and I. We chatted it up with a few linemates the entire time and it was an absolute blast waiting with them. It's amazing the people you can meet randomly! We chatted about everything from who we were, our careers, schools to topics like movies, funny current events and personal experiences of waiting.As for the Light room, there is another 15 minute wait inside the gallery once you get in. In that time, you are given ""booties"" to wear on your feet to keep the infinity room clean. You also get a preview of the Light room as the door opens everytime to let the next person in. Once you get in, you are timed and given 60 seconds to do whatever you like in the room, including snap photos. I recommend snapping as many photos as possible at the start and then looking around after. As you walk in, you notice the pond of water surrounding your standing platform. The lights flicker throughout the 60 seconds and the room goes dark at one point as well. It's quite an interesting experience.After you're done, head straight to the Love room. Same scenario - Booties on and 60 seconds, however many people can go into the room at once. Once inside, you'll immediately notice all the colors and mirrors. Once again, snap as many photos as possible and then take a look around to appreciate it. After you leave, you get to go to a room where a ""CREEPY"" video of Yayoi Kusama is shown. It's a bit weird, but I guess the entire exhibit is. Overall, well worth the unique experience as it's being shown only a limited amount of time, so go quick before it ends!",15,0.998
787,8,7,4.0,"RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW! ...and look at that, review #500 for me too :)Nothing says ""cool date night"" like heading over to the Plaza Hotel in search of Macauley Culkin and the rest of the Home Alone 2 cast! Kidding aside, we went downstairs, snaked through the Plaza Food Hall (yeah, somewhat confusing, but check our their Yelp page to clarify: yelp.com/biz/the-plaza-f…) and eventually landed in the TODD ENGLISH Food Hall. The layout here is really interesting - Designed by Jeffrey Beers (who also designed the Plaza Food Hall), Todd English's Food Hall features open kitchens - eight in total - scattered around the restaurant, each surrounded by white marble dining bars. A wine bar, flatbread station, raw bar, pasta station, grill and more....It's like someone took your college cafeteria and dipped the whole thing in steroids.Assuming there are seats available, you can sit around any of the kitchens/stations, or opt for one of a few centrally-located high-top communal tables; no matter where you sit, the full menu is available. Servers, chefs, and managers are all armed with radios and earpieces and all were moving in sweet symphony running to the various kitchens, bringing plates to tables, busing old dishes, and providing new plates and silverware (we got four new sets in total).We started off our restaurant week orders with the lobster hush puppies (four per order) and the shortrib tacos (two per order), splitting everything. The hush puppies had a nice lobster kick and the tartar sauce smeared on the plate beneath gave it some much appreciated ""juice."" The shortrib tacos were generously stuffed, to the point that some of the filling spilled out, but that's nothing a quick fork can't fix! The accompanying clumpy and flavorful cotija cheese is miles ahead of that grated crap that other Mexican restaurants use for decoration (and nothing else really).The first of our two entrees to come out was the slider sampler (chicken parm, beef, and prime rib), and we thoroughly enjoyed all three, as well as the generous portion of parmesan fries that accompanied. Following was the ricotta gnocchi - although it appeared small, the plate was packed to the brim with juicy braised lamb, dried tomatoes, and BACON FOAM! (what?!) The gnocchi was cooked perfectly and this whole plate was definitely the best thing we ate during our visit!Rounding out our restaurant week selections, we opted for one of each of the two available desserts - the flourless chocolate cake, and the flan. Both plates arrived well-decorated and well-thought out, and we finished every last bite! (check out the pictures I took below!)I should also mention that we augmented our restaurant week selections with the Sea Dragon (specialty sushi roll w/ BBQ eel and shrimp tempura - 8pcs), and a round of specialty cocktails. Ordering a-la-carte, you realize your sushi costs $22 and those drinks another $32 total, but hey, what the hell? Having said that, the drinks were awesome, but they could have added another two pieces to that pricey sushi roll we ordered...All in all, they do many things really really well. I'll definitely be back to snack on some regular menu items, in particular their burgers and flatbreads. Enjoy!",12,0.996

789,10,7,4.0,Staff acknowledged me the minute I walked in and immediately offered their assistance. I asked for a specific vintage and unfortunately they didn't have it in stock. Regardless they offered several viable alternatives based on budget and their recommendations are definitely stellar contrary to some other establishments who had no knowledge of their products.I'll definitely be coming back to get more wine from them. On a side note they also do delivery in the local area.TLDR Good place to get wine if you're not too picky but if you're looking for specific rare vintages go somewhere else.,12,0.3291

The server made sure that the entire table had their glasses of water filled and even the manager came around to check.2. The food: was some amazing, I order the Seafood Paella, one of the best I had in my life, it was a little spicy, but just perfect, I thought they read my mind in these one. The Paella is probably the most famous and popular Spanish dish around the world; In this Paella was plentiful in fresh seafood and had perfectly cooked rice. It was just perfect for me. I also had some Platano (frito verde) and yuca frita very good.Two of my friend, they ordered, El Arroz con Pollo, they told me that is was incredible.

I am not nor have I ever been one to agree to a karaoke bar that doesn't have a private room for me to plop myself down in and belt out Total Eclipse of the Heart. But there i was, at Planet Rose, doing just that with my friends and a bunch of people that I don't know- but they were my BFFs 4EVA right then and there. AND THERE IS A PHOTO BOOTH. All caps are totally necessary on that one. Because of the size it is a more intimate experience than you would expect. There was a point where I was dancing around with a total stranger and pretending to know the words but really just opening my mouth and closing it again like a giant carp (while surreptitiously trying to peek at the screen and still failing magnificently at not pulling off whatever song it was that I was carping to).

794,10,9,4.0,"As I suspected, Fay Da is the bomb for all things non-dessert related! My friend and I wanted a cheap, savory breakfast after a night of debauchery and dance-induced paralysis. Initially on our way for some bagels, we stopped into Fay Da instead to see what selection they had. I do not kid you when I say they have things as cheap as $1.60! Penny pinchers rejoice! You can literally buy a FEAST for $5. How amazing is that? Warning for you credit card addicts, however, that this place is CASH ONLY. I went for the tuna pastry and split-pea scallion bread twist. My friend ended up buying a lychee bubble tea (her first one ever; shocking, I know), a milk bun, a sticky pork bun (another first), a puff pastry of some sort, and a mango mochi for later. My total came out to only $2.85. Bazinga! Prices I could groove with. When we finally sat down, I practically inhaled my tuna pastry. The mix of slightly creamy tuna chunks mixed with the sweeter pastry exterior was great. The bread twist was also tasty, but nothing exceptional and a bit too oily. The friend loved her sticky pork bun but our love affaire with the milk bun was on another level. It looks like a regular sesame roll but when you bite into the gem, all you can think is this is what writers for centuries have been calling ""love."" A slightly saccharine-dry condensed milk mixture is found against the fluffy interior making you feel all warm and fuzzy inside like a hug from your grandmother usually does. While I know I'll definitely be back for some more Fay Da soon, the only reason I can't give a five star is because of the mysterious puff pastry my friend got. She slowly revealed this palm-sized ""treat"" and told me it was a preserved egg pastry. After taking a small nibble, she enjoined me to take the first real bite. Always down for a new foodie experience, I obliged. Holy mother of g-d this thing was awful. A strange, other-worldly mixture of ginger-fig paste filled the inside and as I retracted my horrified mouth from the pastry, I was privy to the BLACK egg on the inside. To say I gagged profusely would be an understatement. Of course, said friend found this hysterical and carefully discarded the ""thing."" Amusing? Maybe, but my taste buds were left contemplating what in the hell were you thinking???",11,0.9859
795,10,4,4.0,"After more than a half a dozen visits to the new location.. I think it finally does warrant a review as they have nicely settled into the act of serving beautiful cocktails.What hits you as you walk in is that the new interiors are rather barren, and there's plenty more seating available. They also have started serving small bites here, which is always welcome. While the first couple of times the cocktails were hit or miss.. by now M&H and I have eased back into our comfortable relationship. I know how to communicate my order, and they know exactly what to give me. My favourite bartender from Lantern's Keep has also moved here.. so that's a plus in my book too.In several ways, the new place is an antithesis of the old one. Located in a much less grungy locale., the new storefront is a lot less 'little tailor shop' and a lot more 'construction site'. There's no doorbell, it's a huge space, and (gasp) they accept credit cards. I suppose one could say many of these changes are improvements over the old format. And yet... there's some of the charm missing. Perhaps I just need to walk through thick black velvet curtains and feel the aroma of spices and herbs and fruit oils hit me to feel like I am transported to a different time. I just liked feeling all intimate and having my drink orders repeated back to me in hushed tones.

797,11,7,4.0,"Let's get this out of the way, watching Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares show has been a guilty pleasure of mine for many years. With that in mind - I was always curious about any dining establishment that was good enough to bear his name (regardless of his actual input in the food or menu). That was part of what drove me to check out MAZE.I came in with higher expectations than usual for a normal restaurant. After all, given all the shit that Gordon throws at other inept operators, one would expect this place to maintain some pretty high standards. I am glad to report that for the most part I was extremely impressed with my overall experience.The food:We decided to mix things up by trying the Chef's 5-course menu and the Pre-Theater 3-course menu. As for the 5 course menu - here are my prime takeaways:Turnip Veloute - My meal kicked off with a splash. This creamy bisque-like soup was surprisingly flavorful and I recommend people try each spoonful with a different mouthful of ingredients. I noticed the texture and flavor of the soup was very different depending on whether you mixed it with a bite of turnip, apple or raisin. It was a great way to start things off.Beetroot Salad - This was also a nice showcase of flavors, with the goat cheese playing a bigger role than I expected compared to the beets and other handful of sauces and ingredients that came paired with the few leaves of grilled romaine lettuce. Definitely liked the feel of the goat cheese juxtaposed with the fruity compote that was included. My only beef here was that the size of the salad was so small - it offered few opportunities for someone to really indulge in the myriad of flavors presented here.Sea Scallops - My favorite item of the night. The scallops were absolutely fresh and cooked to perfection. The cider aioli and herbed panko were the perfect combination to the succulent and rich flavor of the scallops. If only they served this item as a full-blown entree, I would definitely order this again in significantly larger quantities in the future.(Seabass or NY Strip Loin - I went for the latter)NY Strip Loin - Very well cooked slices of prime beef that melted in your mouth like butter. My request for medium rare was a fine decision, given that it added to the texture of this well cooked piece of steak. The spinach, portabello and potato confit were all nice additions to this meal, but all in all they were very small accompaniments. My only gripe here was that their version of the steak sauce was less than overwhelming and the underlying sauce under the steak itself also was only so-so for me and didn't do much to improve the taste of the entree. I think the steak was perfectly fine in of itself.(Dark Chocolate Decadence or Pain D'Epices - Went with the former)The Dark Chocolate Decadence was fine, but frankly I didn't think this particular dessert was that impressive. It was a bit too dry for my liking and at times felt like I was eating a very rich (albeit small) chocolate brick.As for the 3 course menu - here was what my lady tried:Turnip Veloute (see above)Crispy Salmon - The fish was well cooked and the crispy skin greatly added to the flavor and texture of this dish. The truffle honey ricotta was also a nice pairing with this item.Pain D'Epices - Probably the best dessert of the bunch we tried that night. Originally she ordered the Pineapple Maple Cake but this dessert was delivered to her by mistake (they did replace it later on without any incident). This little panna-cotta like dessert was the most balanced and least overwhelming of the bunch we tried. The service:In short, the service was extremely disciplined and the waiters were all extremely polite and met our requests immediately. While they made a mistake with our dessert order, they immediately rectified the problem. I was impressed at how at least in this particular restaurant it seems they do hold on to the adage that Gordon preaches, which is the customer is always right. The decor:Lastly I thought the decor of the restaurant was tasteful and the ambiance was pleasant. It was classy, modern but not overly stuffy. The only gripe I had was that some of the tables were placed too close to each other.Overall - I was glad to see a restaurant that bears Gordon's name lived up to most of my expectations. Given what he expects from other restaurants, it's good to see this place didn't deviate from his mantra of high quality food and excellent service.As for people looking for big portions - this is not the kind of restaurant where you look to get stuffed like the Olive Garden",14,0.9983

You're in for a treat because you know that the food will be solid, and especially because you become the audience to conversations that almost comically show the extent of seniority-based status relationships, whether you know the language or not.The restaurant uses SEO's space at night, so there are a few counter seats and plenty of tables for larger parties. The place still had a good room of open seats on a Saturday at 1am. The menu is quite limited with only 3 different types of ramen (shoyu, shio, and tsukemen), and an assortment of small appetizers (but $4 for edamame?!). This makes for pretty quick service - service that is appreciated when your stomach is growling for some late-night, (mostly) unhealthy grub. The edamame ($4) was a big portion, though, and salt was scattered atop and throughout. The shoyu ramen ($9.80) was also quite a large portion for being under $10, and came with two slices of seared pork, menma (fermented bamboo shoots), green onions, and half of a soft-boiled egg. While the menma and soft-boiled egg were less than desirable, limp toppings, the seared pork was surprisingly very tender, juicy, not overwhelmingly fatty, and flavorful. The shoyu broth, while not too complex, was clean and straightforward. Perhaps my tolerance for salt has risen? I didn't think the broth was as salty as other reviewers have stated. The noodles were cooked al dente and were of the thinner kind.All in all, the ramen is a solid 3. I added a star for the concept and atmosphere. Cash only.

801,11,10,4.0,"So, this is a cool place, undeniably. Sweeping city views, nice water sunset views, trendy crowd, expensive (tasty) drinks, etc. As far as roof top views, this is one of the top 3 I have been to. I came here, most recently, with a group of 4 girl friends. We split a pitcher of cucumber sangria (good) and snagged a coveted table by the water. Our waitress was awesome. I think a pitcher was 60 bucks, but it was easily 2 drinks a person, so it seemed, (at the end of the night) to be a pretty fair deal. I like crepes and they have good ones here (for around 7 bucks).There is a jacuzzi/pool when you first walk in, and people were in it - like dancing in it. I am perhaps a slight germaphobe (like, I don't need to wash my hands after petting your dog, but I will need to wash my hands after holding a subway pole) and I think I would not get into this little pool ever. You can buy a bikini on the fly though, if you are into that. Overall, very ""cool"" spot. Honestly, I get a little overwhelmed at places that are super ""scene"" and this place is sceney. I feel most comfortable in a dive bar with chill music playing, this place is the opposite of that. The views though, are worth it. I saw multiple people get turned down at the door, even on a Wednesday evening. When we arrived, a group of girls in front of us got turned away and 2 guys got turned down.

802,11,10,4.0,"We sat around my friend's UES apartment debating whether to order in or visit Luke's--it was Snowpocalyse 2014, after all! Confusion with my Seamless and Grub Hub apps answered the question for us, so we braved the elements and trudged through the snow (which was pretty well cleared by Friday evening--props, UES!).At first glance, Luke's Upper East was more spacious and more comfortable than its East Village sibling. And luckily, there was a party of 3 leaving, just the right L shape for us to Tetris our way into the high table. The lobster traps and other Maine kitsch set a nice maritime ambiance without going overboard (zing!).The guy at the counter was hip and friendly. I got a lobster roll and my friend and the SO both went for the lobster grilled cheese sandwich. The latter was outstanding--gobs of cheese and chunks of lobster in between two slices of bread--what could be better? My lobster roll was delicious, comparable to the rolls I had in Portland, and came on one of those delicious split-top buns that are just perfect.There were some good beers on the menu, but me and my beau split a bottle of Thirsty Owl Riesling (Finger Lakes Strong!). The wine was on the dry side, crisp and refreshing, well paired with cold fresh seafood. They also have Maine root beers; not my thing but it might be yours. My companions ended the night by splitting some big, decadent chocolate cookie, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't dip in (it was good).Overall, a very good experience. I look forward to trying more stuff off the menu--they have a nice sample for ~$22 that gives you half portions of the lobstah, shrimp, and crab rolls, with all the trimmings (cole slaw, pickles, chip, drink).",14,0.985
803,27,23,4.0,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed the Kati Roll Company yet! Located a couple of blocks from my office, this is a frequent lunch spot for me, and by now, I have tried all of the different varieties of these Indian burritos. For the shell / wrap, you can choose between the layered paratha and the whole wheat roti; both options are tasty but the roti is healthier, for those who care for healthy options (this fat boy is not one of them!).  Here are some of my favorite rolls:- Unda roll: seasoned fried egg layered into a flat bread roll- Chicken tikka roll: chunks of spiced chicken rolled up into a flat bread shell. You can have Unda (seasoned fried egg) added to this one for a slight upcharge; I think it gives an added dimension to the roll and makes it even tastier.- Beef tikka roll: similar to the above, but more flavorful in my opinion. The Unda option is also available for this roll, and that makes this my favorite item here. - Shrimp masala roll: pretty self explanatory after reading the descriptions above. Very tasty; one of my friends gets two of these every single time, and has not tried any of the other ones because she feels like she has found what she loves and does not need to look any further. The Unda option is NOT available for this one, much to my dismay. They don't have the Unda option listed on their menu, and they don't budge from established practice. A couple of times, when I really wanted Unda in my shrimp masala roll, I just purchased a shrimp masala roll and an Unda roll, and combined them myself! - Channa masala roll: curried chickpeas in the roll; tasty enough, but not on the top of my list of favorites just because I am more of a meat lover. - Aloo masala roll: spiced potatoes in the roll. The Unda option (layer of fried egg, as described above) is available for this one. I hadn't expected the combination of egg and potatoes to be very good; but it did turn out to be quite tasty. I realized that, after all, we do eat breakfast potatoes with our omelet, so this worked just as well. They do not have restrooms here; be aware of that in case you decide to dine in. Like most of the restaurants in East Midtown where space is scarce, the interior is very cramped. The posters of Indian movies from the 60s is a nice touch. The minimum amount for a credit card charge is $9; but since I always eat at least two rolls, this has never been a problem for me.

804,18,11,4.0,"Le Bernardin is fantastic. The best NYC restaurants pale in comparison next to it, so why did I only give it 4 stars? Value. Let me explain...First, while judging my Le Bernardin experience I can only compare it against restaurants of a similar caliber. For me, this means comparing against Per Se and Eleven Madison Park. The food at all three are fantastic, the three best meals I have ever had. Presentation and quality are top notch. This review is only about value.Per Se costs $295 for the tasting menu. For that $295 you get 9+ courses, a wait staff seemingly assigned directly to you, a table for two that is about 8 feet in diameter, central park views, doggy bags with extra goodies, and of course fantastic food. Eleven Madison costs $225 for the tasting menu. In total there are about 16 courses including take home bags for breakfast, granola in glass mason jars and other goodies. No spectacular views here, and the density of the table placement is what you would expect out of a NY restaurant. Like Per Se and Le Bernardin, the food is fantastically presented and out of this world.Le Bernardin is $150 for a 7 course tasting menu, or $195 for an 8 course tasting menu. While the food quality and presentation is equal to the above two, the price per course is much higher. The little extras that Per Se and Eleven Madison throws in were not found here. No little goodie bag to take home for example. There were 4 little chocolates presented at the end of the meal where Per Se presented a tray of dozens. There is no fantastic view like Per Se, and the uniqueness of the menu did not meet Eleven Madison, so why was is it so much more expensive per plate?So, overall Le Bernardin is a 5 star restaurant with 3.5 star value. It is definitely worth trying, and if you have never been to Per Se or Eleven Madison you may see nothing wrong with the value as I have.",41,0.9888

806,16,12,4.0,"Nestled under the shadows of townhouses, Daisuke Nakazawa endeavors to escape a metaphorical shadow of his own - Jiro. Significant in the film only as anecdotal evidence to the singular drive to perfection Jiro demanded - Nakazawa spent years solely making tamago, the egg dish which concluded the meal - Nakazawa eagerly seeks to establish himself as an entrant worthy of a seat at the proverbial table of New York sushi icons and mainstays. At times, his eagerness is admirable. The house smoked katsuo (skipjack) is a hauntingly substantial take on humble katsuobushi, the smokiness imparted in a stunningly complex manner, accentuating the eating experience from initial aroma to the lingering taste. But occasionally, that same eagerness can come across as desperate, or at the very least, out of touch. Before the mantis shrimp tails are presented for your consumption, a live mantis shrimp is plucked from its shallow bath and plopped onto a plate just before you. Nakazawa holds it firmly, two long steel chopsticks acting the part of spinnaker poles, as the mantis shrimps billows underneath them, curling to and fro. ""He's a fighter,"" Nakazawa beams. ""Got me four times this morning. Dangerous!"" Some diners will shift uncomfortably, literally faced with the realization that in short order, they'll be eating something that was alive mere moments before it reached their plates. Others will retrieve their chopsticks and poke it themselves, first tentatively, like a dog would sniff an insect. Muffled squeals ring out in the long room at the mantis jutting out its woefully inadequate claws. Further prods are met with only open resignation through meek attempts to avoid the wooden jabs, the mantis seemingly aware of the consignment of its fate. It is at this point that Nakazawa will place the tail portion you are meant to eat next to the future tail portion, still attached to its bearer, wriggling frantically at the sensation of the severed limb of its compatriot only inches away. ""You want picture? Before and after!"" Nakazawa chuckles. Girls in dresses the size and vibrancy of handfuls of confetti hunt for the perfect Instagram filter. Other, more squeamish patrons politely decline. Mercifully, the tortured mantis is placed back in its bath, only to wait for the next group of diners to reach that hellish course. This served as one of the few instances in which I was grateful for my shellfish allergy. I could not fathom eating the mantis shrimp, having been forced to watch its peer wriggle and thrash next to the remains ready to be eaten. If it seems a trite point, consider the idea of having a yellowfin held next to the flayed flesh of its familiars, for the sake of inane photos sent to unknown followers. A difference in scale should not make one experience any more palatable than the other. It is also an odd practice given the general reverence ingredients seem to be held in. The salmon smoked in hay is smoked in hay handpicked by Nakazawa, who rides his bicycle to market early each morning to ensure he receives only the best fish.This teetering from approachability and gregariousness to extreme refinement is exacerbated by the omnipresent formality throughout the rest of the restaurant. Chairs are pulled gingerly from the bar when a patron enters, departs, or returns. Waiters and waitresses in sharply tailored garments stand deathly still just behind the row of the seated. The sake and wine lists begin reasonably but veer quickly into the obscene. In all, it would not seem to be an environment well-suited to spectacle. And yet, a spectacle is what Sushi Nakazawa ultimately is. This eagerness to cater to the instant dissemination of experiences to the vast wilderness of the internet seems a stark contrast to not only the severity of Jiro (a place at which you can finish your meal in twenty minutes, where eating is only interrupted by solemn nods or gruff interjections of approval) but to the idea, wrong or not, of upscale omakase as a zen like transcendental experience. It is fitting then that the sushi is not transcendent. The freshness is beyond question, as the mantis shrimp and the scallops shucked in plain view will demonstrate. The variety, while still leagues better than most, is a bit too reliant on subspecies of salmon to be considered without equal. Finally, the use of vinegar in the rice and the use of accompaniments generally, be they wasabi, yuzu, shishito, or the kosho like mustard, are too subtle to be appreciated. Most will likely be satisfied, but that is missing the point. Omakase at this level is not meant to be something which solely satisfies. It is meant to be sushi par excellence, impressing in the patron a desire to return, a testament by the chef that he or she is without equal. Ichimura has done it. Nakazawa still needs to find himself. In seeking to distance himself from Jiro, Nakazawa has inarguably succeeded. Perhaps, in ways very different than what he anticipated or intended.",16,0.9901
807,12,10,4.0,"This review is more of a praise for the medicinal merits of BCD tofu house than a testament to the quality of its food. I have been to BCD tofu house a number of times at the tail end of a long night of drinking. For about $20 a person you get a lot of food. They are known for their tofu stews. My favorite is the curry tofu stew although many have attested to the quality of their kimchi tofu stews as well. I personally can't take that much spice so late in the night.Like many Korean restaurants, in addition to your main course, you also get an assortment of side dishes or banchans. At BCD tofu house, you are always started with a personal serving of a whole crispy fried mackerel. You also get the usual assortment of kimchi cabbage, bean sprouts, seaweed, etc. When your tofu stew comes out, they give you a raw egg and also a bowl of rice to mix in it. For those that are squeamish about raw foods, the pot of stew is usually still boiling when it is placed in front of you so the raw egg should cook relatively quickly. From then on the meal becomes a blur of spoonfuls of tofu stew mixed with rice and mouthfuls of heavily spiced fermented vegetables. Perhaps the most magnificent thing about BCD tofu house is that I have never had a hangover on the mornings after eating here. I personally think it's because there is so much salt in their food that whatever sodium stores you lost from drinking is rapidly replenished when you inhale a bowl full of their fantastic stew.As with most chronic inebriates, I tend to ritualize my post drinking behavior to minimize unwanted consequences. In other words, I stick with what works. I am happy to say that BCD tofu house is quickly becoming a part of that ritual.",14,0.9651
808,9,3,4.0,"For those looking for some NYC standing history- this is one of the original places that withstood the tests of times to remain open today. Even though a lot has changed since the beginning, one thing remains- you will have fun.A little history lesson for those who are interested: The Stonewall Inn was popular amongst the most poorest and marginalized of gays during the 1960's: drag queens, representatives of a newly self-aware transgender community, effeminate young men, male prostitutes, and homeless youth. And it was their patronage that played an important role in the Stonewall riots of 1969- the beginning of the modern Gay Liberation Movement. The Stonewall Inn essentially gave birth to the 220 Club, and by extension, the movement behind the Riots. The infamous ""220 Club,"" at the time located at 220 West Houston Street (known today at The Brooklyneer), was one of the most famous transgender/gay nightclubs of the early 1970's. There, the seemly ongoing tradition of today's spontaneous drag shows (now seen at the Stonewall Inn) was started by a man named Sally Maggio- a stage actor, drag queen, and Entrepreneur with alleged ties to the Mafia. This one man singlehandedly solidified the cultural preeminence in the world of pre-op transsexuals, drag queens, cross-dressers, transvestites, male strippers and hustlers of every stripe and hue by welcoming them to his bar. It was here at 220 Club the courage of the gay community lead a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations against the police raid on the Stonewall Inn June 28th, 1969. At that time, police raids were common in gay bar as it was illegal to be openly gay in a public place. CAN YOU IMAGINE??! It was only then activist in the west village quickly organized to concentrate efforts on establishing places for gays and lesbians to be open about their sexual orientation without fear of being arrested. We see these efforts in the West Village today. The Stonewall Riot is widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for gay and lesbian rights in the United States! So sit back, dawn a brew, and remember the freedom fighters that sat in the same place you are in now with nothing but the dreams and hope of a better world with equality.",9,0.5461
809,9,13,4.0,"Yes, my friends, it never ends in NYC. Things keep getting better and better in the nightlife, and especially now that this place opened. First of all: Kiss and Fly was due for closure for a long time already. So.....Kiss and Fly was kissed goodbye, and got replaced with VIP Room, a top notch club that is in line and up to par with already existing awesome clubs like Lavo and Marquee. I expect to be coming back here more often to have fun at this new little hot spot in the Meatpacking District. Now... I can already see some reviewers coming up in the far distance, that I hereby want to spare from being disappointed or hurt, and from going to Yelp to post measly one star reviews out of revenge. I will gladly share with you in advance what I already know, and what I believe you should know (if you didn't know it already) so that you can't run to Yelp afterwards and be all like 'but nobody ever told me any of this!!!' You'll be an informed Yelper after reading this. : )-Is this place cheap? I never pay for anything, but I can already guarantee you that the answer is 'No'. All of NYC's top clubs charge top dollar for their drinks. For those of you that faint when a drink is between 15 and 20 bucks, I suggest happy hour in your local neighborhood pub. The other day I actually did pick up a bottle of water at the bar after offering the kind lady in the restroom a refreshment, and they charged me 8 bucks. You can do the math yourself from here.... ; )-Is the door hard? For most visitors I would say it is probably not considered EASY to walk in, as this is one of NYC's new hotspots. So as a good general rule of thumb, just leave those Ugg boots and smart ass remarks at home, or else you probably won't walk past the velvet rope here. Yes. Even you. Being early always helps of course, having tops 4 people in one group, ideally 50/50 boy/girl. Looks are everything in this scene. So just look your best, dress to impress. And for that girl that already started whining about not being let in, after RSVP-ing: I am sorry that they care enough about people's safety here, that they do such 'awful' things to you when they reach max capacity. Suck it up. It happens to everybody every once in a blue moon. You just had bad luck that night. Grow up. -What are the best nights? I had an AWESOME time when I visited last Tuesday.

This is a very relaxed bar, and if you didn't know better, you would never peg it for a cocktail joint. It looks like a normal, semi-dive bar. The difference is they serve quality quaffs and tasty snacks at reasonable prices. They have a tight list of original drinks and spins on classic cocktails. The Chai Old Fashioned is great. One of the most compelling things however is the vintage soda machine they use to make their own in house phosphates, which are absolutely stellar. Upon my first visit I tried a standalone shot of the cola, which they are thinking about bottling and selling. And they should, because it is BONKERS GOOD. Not overly sweet, and brimming with herbal and nutty notes, it's a clean, light but high flavor cola that is very addictive.On THE LIST, and somewhere I will definitely return.

813,11,11,4.0,"Since 2012, I have wanted to visited Sakagura. However, it seemed that we were never meant to be - first, Hurricane Sandy, then two rainstorms. Luckily, I finally met my dream restaurant Sakagura today.Similar to a mysterious man who desires to hide from his fans, Sakagura is located in the basement. Limited Internet may be frustrating at times. Nonetheless, it finally pushes me out of the comfort zone and looks into the eyes of my friends as I speak to them instead of staring at my phone. Without doubt, Sakagura is like an ideal man - it not only has an elegant decor, but also provides amazing Japanese food. The sake bottles on the shelves of the wall, the rice bags on cupboards and the bamboo design of the bathroom made me felt as if Sakagura brought me to Japan for a honeymoon. The housemade tofu was so smooth and silky that it slowly melted in my mouth. Although the tofu might not be flavorful as I expected, I was delighted by the salty sauce used on the tofu. Sakagura seems to be an all-rounded man who is able to cook both vegetarian and seafood dishes well, which is quite rare. My friend ordered shrimp tempura and the sake oyako don. He loved the light crispy batter on the shrimps, and the freshness of the salmon. No matter which dish Sakagura makes, it focuses on the original flavor of the dish, and does not let the sauce overpower the food. Yet, like all men, Sakagura is not perfect. It has a limited selection of food in its lunch menu. I unfortunately could not try tamagoyaki, and my friend could not have Buta Kakuni today.Nonetheless, all restaurants have flaws, but Sakagura's flaw is minor compared to all its amazing offers, ranging from decor to food.

I'll admit that that would have been my final opinion on the matter ... were it not for my brother and sister-in-law, who live a few blocks away from here and have made it their designated restaurant for low-key nights out. Funny story: I told my cousin about this place and she was amazed by the idea of an AYCE. So when we got there, she insisted on ordering almost everything on the menu (bear in mind, it's all-you-can-eat Japanese, not just sushi) After we'd eaten to our hearts content the waitress arrived with more menus so we could continue ordering. Sadly, we had to decline, but we left thoroughly satisfied. But for your trip here are a few helpful hints:- It's BYOB and there's a liquor store next door ... do the math- Try to pace because there's a lot of good food to try (really good onion soup, delicious sesame chicken, fresh yellowtail, fun specialty rolls)- Young kids (like my 16 month old) eat for free- They have food thats off menu (like lo mein) but that'll cost youHave fun!",15,0.9914

We tried the St. James Infirmary and Roses to Rags cocktails. Both were great. There are only 8 or so on the cocktail menu but I was assured by the bartender that there are at least 10 more just waiting to be debuted. There isn't a food menu just yet but I tried the gumbo which was pretty authentic. They had 3 dessert offerings and we had the absinthe cookies and bread pudding. Both were very boozy and paired well with drinks. I'm not sure how they'd fair sober. Just as biggie says, sky is the limit and you know you keep on, just keep on pressing on.

816,8,8,4.0,"Summary: Thumbs up on food... get the pork buns. Expect to wait (there are people you can pay to do this for you though). A little loud. It's more like 4.5. Lost the 1/2 star on noodle quality and ""delight"" factor. Atmosphere: Much larger and trendier than the other ramen joints, this is one spot you can bring your non-foody friends to and not have to explain the decor. Very Japanese, they welcome each guest in a traditional style that can be very fun and help start your dinner - after a long outdoor wait - with a smile.Service: We had great service. I really think they must manage this place extremely well for everyone to seem so happy to work here. They have these great I love ramen shirts. A great un-subliminal message to keep in mind. We got loads of water, which was great as I citibiked on over.The food: Never was such an astute group put together, IMO to rate noodles. I - despite my extensive Noodle Soup and World Noodle Soup lists - was among the amateurs for rating ramen as I attended Ipudo with Yelp veterans represented from three cities all with greater than 3 years of Yelp-elite status. My stomach was humbled and hungry at the same time.....Pork Buns - Great! Admittedly, I was concerned given all the undeserved raving about momofuku's pork buns. I gave those a 2.... a pork bun outside of Chinatown should improve on the concept. Here, with may and the right sort of additions, Ippudo achieves this.Agedashi tofu - A solid executionSamuri Ribs - Not bad. yum, but I would likely choose a different app next timeAkamaru modern - with the hard boiled egg ... 6 seasoned Yelpers and only one bothered to get something else! But like birds of prey honing in, we all knew it was the way to go. The broth was perfectly salted and just fatty enough to make you smile, but not so fatty it made you worried about daily oil consumption. The mix of ingredients was thoughtful and well blended.Scratch Tan Tan Mien - Eh...I always think the broth is too sweet as a result of the sesame. I say it was the wrong call for me specifically. However, it could be the right call for the guy next to you ....so you can try some and still have your lovely Akamaru modern... thank you Kevin L for letting us slurped up the leftover remnants of your soup.... Ok... so my issue was the noodle choice. They selected an ultra thin ramen. That decreased the noodle soup ""delight"" factor. I get it. It holds up well for large parties or for a restaurant that size and make the golden first-5-minutes-of-noodle-into-soup-entry-taste-awesomeness, less relevant. I even know that within the category of thin ramen noodles that are dried, this is probably superior. HOWEVER.... I struggled.... can I really give it 5 stars if it's not using superior uber fresh noodles? I was very torn internally. Then I remembered.... my lack of a star makes no difference, too many people have given this place 5 stars... so there you have it... 4 stars but 4.5 rating.",8,0.996

This place has been under my foodar for awhile already, on top of that, a Groupon deal has been purchased a few months back.The entrance is a solid wooden door, which can be missed and thought of as a door to the apartment building. The place was small and cozy. The ambiance was pretty modern and laid back at the same time. The servers are really friendly and attentive. For this place, I suggest a reservation is a must, unless you get there right at opening hours. We didn't reserve and we were fine by the bar because we got to see every order that came out.Bottom-less coffee...well I can't really give input on this one because I'm not much of a coffee drinker. It's good once, I added 2, 3, maybe 4 lumps of sugar to it! Yuzu mimosa, it's very citrusy and refreshing at the same time. I absolutely love it (I vouch for this)! Bloody samurai was okay. I prefer white wine over reds. To start we had the miso soup was actually pretty flavorful with chunks of tofu and heaping amounts of seaweed. The vinaigrette salad was very fresh and refreshing. I really love the combination and texture of the different types of vegetables here. Plus, I love the hint of pink peppercorn utilized in this dish. Apple smoked bacon was crispy and delicious...what more can I ask for from bacon?As for Hungry Boy's entree, he had the Lobster ramen with lobster miso broth. Lobster and ramen? Now that's something we both never had before. This ramen came with one lobster claw and half a tail. The lobster was slightly overcooked. The ramen had a good texture and the lobster miso broth was just WHOA! I mean literally, I wished Hungry Boy's phone would ring or something, so he be too busy talking and not see me scarf down the entirety of his ramen!For me, I always have a sweet tooth. So of course, I got the green tea chocolate pancake with raspberry maple syrup and black sesame ice cream. I wish it was waffles instead of pancakes lol. Anyway, the texture of the pancakes were...hmmm..let me put it this way, ""it's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!"" The pancakes were so airy and fluffy at the same time, it's kind of like a cross over between cotton candy and a cloud (not that I've eaten a cloud before, but if I have the chance I sure will). The pancakes alone were not overly sweet, it was just right. But topped with ice cream and drizzle of syrup makes it perfect!Overall, it was a great brunch date with delicious foods!

I came here to buy my bf's mom some yummy cold pressed olive oil and was happy to see various carving stations with jamons galore (they do a carving class! But it'll cost you). The best part about Despana as its little tapas, coffee, and sandwich (bocadillo) options. For tapas, I've tried two types of tortilla espanolas: the chorizo (I mean chorizo is yummy always), and the queso (cheesy, goodness). They make their omelets so fluffy and delightful. And not overly greasy.As for the other tapa: I had these flatbread thing with goat cheese and some weird-tasting onion jam (eh), and the pulpo (also eh, but cold pulpo is always eh). The goat cheese was good, though. Bf and I shared two bocadillos- the chorizo- just spicy awesomeness with some manchengo, and the serrano jam, which some even more awesome mancheno (soft and sharp) but this sandwich had a weird hint of mustard (something yellow) that I didn't care for. The best part was the dusty, crusty, and fresh bread. I would do that over a French baguette any day. And last but not least?

We chose Kutsher's because they were on Seamless (where we have a corporate account). I ordered the Pastrami Sandwich, Duck Fat Fries and the Sour & New Pickles. As for the Pastrami Sandwich, the quality of the meat was fantastic! Juicy, thick cut slices of pastrami. The meat was on the fattier side, but it was marbleized so it wasn't like I had to pull out big chunks of fat that were preventing me from otherwise enjoying my meal. The meat had a very smoky aspect to it as well, which gave it a unique and welcome flavor. The only unfortunate thing was the only mustard they gave us for the rye bread as little packets of Gulden's. I was expecting a fancier mustard: thicker with visible mustard seeds. This was really unfortunate because I felt like otherwise the sandwich was top notch. It was disappointing that they didn't have a better mustard to top it off.The Duck Fat Fries were great! They had the flavor of the duck fat and they were nice and crispy. They were shoestring fries, very thin pieces. They came with enough for 2-3 people, so it was a nice order to split among my coworkers. We also got a box of pickles. It was supposed to be both Sour & New, but they only gave us New pickles. Each Sandwich did come with a sour pickle and a new pickle, so it was very confusing that they wouldn't give it to us in the pickle box as well.Kutsher's was pretty good and I will probably order from them again. There were just a couple things that threw off what would have otherwise been an amazing lunch. Hopefully they figure these things out, then they should be a real New York deli contender.",9,0.9708
825,7,4,4.0,"I'm not sure how long that this has been going on, but apparently the Bowery Whole Foods has been hosting residencies for Smorgasburg vendors. The latest pop up, the Yuji Ramen Test Kitchen, has been there since March, serving simple lunches by day and an intimate multi-course tasting menu by night. Unfortunately, the aforementioned omakase sold out the entire duration of its scheduled run (until May 12) in about two days, so good luck snagging a spot at the 6 seat (!!) dinner counter. I just pinned my hopes on the wait list, which ended up panning out for me tonight, but the inside word from the staff is that they'll be extending their stay until August, so keep an eye out for new dates here: kitchit.com/tickets/YUJI…Why, might you ask? Because Chef Yuji is doing some really creative things with ramen noodles, that's why. Five courses are described only by a type of seafood: salmon, squid, uni, oyster and mussel. (You also get an assortment of pickled veggies to start things off.)My favorite was the salmon. which seemed to be a play on lox with cream cheese. There was cured salmon and creamy Camembert cheese, and lemon, shiso leaves, shredded nori and, my favorite, little crumbles of crispy salmon skin. The noodles were flat and wide, (like a thinner linguini), springy and chewy and amazing. Instead a broth, there was only a small amount of sauce, a style called mazemen. As an Italian, I dug it (I think I've always been a little suspicious of brothy pasta soups that are not chicken noodle, but I've been coming around). It sounds like a very strange combination, but it tasted great. There was a lot of nice textural contrast with the noodles and the creamy cheese and then salmon skin, and the sauce was awesome. The squid came in the form of a spicy tomato ragu with nori breadcrumbs over some strange black orechiette (it occurs to me now that this has to be from squid ink). This was not my favorite. I think the chewy pasta texture didn't work as well for me in the thicker shape. The idea of the squid ragu was interesting, but I think that the flavor of it maybe got a little bit muddled. I liked the uni a lot more. A whole wheat raviolo filled with a mixture of white miso and uni was topped with orange and shiso and a healthy dollop of raw uni. This also had a beautifully bright, citrusy sauce. As for the last two courses, they were pretty crazy. A cold, gelatinous broth, ponzu, poached bacon, minced cucumber, celery leaves and a freshly shucked oyster gets poured over a bowl of hot noodles, and transforms from a jelly into a gorgeous broth. It was wild to see, and the combination of smokey bacon and briney oysters tasted awesome. Then, as if that wasn't enough of an experience for you, the chef breaks out a blow torch and starts torching a chafing dish full of mussel shells, which he explains will infuse his broth with their smoke. And then the broth and the shells are put into a french press, and then you press down and pour the broth over the same noodles as dish #1, scallion and mussels. It's the only really traditional ramen/broth number of the meal, so I thought it was really clever to do such an unusual presentation. This also used a more traditional spaghetti-like noodle (I think from that place Sun Noodle) than the other dishes. It was all very good, and a very unique meal. And if the food wasn't enough to recommend this place, Yuji was very nice and did a great job explaining his dishes and answering all our questions. It's rare to hear firsthand from a chef about what you're eating and what inspired a dish, and it was great to witness his clear passion and pride for his craft. Pretty inspiring. Obviously this little joint is in Whole Foods, so there's not much of an atmosphere, but of the six seats, you definitely want the middle two, which afford the best view of the sweet blow torch action and the like.Lunch has a different menu, including one option that has bacon and egg and sounds like a slam dunk. Lunch items are about $9, the tasting menu is $40 on weekdays and $65 (for seven courses) on Saturday and Sunday. Weeknight seatings are at 6 and 8, weekends have just one seating at 7.",10,0.9993

Many of the dishes had a spice level of 3 chili peppers but it was missing the most important component of Sichuan food...the Sichuan flower pepper. While everything was perfectly seasoned and had a good amount of heat, it was missing that mouth numbing, licorice tasting, zesty slap in the mouth that I was hoping for. However, make no mistake, my friends, Han still puts out some of the best Sichuan dishes in the New York area.My favorite dishes of the night: spicy crispy cucumbers, wonton in chili oil, and pork belly in garlic sauce. I'm not usually a fan of cucumber salads, but this low key dish was crispy, crunchy, briny, and spicy and was both refreshing and addicting. It is definitely something I could eat as a meal with rice and be completely satisfied.Overall, a welcomed edition to Union Square and just in time for the cold of winter.",10,0.9819
827,9,8,4.0,"You Guys! Hill Country Chicken doesn't suck! Which is weird because the full blown BBQ restaurant by the same name is incredibly mediocre. I don't know what ""healthy"" means so when TBW and I hear of a new fried chicken place near our apartment, we immediately round up friends and go. We went in one night and ordered the fried chicken of course. We weren't sure what we wanted, and the friendly staff helped us choose. I ordered two boneless fried chicken tenders and a drumstick. I also ordered sides: Pimento Mac and Cheese, Cheesy Fried Mashed Potatoes and some creamy coleslaw. The chicken was unreal. But only the chicken tenders. Really, really moist and extra crispy skin. Fairly hearty in size as well. You get two for $6.00 and with some sides, you really don't need much more. The drumstick was just okay, it doesn't even hold a candle to places like Pies and Thighs, but it was decent enough. I ate most of it. But the chicken tenders are amazing and you should get that instead. As far as the sides go, I wasn't thrilled with anything, except the mac and cheese. I don't understand why their mac and cheese is so good, but just around the corner at the main restaurant it was so bad? That's stupid. Anyway, I loved it, except for the pimentos, mostly because I don't like pimentos, but they were pretty easy to pull out. Or - stop being such a sissy and suck it up and eat it, for the love of pasta and gooey cheese. The mashed potatoes were not really mashed, they were more like a breakfast hash, and were pretty good, but I could skip them next time. We ordered too much food, so we talked about how we could and would cut back the next time we dine here, which will be very soon. The cole slaw was very good, very classic and crunchy, not dripping in sauce, which is nice, and it paired well with the chicken. Of note: I forgot to order a biscuit before paying, but TBW said it was hardly worth it. And he loves breads like you read about. Why can't Hill Country as a company get their breads right? The seating is first come, first served and there are mostly communal style tables. The biggest problem with this was that many people were sitting around playing cards or board games, which makes it hard for those of us with hot food to snag a seat and start eating. I think the restaurant should have a policy about getting up and going when you are done. While the seating area isn't small, it's not too large either, so letting people sitting around for hours once their meal is over really takes away from those who want to dine there - and subsequently can't get a seat. We also tried dessert because JAK (my bestie who also joined us for the meal) had read about them and they did sound delicious, so we went up to the counter a second time to grab some treats. We wound up getting quite a few, mostly just to try: Whiskey Buttermilk (weird, but I really liked it. TBW & JAK really didn't though.), Cowboy pie (I didn't like it, it was very hard to eat because it was so stiff, TBW liked it, JAK didn't love it), S'mores (TBW was the only one who liked it, but said it was only okay. I was hardly impressed) and the Texas Billionaire Pie (also mediocre). I wouldn't bother with the pies because then you can have more chicken and that's what the real star is here, not that you should be surprised when it's right in the name, and the sides are far better than regular Hill Country, although still only pretty good and nothing too stellar. I do want to try the fries next time and the corn dish, which they had run out of by the time we got there.AND - if anyone cares of my opinion at all, which I'm sure very few of you do, this place should skip their breakfast and be open until midnight or later, it's the perfect location for some BBQ food after the bar. But only being open until 10, that doesn't really help me or any other imbibing New Yorker. Just a thought. But seriously do it. Okay, thanks.",10,0.999

For cotton balls, quetips, nail polish, umbrella, (insert other random girl crap here) Cosmetic Market has the goods at very reasonable prices. My fiance even enjoyed browsing and ended up buying several large bottles of hand sanitizer and a cutting board for his kitchen. (Weird, I know)I bought a nice little compact Samsonite umbrella for $7 (I'll let you know if it breaks in the first rain storm) and an 8 oz bottle of hand sanitizer for $1. The umbrella certainly looks to be as good of quality as the umbrellas I see sold elsewhere in the city for $15, although that's not saying much.

829,9,7,4.0,"I walked on the grubby streets around port authority where mysterious smelly liquids lurk around in pavement cracks and trash freely flying around on the streets. And then there was a tall dark door and I entered it. There was a long marbled corridor and I walked on it for a while. Dude, it was a long corridor. A beautiful lady greeted me and I was taken to the beautiful lounge with soft music where they made pretty drinks.I have tried several drinks on the menu and they tend to be pretty well balanced. Let me be clear, this is no Milk & Honey. They have plenty of vodka drinks and a few are too sweet and I'd always choose Macao Trading Company over Hakkasan for Asian fusion cocktails, but listen: for the most part these are solid cocktails. The Rum Daisy, the plum sour and bird's eye margarita are a few that come to mind.Their bar snacks as well as dining offerings are quite tasty - personally the mushroom lettuce wrap with pistachios and peanuts despite its saltiness is one of the yummiest appetizers I have eaten in recent memory. While the dumplings don't quite match up, they'll do nicely until the dinner menu becomes available at the bar.The dinner menu has enough vegetarian options and the veggie ""chicken"" dish is really flavourful. Their desserts all sound super interesting but I've only tried two so far. The sesame chocolate cremeux is this really quite intense dessert that takes over your tastebuds, while the pistachio 'parfait' is a tongue-in-cheek take on a parfait and what it would have been if someone real clever had created it.Hakkasan is the opposite of everything that port authority stands for - it's luxurious and expensive and stylish. And of course they have made every effort to shield this place from its surroundings (including the long corridor). So the next time your friends from out of town want to hang out in Times Square and AND a fancy restaurant nearby, you don't have to tell them that's impossible.",10,0.9904
830,13,11,4.0,"If you're a visitor, don't come here; go to Totto Ramen instead. If you live in NYC and enjoy a good bowl of noodles, this is a good place to try. Hide-Chan ramen will not change your life, but it deserves a solid 4 stars for doing what they do very well. Their selling point is that you can choose the richness of the broth (medium or rich) and the doneness of the noodle (well done, medium, firm, extra firm) - take advantage of this offering!I highly recommend getting a broth-base OTHER THAN tonkatsu. Yes, the creamy bone broth has become the standard broth in American ramen culture, but this is not the place to get it. While gelatinous and tasty, there are better options elsewhere in NYC. Instead, opt for the shoyu (pork or bonito-based) broths, as they are lighter, more complex (umami!), and may give you an eye-opening experience to what you're used to when the word ""ramen"" comes to mind. Also, the ""spicy"" option here is not spicy whatsoever.Other dishes - the fried chicken appetizer (kaarage) was delicious. The gyoza other tables got looked delicious, and apparently you can get different toppings such as cheese and scallions! Be sure to order the annin tofu (sweet almond tofu) for dessert - it's to die for!So, noodle texture & soup - I really enjoyed their extra firm noodles, which were thin and very al-dente, just how I like them. The medium firm noodles are wavy and chewier, and also extremely delicious and exactly how good ramen should be cooked. The ""medium"" broth is the perfect richness - the people who complained about the saltiness of the broth probably got the ""rich"" option, in which case, duh, it will be salty.Lastly, don't compare this place to Totto or Ippudo because you will be disappointed. This is solid, standard, ramen you actually find throughout Japan, not new age/innovative/fusion Japanese ramen. Hide-Chan is great at what they do, and I will definitely be back to try their black mayu/garlic ramen, which apparently won them some awards. If you are a noodle person, be sure to add this eatery to your list!",25,0.9977
831,9,8,4.0,"I freakin' love this place. Great vibe, and at any moment you'll think Ricky Ricardo is just going to pop up out of the woodwoork.Whether if it's date night or a birthday party, I always find this place to be quite dependable. The high energy vibe definitely fits all bills, unless you're looking for a very quiet evening. This place can get loud. It seems on most evenings this place is fairly packed and it was no different the last time I paid a visit (despite the soaking rains that got pretty much everyone wet on a Friday night).The service here is top notch. The waiters are all very friendly and attentive. They even go out of their way to make sure folks have a great night. They even gave my friend a free flan for his birthday. Nice little thing for them to do, for sure.But in the end, folks are here for the food and they deliver for the most part on this front. The much-talked about ropa vieja is nice. The meat is incredibly tender and goes perfectly with the rice. Not sure about the people who complained about the lack of rice/beans here - they will gladly give you more upon request (we were offered more without even asking). The Lechon Asado/roast suckling pig is also delicious. The meat here is also incredibly tender. If you had to pick between this and the Ropa Vieja, I would say you can't go wrong either way. Best option would be to just have one person order each and share. Or if you just want a taste of it all - I've had their Taste of Cuba combination before and it was excellent. Not only do you get both of those dishes (albeit small portions of it), you also get to taste their Camarones Enchilados/shrimp - which is also awesome. Separately - also worth mentioning - the crusted red snapper - great flavor.The desserts here are good. I personally like the flan, though I'd like to warn you that it is heavier than it looks. Another + = their good sangria. Definitely get a pitcher of this when you hit this place up.All in all it's a good place to spend the night with friends or family. It's also convenient for folks who want to get a taste of Cuba and catch a show all in one night.",9,0.998

She'd be perfect--a cultural mutt with a saucy personality.Curry-Ya's a teeny place--a counter with seating for maybe 15. The staff work on the opposite side of the counter, firing up the curry bowls and doing all the prep right before you. It's not particularly elaborate, but it's still fun to watch your food be made. I had the ""classic"" beef+veg curry, with additions: extra veggies, a hard-boiled egg, and cheese. Delicious! All the curries I saw looked equally delicious, like you maybe can't go wrong no matter what you get.One important note on spiciness: they offer these curries in mild, medium, and hot. The hot here is equivalent to mild almost anywhere else. It makes Cholula seem like actual hot sauce, if that means anything to you.There isn't much else on the menu besides curries. A few salads (no idea, didn't see any on the counter) and one or two desserts (""coffee jello"", didn't try) but not much else.Service is terrifically friendly.

If you've answered yes to all of these, then you'll definitely need to try out the Russian & Turkish Baths.

The atmosphere and lighting of this place reminds me of Bond movie where some gang would hide out and torture people. There are showers and small little heated rooms that can be slightly intimidating if you have an imagination. The center pool is where most people sit to wait for their desired treatments. It's what I like to call the ""blue beauty"" because it makes everyone look magnificent and extremely photogenic when they splash into it (right after they open their mouths and give an inaudible grunt when they realized they've put their body into shock from jumping into almost freezing water).There are a variety of treatments with salt, mud, and soap that are priced at $55 per person. They don't give couple massages, so don't even bother asking. Also, you'll be bare naked for all of the treatments so it can get into your skin and body. Massages are very good, but as my friend has learned, do not challenge the masseuse to give you the firmest massage ever. Especially don't say ""I mean it."" You will probably be hit in the head multiple times.The massage I got was the Platza Oak Leaf massage. This one was pretty unique in my experience. I like the hot and cold aspect of the whole thing because it easily cleared up my sinuses. The guy also does some back cracking moves that I feel has loosened my back nicely.The sauna rooms are pretty small (holding 8-10 people), but I really enjoy the old rustic European feeling of the whole thing.

I'm perfectly happy to go here for just one drink, and enjoy it slowly in a corner booth. Unfortunately, it's not possible to do that when this tiny joint is teeming with other sweaty east villagers, who are also in on the secret. The drinks are really fun, and super tastily crafted by very cool mixologists in costumes, who use floral and herbaceous infusions. For this reason, you really need a seat to enjoy this place.

Ordered two hamburgers with everything, half and half shake, and fries.Food was coming out smoothly from the kitchen until it stopped at one point. It got me worried that something was wrong and I would have to wait longer..but my buzzer rumbled and my ass was shaking (since I left it in my back pocket) and it was time to pick up my order.Sat down and chomped into my hamburger. The meat patty was pretty thin and a bit overcooked, but I was so hungry I didn't really care at that point. When I was eating the burger, I was thinking to myself this must be the worst Shake Shack out of all of them in the city (Battery Park being my favorite location) since the burger didn't taste up to par to what I've been used to at other locations in the city.  I really wished they kept the crinkle fries, but they are now thin hand-cut fries which wasn't too bad. Shake was thick and creamy.The person handling and managing the line came over to my table and asked if everything was okay, I replied saying that the patty was over cooked. He immediately asked what I ordered and if I want another fresh one since the one I have was not perfect. I accepted his offered and the new fresh burger was brought to my table within 10 minutes.New burger that was brought out tasted much better and it had some thickness to the meat patty and cooked medium well, perfect. SERVICE WAS AWESOME and everyone was very friendly. I can imagine this location will be the busiest out of any location in the nation since it's right in the middle of Grand Central Terminal. So if you have a train to catch in less than 20 minutes, I would not order from here.

838,7,7,4.0,"As a vegetarian, I usually don't get super excited when it comes to burger spots. A salad is a starter, NOT a meal. Most burger joints offer the same veggie patties you can buy frozen in the grocery store which I usually just pass on over a grilled cheese because they are 90% textured soy protein (not so tasty). Bareburger really surprised me with its abundance of vegetarian option! They have THREE different vegan patties: black bean, mushroom, and farmer's quinoa. For those of you that prefer meatier fare they've got pretty much every kind of meat you could ask for from beef to bison to ostrich. They also have a variety of buns, wraps, toppings and sauces. I love how most of the burgers on the menu come with avocado and some delicious special sauce! They are not skimpy with the sauce either. The fries are decent. The onion rings are GREAT. They have three different kinds of fried pickles on the menu! I love that! The milkshakes are awesome! The peanut butter one had a weird gritty texture that I wasn't a fan of, but others mention it being good so maybe I just got a bad batch?They have specialty sodas which look amazing but I have yet to order. Pretty decent beer selection too. This location is larger than meets the eye with a second floor. I love how the second floor has its own little bar so the beers flow easily. It's a little pricey for a burger place, but everything I had was quality and the service has been great! They've even let us bring in a cake from outside with no issues or extra charges.

I decided to go with the tofu edamame salad crepe, which came stuffed with tofu, spinach leaves, edamame, carrots, hard-boiled egg, green beans, and pistachio bits. I loved how there were plenty of tofu cubes and hard-boiled egg chunks - the ""meat"" of the salad. I also really liked how the pistachios added some crunchiness. One thing I didn't like, though, was the dressing/sauce. The menu description says ""Eight Turn sesame dressing"" and ""Eight Turn tofu sauce,"" but I didn't pick up any hint of sesame, and the sauce tasted too mayonnaise-y for me.The place itself is super tiny - there's the counter where you order, and then a very small counter in front of the window where there's standing room for about 2 people. It'd be nice if they added a stool or two.Also, be warned: if you're taking your crepe to eat on the go (which you probably will be, given the lack of seating), take plenty of napkins.

This not-so-common brunch cocktail will absolutely rock your taste buds unless you're allergic to clams... which in that case, it will rock your inner intestines. In this wondrous drink you have your typical base spirit and spices but then you add that magical ingredient: clamato. That's right, clam tomato juice. Then for good measure, the rim of the glass is usually lined with Old Bay Seasoning to make it even more addicting.Their version was also served with an oyster on the half-shell on top as well as a bacon-wrapped Brussels sprout. So zesty. So clammy. So freaking good it blows my mind. For my brunch entree, I basically ordered their Eggs Benedict with lobster instead of salmon... which they then charged me $26 for the dish. $8 extra for some claw meat? That seemed like a little too much for the amount of lobster I received on my plate (since come on, I could buy a whole lobster at many restaurants for that much money). Oh well. Although I was a little annoyed with the price, I can't argue with how good it tasted. Everything was so fresh and delicious. The scallion cream on my Benedict blew my mind after it was subsequently blown by my Bloody Caesar! Even the wheat toast with homemade jam was the bomb.Like most popular brunch places in Manhattan, this place can get a little crazy yo.

I wanted somewhere fancy, but also not too stuffy. Long tasting menus were out since grandma lacks the stamina. It was down to Bouley, Marea and Gotham. Against vague objections from Michael, I made the reservation at Marea, because we are a seafood family (Ningbo, holla). I'll keep this short and sweet since there are way more reviews than there is time to peruse them. The pastas were all good, but nothing was spectacular - I was most fond of my mom's octopus (incidentally, my aunt's octopus was also the best appetizer of the four - my crudo was pretty boring and I had a hard time eating it with a fork because I'm such a barbarian that I yearned for chopsticks.) Nothing topped the Trofie Nero at Ai Fiori. The bread selection was lackluster save for the foccacia which I really liked (and I don't even like olives!). We loved the strati di cioccolato, and the complimentary petit fours. Service was broken down to compartments, but never felt fussy. The needs of the table were anticipated in perfect time. All the moms in my group were sent home with a small box of chocolates.Just one note, I did realize what it was Michael was so iffy about when I chose Marea.

And since I hadn't been here since I was sixteen and working as a summer camp counselor, I rationalized the ticket fees were fine for some good ol' culturefication. The line almost scared me away. Then I noticed that you could purchase the tickets via computer, which was only a two minute wait. So with tickets in hand, we wandered inside. And immediately wished we had a map. I regretted my decision to come here. I just wanted to see the dinosaurs, then leave. For you see, while I enjoy museums, I don't have patience for them. I'm not one of those people who can stare an exhibit for five hours, thus spending his/her entire day wandering the halls. The tourists are also a huge turnoff. Tourists wandering the city streets with their thumbs up their butts drive me INSANE--especially when I am in a rush to catch the next train. Now dealing with those very same people, with their bratty, screaming kids, as they block every pathway through a building? I guess that explains my aversion. Then something magical happened: I saw this really cool scene in the African section and promptly went into author mode. RESEARCH, my mind screeched. It was the perfect scene for a dystopian. I also saw another scene that reminded me of GoT. The cynical, impatient part of me promptly took a backseat and was told to STFU so I could enjoy the sights. Some of the more modern animals were unimpressive, but the fourth floor, aka the dino area, remedied that quite nicely. We didn't see a T-rex, though. We wandered the fourth floor, back and forth, but nothing. I'm not sure what was up with that, but seeing all the other fossils kind of made up for that. I'd already seen a T-rex fossil when I was younger, but my mom, having never been here before, was disappointed when we didn't see it. I think we were there for a good hour and a half. After that, we were exhausted and ready to go home. We didn't see all of the exhibits, including the whale exhibit where you had to pay extra for. Oh well. Beware the shrieking children.",11,0.892
848,8,16,4.0,"6/30/13 - Second time's the charm. I ended up stopping by here on another Sunday morning. Since the last visit, the production scale has been bumped to 300-350 per day, and the limit per customer has dropped from 3 to 2. Both helped, considering by the time I got there (7:30am for a 9am Sunday opening), there were already 120+ people in line. EFFING RIDICULOUS.9AM: the girl behind me in line starts complaining to her boyfriend (standing right next to her) about relationship problems. Waiting in line for an extended period of time brings out the worst in us. 10AM: the line starts moving through staggered intervals - fire safety regulations and all that nonsense. One of the workers brings out fresh Madelines for customers to sample (generally handed out to the people in the back of the line) and I'm thinking ""goddammit I'm in trouble"".10:20 AM: I've finally left the outside line and entered the in-store line. Hooray!10:30 AM - Three hours later, I finally (and thankfully) had my Cronuts. Fried, crunchy exterior with a flaky pastry on the inside. There's also filling alternating in between layers. They rotate the flavors every month, and the last batch for this month happened to be lemon-maple. The first one I ate had way too much filling, to the extent that with each successive bite I had filling oozing out of the pastry. The second one was a lot more manageable. Final verdict? Pretty darn good, but not at all worth waiting three hours in line for. Personally, I feel the DKA is just as good, and you can get it without the insane wait (provided you come a couple hours after opening). I don't see the Cronut craze dying down anytime soon, but now with a limit of 2 per person, at least there will be a lot more satisfied customers.Only in New York City are there people that will wait three+ hours in line for food that isn't even free.",13,0.7578
849,12,9,4.0,"How can you not like this place? Chill vibe, great beer selection, amazing happy hour. The bartenders here are also extremely friendly. I've been to this place probably a little over 10 times within the last two months. Definitely, my new favorite bar.For those that don't know about their ingenious happy hour deal, everything on the menu is half price. It's half-price in the sense that you buy the first drink at full price but with every drink you buy they give you a voucher for another drink of equal or lesser value. The best part about their happy hour is that you can accumulate vouchers during happy hour and then use them even when happy hour is over. If you are smart about how you drink it's essentially happy hour all the time at this bar.They also have some pretty unique shots here. Their signature shot is the Rolo shot which basically tastes like chocolate milk with a splash of vodka. Don't be fooled by it's milk chocolatey taste. The shot itself is fairly strong. I've also tried another shot of theirs called brain damage which has so many components that I couldn't even begin to describe it to you except that it looks like gray matter oozing down into a lower level of clear reddish liquid which I assume is suppose to be cerebrospinal fluid.The only downside is that this place can get pretty packed during happy hour and the weekends, but the bartenders, at least, are pretty quick about getting your drinks.The owner and the bartenders are all from Eastern Europe and are all extremely friendly people. This really has that feel of a true neighborhood dive bar. They've been open since 2002 and judging from how popular they are I'm sure that they have at least another decade ahead of them.",12,0.9976
850,12,7,4.0,"Do you like homemade food? Yes, of course you do! Are you broke? Yes, of course you are! Well if you live nearby and need lunch, come here! Streecha is not a restaurant. It is a church basement where old eastern European ladies make homemade food and sell it extremely cheap. Don't expect anything in terms of frills, as there will be none. Almost everyone will be eastern European and you may feel like an outsider even though you will be welcome. But you can eat like a king at Streecha for $5. I got the stuffed cabbage, borsch and 4 pierogi with onions. Yes that is a lot of food, but believe it or not I made it work. As others have noted, the borsch comes in either a styrofoam cup or bowl. I got just a cup, and it was actually pretty good! Much better than some versions I've had in restaurants nearby, and for $1.50 you can't beat the price. I was leery of the potato pierogi as they contain cheddar cheese, but luckily this is mixed into the potato; you can see it by the potato's coloring and taste it, but it's not overwhelming. I often find potato piergoi absolutely boring based on their lack of spices, but in this case the cheese helped a lot. With some carmelized-to-death onions on top, they hit the spot. The best for me though was the stuffed cabbage. It was more rice than meat as you could expect ($3), but there was so much right about it. The rice/pork mixture was nicely spiced, and contrasted well with the carmelized cabbage that held it together. Yes, the best term I have to describe the cabbage is carmelized. It was a little greasy, but this is one of the better stuffed cabbage versions I've had in terms of flavor. For $6.50 total, this was epic. They had no donuts when I was there--just some honey cake thing--but I will be back now that I know they make them. For what this place is, it's a one-of-a-kind look at the past of the East Village's old Polish-Ukrainian community. Add that sociological perspective with cheap, great food and this place is a must-visit in the East Village. I'm already planning my next trip.",14,0.995

852,14,12,4.0,"""The Boil"" is a new-ish (less than a year old) seafood spot that opened up on the outer borders of Chinatown and the Lower East Side. I watched the restaurant go from an empty storefront to this surprisingly sophisticated yet informal setting. The mood in ""The Boil"" is one part seafood boil/newspapers on the table joint (though in this case it's big brown butcher paper) and one part bar/night spot. Modern music plays in the background at just the right volume as the dim lighting and wood work together to create a welcoming environment. Everyone we met on the staff was friendly and patient.Now, a few things you need to know before even thinking of coming here:1. CASH ONLY. Ther doesn't appear to be any movement towards accepting cards, to the point where an ATM machine is installed in one corner (a $2 fee). This, perhaps, is the place's biggest weakness as sometimes I'm more than willing to splurge on a card but may not have brought enough cash to get everything I want. I wind up saving money this way, but it's hardly a money making proposition, especially where the bar is concerned.2. NO reservations. You show up, you put your name down and that's it - your entire party has to be there before you're seated.3. You will get messy! Before you eat, you are provided with a bib and rubber gloves. Yes, rubber gloves, like the ones you wear when you're painting. Your food is served in (I kid you not) a plastic bag which you pick through to get your food. This is actually quite fun and nowhere near as gross as it may sound.If you're good with the above, you're ready to have a great time here. Our waitress was an amazingly friendly young lady and although there was a huge crowd waiting outside, we never ever felt rushed. We were told to enjoy ourselves and not worry abou tthe crowds, something I'm definitely not used to at most restaurants! My girlfriend and I ordered a combination ""bag"". This included a half pound of dungeness crab and a half pound of crawfish. We asked for a mild version of the ""Boil Sauce"", an amazing combination that involves butter, garlic, love and I'm convinced: addictive drugs. This stuff was amazing. Salty, sweet, creamy enough to coat the meat of the crab and crawfish (and shrimp provided by my friends). Included was a small piece of corn, several pieces of potatoes and sausage, adding to the flavor extravaganze. I'm normally not a big fan of picking shells apart to get to my meat, but tonight I made an exception as everything was so incredibly delicious I didn't even notice (the awesome company of friends like Tom K. and Elaine M. helped!)I loved The Boil and I'm already making plans to go back within the week.

On charming Elizabeth street serving up New Zealand cuisine from chef Matt Lambert of Saxon + Parole, this is a perfect date spot. The long walnut bar is a great spot to catch up after work this summer and throw back something cold, and may I recommend the Scorsese, a rye whiskey concoction with egg whites and bitters. The bartenders here are always smiling and the leather coasters were a nice touch as well. I have yet to eat here so I cannot judge the dinner menu, but the room in the back is inviting with windows overlooking a garden area. The front has sexy leather banquette booths opposite the bar. Both perfectly suitable for date night. I can't wait to come back and try the seared foie gras with apricots and mandarin or the Quail with cherries and bread sauce.

The puree(tre-French) was a good summer soup. The corn was not as crisp as I would have expected but it was a flavorful combo. The bread basket includes a chestnut bread, yellow in color with turmeric that tastes slightly sweet & is very exotic. For dessert I had a lemon/milk chocolate cookie which tasted more Madeline, than cookie, but delish nonetheless. Hot chocolate was straight outta France & great to see real hot chocolate, not the watered down crap you see in most spots. Service was very French & friendly, my waitress hailed from France.

855,9,2,4.0,"The Jazz Lounge is located under the main restaurant and has a very old world New York in the golden days vibe. Ferns, sultry wallpaper, and large curved booths all encircle a very intimate stage with live music sets all night long. The band was AWESOME, the main guy, was such a crowd-pleaser coming down off the stage and crawling up the furniture as he was filled with the spirit of his toe tappin' melody. He brought the energy of the room up to 10 as soon as he got behind the mic. The band backing him up was huge. How many people can you fit on a tiny stage? Well I don't know, but each and every one of their instruments sounded great. Individually during their little solos, and triumphant blasting out all together as vibrant beautiful noise. We dined on pretty much everything off the lounge menu, which I think was the same menu as upstairs. The ridiculously large sushi boat was delicious, but perhaps not a practical item to order as you are eating at tiny cafe bistro sized tables. The guy who brought out the boat was in a rush to set it down, as it did look pretty heavy! He ended up knocking a full glass of water into my dates lap, pretty much spoiling the rest of his night sadly. They comped us a beer but I felt they could have done more as he was also drinking high end scotch, and we were ordering so much... the waitresses were nice enough but I felt that the organization in the downstairs area needs to be ironed out a bit, we were approached by many staff members with little continuity and consistency of service. The pacing of bringing out the food was non existent and pretty ludacris for them to attempt to do for such a tiny table. It was like a full on African Stampede, sushi boat, tiger shrimps, miso cods, man grating wasabi table side, more entrees, etc etc... ALL AT ONCE, cue the loud band behind, it was really like a wild improvisational skat shoooobidity bop bop experience to see the servers all flitting about insanely for 5 mins... then us, spinning plates, balancing hot skillets, steering the sushi boat left right, ahh no space.

856,5,10,4.0,"Super interesting crowd and old-school atmosphere. Came to Sparks with a group of clients, who happened to be mostly female. It's like the doorman had never seen a woman walk through those steakhouse doors before. They were going absolutely ballistic, sweeping us over to the bar and pouring wine for us with a sense of absolute urgency. I looked around, and noticed that nobody there was under the age of 55 - a lot of suits, a lot of bald heads.We went to take our table, and as we walked by, someone commented ""Should I ask who's getting married?"" (ie, the only reason so many chicks would come to this place is if they're at a bachelorette.) It was kind of crazy, but didn't really bother me, as the novelty value was off the charts. Old paintings on the walls, white tablecloths, mafioso-esque staff. This place was not messing around when it came to keeping up a nostalgic atmosphere.Drink service was slow initially, and this is not the place to order any type of custom cocktail - whiskey - rocks, or a bottle of red. Once we got our first round, we started in on ordering...everything on the menu, in typical steakhouse fashion. Fried clams, mozzarella salad, asparagus, creamed spinach..the list goes on. It was all decent, nothing stood out as tremendously unique or even remotely different from what you'd get at one of the dozens of other steakhouses in NYC. However, the steaks were definitely quite the production. They come out on an old wooden cart, and are the approximate size of your head. Absolutely massive. None of us could get through our order, and everyone took over tons of leftovers for extra-bougie steak salads the next day. We stayed for 3 hours and weren't rushed in any way, which I appreciated. If you're looking for a super-old school vibe and extra-expensive spot to celebrate in a carnivorous way, I'd recommend it.",12,0.9787

The prices and atmosphere are comparable to any other Chinese restaurant around (but then again, who goes to Chinese for ambiance?).

Whether its gloppy brown sauce or fried items swimming in grease, they just always seem to miss the mark. But I can honestly say that Golden Fountain never makes those mistakes.

859,7,5,4.0,"To those who have never watched Saturday Night Fever, or who are unfamiliar with it, the movie may simply be ""that disco movie"" with John Travolta in it. But it is actually about so much more than disco, which really only served as the backdrop of what it was trying to portray. Set in the 1970s, the movie tells the story of Tony Manero, a young man living in the Bay Ridge neighbourhood. Stuck in a low-paying job and undermined by his parents at home, the only time Tony felt like he could be somebody was when he was on the dance floor. Saturday Night Fever touched upon the social mores and tension of 1970s New York City, visiting subjects like racial conflicts, rape, drugs, abortion, and suicide. Seemingly happy living in Bay Ridge, it wasn't until Tony met Stephanie Mangano that he slowly realised he felt trapped and that he wanted to leave Bay Ridge for the concrete towers of Manhattan just like Stephanie did. Stephanie desperately wanted out of the ""Bay Ridge scene"".These days, Bay Ridge is no longer a predominantly Italian neighbourhood as portrayed in Saturday Night Fever. It has a diverse ethnic mix of people, including the Chinese. This is where Sundaes and Cones got its start. But following Tony Manero and Stephanie Mangano's footsteps, this ice cream parlour also moved to Manhattan. It moved to East Village, to be precise. On my second or third visit, I realised that all of the people behind the counter at this ice cream parlour were young Asian people. I asked one of them why that is, and he said that the establishment is a family business. Well that certainly explains some of the Asian-inspired ice cream flavours like ginger, taro, and black sesame. Their ice cream is truly delicious and on most late summer nights, there are groups of people inside ordering ice cream, and outside eating the ice cream they just ordered. My favourite so far is the salted caramel on a sugar cone. Sundaes and Cones also makes ice cream cakes and serve shakes. I have not tried either but I would not be surprised if they were equally delicious.",9,0.4499

861,8,7,4.0,"Summary: Great for groups and a nice spot if you don't want to trek it to Queens or Chinatown. Mid-range Chinese food alternative. Reasonably priced vs. other non-dive mid-town Chinese food places. Four stars for BYOB sans corkage fee.Atmosphere: It looks like a Chinese New Years decoration store exploded inside here. The restaurant is located in the downstairs of the building. It's very clean and darkly light without being too dark. While I think most will find the various luck symbols to be a nice touch to Asian-ize an otherwise, green windowless space, for Chinese folks may instead feel like they stepped into year around Chinese New Years. Wow... that's a lot of luck being symbolized on the walls.Service: I'm going to give it a four, but honestly, there were times when it was a bit confusing to me. We had a party of 6 that arrived over the course of a 1/2 hour and ran up against their closing time. In all fairness, I think that may have been part of the confusion. They classically will want you to order everything all at once, vs. Western tradition of apps first then main course. There were three main oddities which included: pouring water for one person, but not for everyone who had no water, bringing a single hot sauce for 1 person when everyone at the table was requesting, and some very unconventional use of plates. We started with 2 plates each, 1 was cleared then half of us got 2 plates at a time while some only had 1. After the initial oddity, though, things started to normalize. They started to bring more condiments and also just swapped out plates in the normal custom. Food: The food was good, but surprisingly, it wasn't all of the classically Cantonese dishes. Salt & Pepper Squid or Shrimp. We had both. The chef really excels at salt pepper dishes. As the name suggests, this is breaded slightly thicker than tempura with salt and pepper. 5 stars.Beef Chow Fun - This is the Gan Chow Ngow Haw (flat noodles) and is one of the better in the city. Great with the hot sauce. 5 StarsSoy Garlic Chicken. Surprisingly delicious, this lightly fried chicken dish was a so good we ordered 2. 5 starsSoft Shell Crab with Soy - Solidly executed. The underbelly is separated for those that like that, thus making the bitterness not permeate into legs. 4.5 stars for execution.Chicken with salted fish fried rice. Well executed. Worth a try. Mustard Greens. Surprisingly this was the stalk instead of the leaves. After our initial confusion, we dove in and found it delightful. 5 stars.Sea Bass with Ginger & Scallions - Fresh enough, but the point of this dish is for the steamed mixture of ginger, scallion and soy to magically infuse a gentle essence of flavor into the fish so that a light pouring of sauce brings it all out. The fish stayed fish and the sauce wasn't enough to bring it home. 3 stars.Ginger & Scallion Lobster - Fresh and executed, but not an amazing execution. There was an actual sauce on the plate... odd. If you're craving it, go ahead. That said, I'd save this for China town.For my crustaceans list, 3.5 stars, because it saves me the trek to Chinatown. For general overall 4 stars.

862,21,15,4.0,"MMD, what's a nice restaurant like you doing at an address like this?1149 First Avenue. It's been home to many Indian restaurants in the past - Baluchi and Bawarchi being 2 prior tenants in the 5 years prior to Moti Mahal Delux (MMD)'s incarnation. However, instead of being haunted by the ghosts of restaurants past, MMD, is able to charge prices that would be 20-25% less than what you'd pay for an Indian restaurant in Mid Town East - partly due to cheaper real estate.Speaking of prices, I don't understand those who whine about MMD being expensive. Seriously, just because the cuisine is Indian, does that mean that a meal SHOULD cost less than $ 20 per person? Do the whiners understand that quality of ingredients, and uniqueness of preparation, result in higher costs - and thus actually merit higher prices? Or do they think that just because the restaurant has ""Mahal"" in its name, they should pay the same prices that they did for that pathetic Indian restaurant of their college years, likely one that had Taj, Mahal, India, or Curry (if not Hurry) in its name?Saffron. It might well be the most expensive food in the world (good saffron ranges between $ 2,500-7,500 per pound, depending upon origin). Quality saffron is used by chefs in the Indian subcontinent when they want to impress the guests - sparing no expense in doing so. Saffron, is the secret ingredient in MMD's famous Dal Makhani, a dish so well executed that NY Times described it as ""a bowl of lentils (that) can make you go wobbly with happiness"". Despite dedicating two paragraphs to it, Pete Wells wasn't able to identify the starring turn of saffron -instead focusing simply on the ocean of butter that the lentils has absorbed.Now I didn't try their ""signature"" Tandoori chicken (apparently reason alone for the owner to acquire this Indian Franchise), for I never eat Saag Paneer, Chicken Tikka Massala or Tandoori chicken at an Indian restaurant - pet crutches of the food critic who doesn't understand Indian cuisine. In fact, should you find a review of these in my reviews, please do alert yelp HQ that my account has been hacked... as there could be no other reason. But, I did try enough chicken dishes in the menu to realize that the kitchen converts a pollo into Apollo! Starting from the clay oven dishes (Anardana Tikka: chicken with black pepper, pomegranate marinade; Cream Murgh Tikka: cardamom, cream cheese marinade) to the Kadhai Murgh in the entrees, they are all superior executions. I've also liked the Mutton Tawa Tikka (grilled mutton cubes, finished on the griddle). However, I can't say that I'm a fan of the spiced okra, or of the Biryani (despite the grains of rice not being clumpy, but distinct - as they should be) that was, to be polite, bland. I do think their vegetarian executions lack those for chicken, but not every Indian restaurant in the city excels at vegetarian - the way the cuisine should, per potential.Unlike the NY Times' view, I didn't think that the desserts were a waste. The first time I tried it I really liked the Ras Malai, however the next time around, I thought the consistency of the cream was lacking. Instead, I much prefer the Phirni (rice pudding with raisins) that has to be amongst the better versions in its class, and much denser than comparative interpretations.Service is competent, but not exceptional as at Tulsi. The comparison is relevant as the manager at Tulsi was prompt to greet me with ""nice to see you again"" on my 2nd visit, while my 4 visits to MMD in 2 weeks led to no such recognition in any of my visits. That said, I'll live with the price / value proposition of MMD any time over that of Tulsi. (4.5 stars)",28,0.9732

I was afraid all the hype would leave me disappointed but I've actually never been more wrong in my life! The food was perfect!Between 3 girls, we split creamy polenta, the spaghetti, the duck and foie gras ravioli and black cod.Although I am not a fan of mushrooms at all, I forced myself to try the creamy polenta. Unsurprisingly I still did not enjoy the taste of the mushroom sauce, but the polenta was very creamy.The spaghetti was my absolute favorite of the night. I know you're probably thinking ""how good can plain ol' spaghetti really be'? I for sure thought that as well, but this spaghetti was perfectly al dente, wrapped in a light blanket of spicy tomato sauce with fresh bits of basil mixed in. Apparently this is the pasta Scott Conant made to woo his lady friends in college. Consider me wooed.Not to dote on just the spaghetti, the duck and foie gras raviolis were equally delightful - smooth, rich and perfectly salty.I cannot rave more about this place...except that the service was ridiculous fast...perhaps a bit toooo fast. I felt it lacked that Italian homey feel where you're welcomed to stay for longer than you should.All in all, a perfect place for some ridiculously good pasta!! All hail the king of pasta!",4,0.9946

I also tried the sheep's milk gnudi, with its creamy buttery sauce with of course fried sage..Why didn't I think of frying all these herbs...ugh so good. The seared mackerel was delicious too, not stinky and just perfectly salted.The food here is just surprisingly awesome with such a down to earth setting. Plenty of drinks to choose from.

868,11,15,4.0,"Dear Mr. Payard, Did you really have to go ahead and open a bakery not 3 minutes walking distance from my home?Bad, bad Mr. Payard. No macaron for you. Because I already ate them all.Kthanks,Madhuri---A few weeks ago I resolved to eat healthy. A few weeks ago I also decided to be better about catching up with friends. And a few weeks ago, I resolved not to patronize Starbucks a lot, since I don't love their products so much anyway. These three resolutions don't work so well, as I end up meeting a lot of my friends over pastries at FPB. It's not hard to guess which resolution I am completely ignoring.As a patisserie I think this is quite excellent. Among my favourites here are the macarons (I recommend the Salted Caramel and the Rosemary Apricot ones) and the Chocolate Chiboust tart (you'll love the candied nuts and caramel and chocolate even though I've had better tart bases). On summer days, their fruit tarts are lovely too. I thought their eclair and their roulades were strictly okay, I won't be ordering that another time.I have had less luck with their savoury creations - their baguettes are good but not great, and the quiche was quite dry the one time that I tried it. The hot chocolate is something that I thought would be beyond all expectations, but in general I found it too creamy and not sweet enough, and served in a cup twice the size of what should have been. Their overall drink selection is quite basic, though I am glad to note that more recently they have added some cider and herbal teas. The service is patchy - some of the employees are really friendly, others not so much.For me, coming into FPB for a quick dessert has become almost too easy to do, though the best things at FPB can be taken out and eaten in the comfort of your home.",12,0.9821
869,10,12,4.0,"Love this lounge. It was rather loud on a Saturday night. Good thing we made a reservation because it was packed, esp the bar.We were seated at a table near the bar and everyone started putting their arms on the handrails next to our table. I saw all sorts of arms resting on the hand rails. I saw one very hairy arm, looked up and almost screamed when I realized that it belonged to a woman instead of a chimpanzee. Oh the horror. The only reason I didn't scream was because I was drinking my Velvet Breeze, a wonderful vodka-based cocktail with grapefruit and lime, which helped calm my nerves.My friend had the Beijing Mule which came with an orchid. Our waitress kept coming back to ask us if we wanted seconds. Calm down, lady.The cocktails were delicious, can't wait to come back.",11,0.9685
870,12,12,4.0,"I'm upping the rating from my last review. I don't care if it's overpriced--we tried maybe 7 things off their menu and all were terrific. Highlights for me were the beef sliders--the beef topped with kimchi pickles--and the spicy whelk salad w. buckwheat noodles, aka the ""golbaengi moochim w. bibim soba gooksoo"". I could do without the whelk (sea snail) itself, but the rest of it was delish, and also I greatly enjoyed saying ""golbaengi moochim w. bibim soba gooksoo"". In fact, I propose Danji offers a discount special: if you are not Korean and you can say ""golbaengi moochim w. bibim soba gooksoo"" ten times fast, you get it for free. The yellowtail sashimi was also tops.There were a few disappointments, but they were minor. The kimchi trio looked better than it was--it's not that the kimchi was bad, just that I've had better and its flavor was very mild. Also, no dessert! (You can use this as an opportunity, though: Casselula and Taboon down the street have lovely desserts.)The drinks were good: I had the 5-2 aka the O-ee, a cool cucumber-gin drink perfect for a hot day. My partner in crime tonight had the sangria, which I tried and liked because it tasted like it was sweetened only with fruit, so it was very mellow, not overly sweet.Other notes:- Sitting at the bar is fun if you can get in there. - The acoustics are crummy. It gets pretty loud.- I got here at 6 because I like to pretend I am a grandparent, but this place got busy by 6:45 and I noticed them turn some people away. Consider coming early.",13,0.993
871,25,24,4.0,"Recession special of a couple of tasty dogs and a drink is a NYC institution. Gotta love hot dogs that snap! Every once in a while while walking the city streets you just get a hankering for something to eat. This is the quintessential quick bite meal. Just a small standing room window counter to hunker down and munch out on your beefy hot dog feast. Open all night and pretty much every day of the year. I have stumbled into this spot and a few of their other locations after a night (or afternoon) of drinking to fill my belly. I thinks it's that intoxicating aroma of hot dog that wafts into your nose as you walk by that lures you in.Fast, cash only, efficient, and delish! It gets the job done. Less than $5 and you have a meal. So much better than a dirty water dog cart, and way better than Nathan's. I do feel that Papaya King on the UES is a smidge better, but since I live up there I am biased. Gotta rep my hood! Honestly, I don't care what's in these things, even if it kills me.

872,12,12,4.0,"There are Thai restaurants and there are good Thai restaurants in the over-saturated theater district. Much to my delight, Breeze fits in the latter category.If you've been to the Theater District/Hell's Kitchen area, you will quickly discover that there are no shortage of Thai restaurants. It seems like every block on 9th avenue between 42nd and 57th streets features at least one example of Thai cuisine. Of course, not all places are created equal. But what I like about Breeze is how they seamlessly blend elements of Western/French cooking with traditional Thai dishes. From a balance perspective, it seems like this place is more like 60/40 in favor of the West, but that doesn't mean it's not a great place to eat.I've had the Asian sandwich, which tries to be their take on the Bahn Mi sandwich. The taste is decent though honestly it wasn't incredibly memorable. But their entrees are a different story. The fried shrimp entree is terrific, with ample flavor and portions. The duck entree is very tasty, with a zesty sauce and nice trimmings. The breeze tuna tartare appetizer is also fantastic, along with the obligatory spring rolls and summer rolls.As for dessert, the fried ice cream was nice and the flames were a nice touch. Sort of reminds me of a flaming moe's being served ice cream style.",15,0.9807
873,14,13,4.0,"In a city like New York inhabited by so many ramen giants supported by all their little ramen minions, I'd imagine that it'd be pretty hard for any lesser known shop to carve out its own niche. However, right off of 125th st, Jin Ramen has quietly and deservedly found its own local following and while it may not be a powerhouse just yet, it's a welcome breath of fresh ramen air to the upper westside.You'll immediately notice that Jin Ramen is slightly hidden off the subway stop but there is usually a line of people waiting outside. Space is scarce and lighting is pretty dark but the line moves quickly so a 20 minute wait may be quicker than you think. Before we get to food, I'll just say service is good. The waitstaff is friendly and fairly attentive to your needs. When it gets really busy it can be difficult to flag someone down but that's a small annoyance. On to the food . . . Appetizers are so so good but so so expensive. My friends and I have ordered the Kara-Age (Boneless Fried Chicken) and the Steamed Pork Buns which are both phenomenal. The Kara-Age is very tender and lightly breaded while the chasu pork is a perfect balance of leaner meat and fat. Both are served with some sort of slaw that is equally just as amazing both by itself or coupled with the chicken/pork buns. Like I said, it is a little pricey but it's a hard temptation to resist. The ramen is preeetty good but definitely not the most amazing dish you've ever had. For my tastes, the noodles are a little too firm but the broth is definitely very rich, especially the Spicy Tonkatsu. My friend likes to get the miso but I really don't see why he likes it so much but if you're a fan of miso ramen, perhaps Jin Ramen's will tickle your senses. The other day, I had a huge Jin Ramen Revelation. I flipped over the menu and realized that they have rice dishes that are not only cheaper, but AMAZING. I can't remember the name of the one I got but they all looked good so if you're feeling a little sick of ramen or want a well cooked japanese rice dish, try it out. Thankfully, they're pretty generous with the ingredients to rice ratio.Overall, Jin Ramen is a decent spot for ramen but what gives it its charm is the atmosphere and the people who work there. Everyone is very friendly and accommodating and while the small space can feel cramped, it admittedly adds a sense of endearment to the entire place. Food isn't the best but the prices reflect that and aren't outrageously high (except for the appetizers . . . kinda). So if you're in the area and looking for a new place to get ramen or a nice japanese rice bowl, definitely be sure to hit up Jin Ramen.",20,0.9989
874,9,12,4.0,"Going out in Soho often ends up badly for me. If we don't end up at a creepy dive bar or an achingly hip place where the guys spend hours grooming their beards to look like they did not groom their beards, we end up at a lounge smaller than my apartment with a humiliating door policy and a terrifying table minimum.Enter Brinkley's on Broome Street. I must admit I was hesitant at first. This is because my friend who suggested the place (and goes so often that he practically pays the electric bill) has monogrammed luggage. Not a good sign. However, I was proved wrong. I have now been a couple of times and I definitely like the place. It looks and feels like a turn of the last century corner saloon / tavern, without the ""we are trying to recreate an early 1900's saloon"". That gets annoying. The bar area is a fairly large room, has high ceilings and a long bar, so it is relatively easy to get drinks. You don't feel overly cramped even when it is crowded. We went on a Saturday night, so it was crowded with a small line outside. Good music was playing on the stereo. The scene was very lively, and was comprised of a mildly upscale, young crowd, but not in an obnoxious, immature, keg-standing sort of way.  This is definitely a good go to spot in Soho if you want to have a good time and don't want to be humiliated by a door policy, or hang out with people sporting the ""distressed longshoreman"" look.",14,-0.3516
875,4,3,4.0,"I could literally throw something out my apartment window and hit this bar, so of course when it opened up, the wife and I had to go check it out. W 26th Street between 6th Ave and Broadway has become a nice block to find quality bars with both good drinks and food (and minus the Jersey Shore crowd you'll find at some other places a few blocks away). Maysville and Flatiron Room come specifically to mind if you're a whisky lover. I'd say Flatiron Hall is a notch below those two, but it's a quality choice with a different atmosphere. This place definitely has more of a retro feel to it, and if you're a beer person, this is probably the right choice for you. It was opened by the same guy who owns Heartland Brewery, but it doesn't have the same touristy feel to it.To start with the drinks, they had a nice selection of house beers available. I'm more a spirits guy, so I went with something off their cocktail menu. The Jack's Apple sounded promising with brandy, moonshine, and sourmash. It came in a martini glass with a cherry and looked like a girl's drink, so that earned me some mockery from my wife. It tasted pretty good though and was plenty strong. My wife got a glass of riesling which she seemed fine with. I'll probably go for something off the beer menu on my next visit though.For food items, we ordered the following:Giant Pretzel - This was really a GIANT pretzel. I'll post a picture for reference later, but it should probably be shared between four people. The pretzel was great, with a nice crust and perfectly chewy on the inside. I wasn't a huge fan of the cheddar ale dip, but mostly because I prefer mustard to something cheesy to go with my pretzels.Maui Fish Tacos - These are hard shell tacos, which I am a fan of, but I know not everyone is. Cod was cooked nicely with a tasty mango salsa and a lime mayo. The most important thing for me with fish tacos is that the fish isn't overcooked, and these seemed to be cooked just right.Bacon & Chicken Mac n' Cheese - Ummm yeah, of course I'm ordering the dish with cheese and bacon. It was prepared well with a nice cracker crust and included the promised bacon, chicken, and scallions (raw on top). I don't know if I'd order this again for myself, only because a giant dish of mac n' cheese as a meal is a bit gluttonous even for me. I'd be open to sharing it with others though. Also, I feel obligated to point out that this mac n' cheese isn't nearly as good as what my wife makes at home.Nutella Panini (Dessert) - I could live without this again. There wasn't anything wrong with it, but it's just brioche with nutella and a side of nutella dipping sauce. Total damage came out to about $90 all-in, which is probably a little on the expensive side. We (or more accurately I) definitely over-ordered though, so I imagine subsequent visits will be a little less expensive.",14,0.9969

No one in their right mind is going to critique the urgings of a guy wearing that much leather, but: Seriously, sir? Let's assume that you're not from around here. Here's how to improve your Katz's experience: * Do not order anything you can get in your hometown diner. We have a local delicacy, and it's called pastrami. That's what you want. (Unless you're a vegetarian. Then you are allowed to order fries. But I'm guessing you're not a vegetarian.) * Do not announce that the prices shock you. Katz's pastrami sandwich is one of the finest culinary treasures on Earth. Plus, it can feed two people, even big, scary people such as yourself. And it comes with lots of pickles, making this a nutritionally balanced meal.* Push your way (nicely!) past the tourists near the front and find the lonely-looking cutter at the end of the sandwich section. Put a couple singles in his tip jar and enjoy the moist and delicious tidbits he'll lay out for you. And don't mess with him--that knife is sharp.* Do not get all sniffy because the place is a dump. Don't whine about the crazy, Soviet-style ordering system. The unspoken rules. The brusqueness. It's all part of Katz's ancient iconography, their very essence. Of course the place is a dump!

I wished the traditional takoyaki with the octopus filling didn't cost a extra $2.Aside from the Traditional balls that come with the original bonito flakes and seaweed, the other fillings you choose will be topped with corn flakes. At first when I saw this, I was like WTF..why are they putting corn flakes on top of my balls?! It's not a breakfast time is it..?

To stay on my feet, I proposed a trip to Corner Bistro, perhaps the longest-bookmarked place in my mind (and on Yelp) that I'd yet to visit. That West 4th location is really deceiving on paper. Let's face it, you'll be marching into the labyrinthine web of streets called the West Village for what seems like a 12 am eternity before arriving at Jane and 4th.But once there, I was surprised at how chill and unassuming the place was. For all its legendary burger write-ups and the How I Met Your Mother mention, I really expected to walk into a crammed $hit-$how of a tavern and eat standing up, like a horse, the cow fat dripping off my lips onto some girl's dress while a group of bros shoved me aside obliviously. No such misfortune befell us--Corner Bistro is a friendly neighborhood bar and grill, about medium-sized. The friendly, bearded bartender quickly took our orders and brought them out even quicker. That burger (mine was Bistro and medium-rare) really was juicy and delicious, and I would short-list it for best burger in NYC. The fries were pretty good, too.

My husband and I came here for dinner and we got one of those cute booth. There is a maki roll conveyor belt going around the seats to deliver fresh maki rolls with fusion flavors. Each color plate corresponds to a different price. We tried the avocado, snow crab and eel with cream cheese roll. There are 4 pieces in a roll so the price is not cheap. I love the combination though. Their dipping sauce in addition to your typical soy sauce is also well thought out. There is hot jalapeno pickles, chipotle sauce and a jalapeno sauce. We also had the Shrimp Tempura with Chile Piquin roll and it is very delicious. We were so ambitious we got another roll of mango and avocado with shrimp. We were pretty satisfied by then. But of course, we don't just stop at being satisfied, do we? We followed the rolls with another Rib Eye Tacos. It is $20 a plate so it is not your typical taco price. It is more like a wrap cut into many sections. The rib eye is so tender and juicy and I don't know what sauce they use but it is amazing! I did that in the chipotle sauce with the jalapeno pickles. Super yum! Of course, we also had to try the Garces Mexican style sushi roll. It has sliced jalapeno rolled over Manchego cheese, shrimp and different sauces. It is pretty good and filling.

While we waited for more friends to arrive, the Boy and I ordered the guac which was spicy and excellent and then the manchego croquettes with jalapeno, which I thought were quite tasty but he thought were too cheesy. I had the Yerba Benedict, which is excellent but super filling (especially with all those snacks and Cava beforehand... oops!) It is done on sweet corn cake with Serrano ham and Yerba's hollandaise, making it truly out of this world. The Boy had the Cuban Sandwich, which luckily he let me try before he devoured it. It was also excellent and he said ""one of the best he's ever had in NYC"" Whoa! We also had crispy bacon, which was OK but not so crispy. The others had the burger and the french toast, which seemed to be tasty as well as everyone in our crew was inhaling their food.The atmosphere here is fun and definitely ideal for a relaxing boozy brunch with a crew.

Any place that leaves me in happy, drunk, and in a total food coma on a Sunday is doing something well in my book! Thank you Yerba, we will see each other yet again!",15,0.9984
888,14,8,4.0,"Who are Otto Dix, George Grosz and Max Beckmann? Most people are probably not familiar with the above German artists, but they are my favorite painters since I was in high school. Fascinated by the WWII and the Great Depression stories behind their paintings, I became passionate in German art and the history of the Weimar Republic and even thought of doing a pHD in art history. Although I became a hipster instead of an art historian, I am amazed by the collection of art in the Neue Galerie, which are small yet powerful. While Neue Galerie is much smaller than the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, the former has some of the best work of the 20s and the 30s, such as Otto Dix's Portrait of the Journalist. However, as a sculptor, I would love to see work other than painting in the museum.Without doubt, Neue Galerie is my favorite gallery in New York. It not only reminds me of my nerdiness and passion in German art, but also reminds us to avoid World Wars that were depicted in the artwork.",15,0.9872
889,12,7,4.0,"I ventured away from my usual few lunch spots the other day and found Kori. Since I'm in Chinatown, it's nice to get Korean food once in a while and deviate from the usual Chinese food... so I was really happy to have found Kori to mix up my lunching patterns a bit! Also neat place to check out for dinner, without trekking up to K-town.The entrance is quite small and really easy to pass. I like the ambiance here, very romantic and modern... very Tribeca... which is what I like. Although the restaurant is very narrow, there is a tiny bar area with a decent happy hour and you also can sit comfortably and will not feel cramped in the dining area. They lined up pretty candles to set the mood. I didn't try any of the drinks, but there are a lot of dishes to try, and I think the sizes are quite decent. You also have the option to get brown or white rice. The prices for lunch were cheap for the area. The food is also very quick and perfect for lunch time! Overall this is a pretty decent place to grab a bite. It's not super expensive for the area and also has good quality food with ample portions.",14,0.9792

891,17,10,4.0,"***REVIEW FOR POOL***When I kicked off the project of trying to review every single pool and body of water in NYC, one of the first things I tried to do was get a free swim in a slew of fancy health clubs. It worked just about everywhere except for this place. The phonecall is still fresh on my mind. The agent informed me that a trial swim would cost 50 bucks, but that I could then apply that fee to my eventual membership, because surely I'd want to join for probably 500 bucks a month...Three years after that phonecall, I was presented with the unlikely opportunity to finally swim here - for free, thankyouverymuch. Ironically (or apporopriately?), this happened at a time when I was coming off of a year of unemployment, and was so in the hole that Team New York Aquatics (TNYA, best Masters swim team in all NYC!!) granted me a scholarship to work out with them. I usually swim with the team at John Jay, but got an email last week saying that the College was renovating its pool during spring break, and that we'd have to therefore have the dreadful inconvenience of dropping in on an alternative location. One of the alternative locations posed was the pool at Chelsea Piers, and I couldn't believe my eyes. Turns out that TNYA let the team at Chelsea Piers crash their sessions back when Hurricane Sandy wrecked all waterfronts. So, they were pulling through now to absorb our team members while John Jay got a facelift.Well, I signed up for two sessions as fast as my fingers could fly over the keyboard, and got into both! So Tuesday and Wednesday evening of this week found me taking the oddly peaceful ride on the 14D crosstown bus on 14th, which pretty much dropped me off right across the street of Pier 59. Avoiding the occasional hyphy towncar or supercharged jogger, I made it to Pier 60, then entered into the parking garage as instructed. A guy at the information booth told me to just go alll the way back. And when I did, I found a plain entrance to a lobby with non-working elevators, then hiked two stories up an industrial staircase to the front desk, beyond which a few guys with terrycloth headbands sat slumped in a fancy dining area and a few people slaved away on elilpticals. A portion of a red rubber indoor track was also visible, but I couldn't see where the path led as people quietly flitted by.Now, I'll cut straight to the chase and lay down what everyone wants to know.POSSIBLY WORTH THE MONEY IF YOU WANTED TO SPEND IT ON MEMBERSHIP:*A sense of uncrowded quiet*A sense of luxury that emanates from spotlessness rather than pretentiousness*Incredible amenities, including full length wooden door lockers, a crystal clear water bubbler attached to a shiny, deep silver faucet devoid of hair, spit, or gum, stone floor private showers that go in so deep that you can hang up your complimentary towel and cotton waffle robe without getting it wet... free flowing lotion, mint shampoo, repairing conditioner, green tea body wash...cotton swabs, cotton balls, salon grade hair dryers, and even sanitized combs...empty steam room and sauna, swimsuit water extractor....basically, this place makes the 92Y look like a dump.*270-degree wraparound windows that make the pool seem at one with the Hudson River*Additional shower on the pool deck*Hot tub on the pool deck*Lounge chairs all around the pool deck*Interestingly soft pool sides that lessen the impact when you push off for flip turnsNOT WORTH THE $50 TRIAL:*The extreme West Side location and additional walk of the length of the pier through a cold parking garage full of moving cars and exhaust fumes*Bottleneck of over-aerobicized girls with big money, tired hair, and Lululemon clothing at the front desk because guests (like me) have to fill out a whole information sheet every time and there's no separation of lines*The fact that the pool is not accessible by the locker rooms; you have to don a bathrobe over your wet self, shiver up the stairway, then walk across an elevated catwalk before seeing the pool (though at least you can be entertained by the trampoline step class going on underfoot)*A lifeguard/coach who means well but greets you ""Nee-how"" (I'm not Chinese), then tells you to hop into the deck shower before moving past him to the master class...even if you are clean, but more importantly, visibly dripping wet from the showers in the locker rooms*The extra money. You're going to sweat on a machine - you can do it anywhere. As for the pool, the view might be incredible, but you'll be staring at the pool floor once you start your workout...and that floor is just a regular 25 yards, and hazy from the murkiness of the waterSpecial thanks to the Chelsea Piers swim team, though, for enabling the satisfaction of my curiosity, and for letting me in on a great workout with some great swimmers.",36,0.9968
892,11,19,4.0,"I should preface this review with the acknowledgement that I was very, very drunk when I came here yesterday. Despite Cooper's absurdly close proximity to my apartment, i.e the corner of my street, it was my first time. I don't particularly like the outside of it and based on this alone I expected to be underwhelmed. When you walk in you can see that it's the type of drinking place you will find a baby in and not feel weird about it. I'm in my 30s but I'm not there yet, people. I don't like to see a baby when I'm drinking anything that could lead to bad decisions. Like babies. But then I asked if they had any ciders!!! And they had, like, five different kinds. Usually bars have one/two kinds: Magners or Original Sin. So truthfully, anything greater than 2 kinds of cider is an auto 4-Yelp-stars in my book. Following along with the fine and dandy, my group ordered the truffle fries. My heart exploded. I had fries spilling out of my mouth and yet I grabbed more and stuffed those into my mouth too. I cried out something along the lines of, ""This place needs a Michelin Star! Like Public! Why don't they have one??"" (I think I asked that about five times so it's only fair that I mention it here, too.) Then we ordered more fries. And then I went home! All I had to do was cross the street.",7,-0.3905

I ordered a couple of their salads and the ingredients were fresh, cool, and crisp. Their quiches are tasty, rich, yet doesn't feel heavy. (I think portion size might go into effect here, they are definitely the perfect amount where you DON'T get full, but satisfied). The spreads, breads, and specials are always exciting to see if you would like one (had one of their open faced sandwiches with maybe one of the best scrambled eggs I've ever had with smoked salmon - absolutely delicious, wish it was a regular).Okay - so here are the disclaimers - (I'll write in all caps for emp) DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE IN A HURRY. COME HERE IF YOU WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH GOOD COMPANY OR A GOOD BOOK, BECAUSE THE SERVICE TAKES FOREVER.... but the ambience is charming, also it is a little on the pricey side (also very european, it's like they transferred the price from the dollar to the euro for you).conclusion - come here if you have time to really relax and unwind (does that happen with new yorkers?) and enjoy a healthy, fresh, and clean tasting selection of food.",10,0.9979
894,8,6,4.0,"Same as it ever was - in many ways - but bigger. Ok, here we go. The recently relocated Milk & Honey has uprooted from it's sleepy Eldridge location (to be replaced by Attaboy) to the much more bustling 23rd St at the foot of Madison Sq Park (and Shake Shack!). A supposed improvement is the now possible walk-in system. As of yet this is still in theory more than practice. If you don't get there right as they open, you will probably be subject to the primary door man who can't decide between whether you should just come back in 3 hours, they are fully booked for the night, or if they take numbers and will call you. The problem is, you have no idea what you can expect, so the walk in thing right now is dicey. Honestly, make a reservation online or show up at opening. Also, the front basically looks like a property under construction (which it is). Cute tailor shop it is not.All that said, once inside, you'd be amazed at how much this place looks like a bigger version of the old location. Sure, the bar is on the other side, and Sam Ross's facial hair Du Jour will not be waving in the candlelight, but the overall look, feel, and sexytime lighting remain very similar despite the increased space. The well curated soundtrack of old jazz and blues also remains. There's even a back bar now for additional capabilities. I do hope they open up some food options in the future now that they have a kitchen in the back. GIVE. US. SNACKS!Same bespoke (no menu) cocktails as before, and still of the highest quality. You can find Sasha Petraske actually working the stick on occasion, something he hasn't done much in years. They will craft something to your loose guidelines and do it with aplomb. The bar focuses on perfectly executed classics with a selection of Modern Classics developed at Sasha's bars over the years or by some of NY's bar heavyweights. I personally prefer to have a small menu of seasonal original cocktails available as well, but Milk has never been about that, and as long as the drinks are good you've got to respect that. Service inside is impeccable as always. The people waiting your table are also experienced bartenders, so they really know what they are talking about when making a recommendation.

895,23,21,4.0,"""What's your worst macaron flavor?"" I inquired.Both girls had a hearty laugh, and responded that was the first time they'd heard that question.""Ok. So, what's the flavor you haven't tried yet?""Both hemmed and hawed, and ducked the question.I'm sure normal people need help deciding on which flavors to include in their purchase selection, but when it comes to macarons, I decide based on which to exclude while selecting a dozen - I have to draw the line somewhere you know.... with 16 available flavors the easy exclusion was their most popular: candied bacon with maple cream cheese (I don't eat bacon). With my distaste for white chocolate ganache, a few other eliminations were easy but I debated over getting the Cheetos (also with white chocolate) and wanted the girls to help me say no. They didn't, it turned out to be intriguing, probably a direction that macarons bakers would likely explore in depth in the future (sweet and savory).While the shop is newish, I've purchased regularly from Macaron Parlour at Hester Street Fair and the Union Square Greenmarket. But, I've never really believed that their macarons were superlative, attributing their popularity to the bacon flavor macaron. My biggest gripe with them earlier on was with the meringue shells, that don't age too well and likely suffering as a result of slow turnover in the shop (from carrying a large selection). However, it appears that they have experimented with the texture in intervening years. On my most recent visit, I thought the texture of 4 of the 12 sampled was perfect, but the rest were still too chewy for my liking, and for my expectations of a baker trained in the Pierre Herme School. I've had minor gripes with the unevenness of filling (more Laduree than Pierre Herme) and for some of the flavors: too mute a taste. That said, a few have been exceptional: Crème Brulee, S'Mores, Elvis (Peanut Butter and Caramelized Bananas), and Giggity (chocolate, dulce de leche, peanut marshmallow cream).While I'm still not sure that I'm a fan of their macarons, despite the inventive flavors, I was pleasantly surprised to note that they are not a one-trick pony and carry a selection of other baked goods (croissants, cookies, brownies...). I liked the Blondie (just enough brown sugar to hold together the butter and barely there flour), didn't like the Peanut Butter cookie - and absolutely loved their version of the Kouign Amann (""Queen"" - crisp, caramelized exterior and moist, not too rich interior despite the butter: just perfect!), perhaps as good as the best version in the city at Dominique Ansel Bakery. Now, I don't know the owner from Eve (though an old yelp friend does), but it's clear to me that there is a lot of passion, dedication, experimentation and research to getting things right.Given the above values, Macaron Parlour would be my favorite bakery in the East Village, and I would be here more often but for the maddening fact that this is St. Marks Place - where people apparently believe it's all right to have breakfast pastries starting from noon...",25,0.9962
896,6,6,4.0,"I went to a Brazilian steakhouse many years ago. The place was on Central Ave, but it has since closed down. I remember that I liked the IDEA of a churrascaria, but the execution at this particular restaurant was all wrong. It was chaotic and messy and loud. But I'd heard excellent reviews of Texas de Brazil from several people, so I was eager to try it. Brian and I went on a Saturday and upon entering the restaurant, I immediately knew that this place would be entirely different: a long bar at the right of the entrance was well stocked with a variety of liquors, while the glass wall behind the hostess housed hundreds of bottles of wine. Lounge chairs in the center of the room were a comfortable reprieve for the people who were willing to endure the hour + wait for a table. We were seated fairly quickly in a large, elegant main dining room, and were immediately approached by a smiley server who explained what we could expect from the dining experience. For a $47 fixed price, we'd get the unlimited salad bar and unlimited meat (but we had gotten a deal through Groupon). Our seats were located right by the 47 item buffet salad bar, and while there was salad and assorted vegetables, this bar also had lobster bisque, a variety of cheeses (parmesan, goat, mozzarella), sushi, rice and beans, just to name a few ... one could easily fill up on the salad bar, alone. But we came for the meat. We were instructed to turn over the cards provided at our table from the ""red"" side to the ""green"" side to indicate that we were ready for the gauchos to approach our table. Almost immediately, we were greeted by men bearing bacon wrapped chicken, rack of lack, flank steak, sirloin, pork shank ... I'm embarrassed to say that I was full within five minutes, so we didn't even get to try all the meat that they had. Our server also brought over plantains and mashed potatoes to complement the meat. As stuffed as we were, I can never say no to dessert, and I had eyed the dessert tray at other tables over the course of our dinner, so my curiosity was already piqued. There were an assortment of cakes and pies, but Brian and I both thought they'd be too heavy for us. Our server mentioned a papaya mousse, made with fresh papaya and whipped vanilla ice cream. It was the perfect end to our dinner: light, creamy and not overly sweet. For future reference, I'll remember that next time I should:- Go with a group: It's a really fun place and would be cool to experience with a group of friends or family-Not eat a single thing all day beforehand.

897,11,13,4.0,"Everything here is so cramped. As soon as I walked in, I was standing in line at the front desk. The front desk girls are so patient and have such great personalities. My friend bought me a Groupon package that consisted of a mani/pedi with a 10 minute reflexology (that I've yet to use) and a 70 minute body scrub. I took advantage of the body scrub today and after a few things that turned me off before the scrub, I feel really clean. Not the kind of clean where you take a cold shower after sweating a ton. It was definitely a different kind of clean feeling. I was led to a steam room after I got my robe and cloth underwear on. I seriously cannot stand steam rooms/saunas cause I get claustrophobic and panic. I don't know how I didn't die inside that room cause I was in there for half an hour. It seemed as though everyone forgot that I was in there because after I stopped someone in the hallway that I couldn't breathe, he was shocked that someone was in the steam room. Finally, after about 5 more minutes, this Korean lady that reminded me of my grandmother came in and swooped me downstairs into a large bathroom with curtains. The room wasn't as bright as I thought it'd be and seeing the dead skin on my body after all the scrubbing didn't really freak me out either. I guess because I'm used to seeing it. I've been scrubbed by my aunt in Korea before when I was really young. It was the worst part about my bath/showers. Ironically, today's scrub was very soothing and relaxing even though I asked for ""strong"". Extreme was the maximum and I kinda wished I could've asked for that. The lady who scrubbed me let me know what she was about to do before every thing she did. Letting me know that she was going to apply a cold seaweed serum on my body, and a cucumber mask on my face, etc. Other than the steam room incident, I really was amazed at the body scrub experience. I really loved my lady who spoke to me in Korean the entire time.",16,0.9681

For about $40, you get a salad, steak (granted it is 6 oz but still sizable) or salmon, plus dessert. The same meal at dinner would cost you over $100 and it packs the same great flavors. -The service is some of the best in the city, the wine list is top notch and the location is close to Radio City and the Theater District making this a great pre-show destination.

904,8,8,4.0,"When I was a wee lad, I used to commute to Chinatown in Manhattan with my mom on a weekly basis. Much of my time there involved going to restaurants and shops that I've seen slowly disappear over the years, some replaced by other businesses, others being torn down and replaced by condos and hotels. Chinatown always represented an island of culture to me. It was (and still is) a place I could go and certain cultural expectations would always be there. Food would be cheap, but good. Fruit and seafood would be reasonable in price. Shop owners would scream at you before they'd say ""Thank you"" and you never, ever paid with credit.That Chinatown of my youth is slowly morphing into a blend of old and new. One of the places that is holding steadfast to the ""old"" is Hop Shing. This place has been in Chinatown for as long as I can remember. Indeed, their internal layout echoes that of many long gone shops (including the old layout of Mei Lei Wah). You enter and there's a counter to the left where older gents wait for seating on weekend mornings. Behind the counter are steam shelves with buns, dim sum and more. Then there are a series of booths on the sides with round tables in the center. Seating isn't really formal. You could wind up sharing a table with five guys you don't know (as I did the morning I went).It had literally been years since I had eaten here, so I went for the basics of Dim Sum: Beef meatballs, Soy wrapped pork, Spare rib tips in black bean sauce and a nice pot of Chrysanthemum tea to wash it down (no sugar). The meatballs were excellent. Sometimes shops don't steam them long enough and they're red inside, but these were cooked through and delicious with a bit of vegetable at the bottom of the dish (as it should be). The Soy wrapped pork was fantastic. Imagine a small ground pork patty with vegetables and herbs wrapped in soy in a delicious salty and sweet sauce. Truly one of my favorites. Finally, the rib tips were tasty, but I had hoped they'd have a bit of peppers in them (most restaurants don't do it this way to be fair).The service was ""Chinatown style"", meaning they don't ignore you but they don't go out of their way to help you out either. I did note however that the waiters seemed to dote a bit more on some of the older customers, which was nice to see. A lot of the customers at my table seemed to be regulars and were quite familiar with the staff, which is always encouraging.Hop Shing's biggest drawback is its own success. If you need a table for a part of five or more, expect a wait unless you get there super early. But the same can be said for almost any good Dim Sum place in Chinatown, so take that as you will. I enjoyed my experience but really hope to sit at the counter next time!",9,0.998

(Similar in concept to Goya Malt you might see in the supermarket but totally different flavor.)- They serve bourekas, one of my desert-island foods, basically a savory cheese pastry. It's Israeli street food. - The yucca fries were delicious.- The falafel sandwich is 5.75 + 1 for hummus smeared in there, which isn't too bad.The Could-Be-Better:- The bourek was greasy and not ideally flaky.

This is one of my measures for falafel shop authenticity, at least for Israeli-style falafel. The owner tells me they definitely have this, though, so I'll have to come back. It doesn't feel like a true falafel sandwich to me without some red cabbage in there.",14,-0.3841
907,9,7,4.0,"The same big, gay ice cream concoctions. But bigger, and possibly gay-er storefront! Which is an awesome thing of course, because now I can have my big, gay ice cream even in the dead of winter because this WV location has seating inside!What's also great is that they offer additional soft serve flavors (besides chocolate and vanilla) that apparently change weekly. The coconut I sampled was surprisingly light and subtle in flavor, and the hazelnut brownie sounded totally decadent. I really like that the staff at this location are very attentive and eager to tell you about their concept and explain everything on the menu, as well as offer little sample cups of their different flavors if it's your first time visiting. Personally, I think I still prefer the ice cream at the original location just a tad more. I'm not sure if it's the new machines here or the actual ice cream base, but the soft serve comes out just a little fluffy and not as creamy as what I'm used to from the EV store. The American Globs (my favorite cone) I got here also had a slightly excessive pretzel to soft serve ratio, which left me literally digging inside the hard chocolate and pretzel shell to get to the vanilla soft serve. It was also very saddening to leave quite a large chunk of the chocolate and pretzel shell uneaten - just because the sheer quantity of it got a little overwhelming. All that aside though, I still love BGIC and will certainly be back very soon!",14,0.9359

Walking past this place, I wouldn't have even throught to stop in here for a beer, let alone a burger. But I am glad they posted that sign and I am glad I decided to put their claim to the test.These aren't pre-made frozen patties but handmade freshly ground beef. Piper's Kilt has about a dozen DELICIOUS 8 oz burgers with fries range which won't burn a hole in your wallet at $7.95 to $9.95, or you can supersize them Broadway style (10 oz) for only $2.00 more.And for an even better deal, come here on Tuesday where burgers are half-price all day. You just need to try them all.Steak Sandwich on Garlic Bread with grilled onions and fries - $10.95There are not many places that I've been to that do a good job at steaks but I definitely recommend their Steak sandwich (featured above) for $10.95 which I ordered medium rare was delicious. Not many places understand the difference between well-done and medium rare but Piper's Kilt does.If its drinks that you need, standard pints are about $6 or grab a pitcher of Coors Light for $11 or a Blue Moon or Sam Adams one for $17.They also have daily specials:Mondays: .30 cent Buffalo Wings all day (11:30am-12:30am)Tuesdays: Half-priced burgers all day (11:30am-12:30am)Wednesday: Ladies Night: Half-priced drinks (7:30-11:30pm)Thursday: Latin Day: New Latin items all day.Fridays: Happy Hour Special - $20 Open Bar including Free Hot Buffet (4-6pm or 5-7pm)Weekends: Double Brunch Special (12-3pm or 3-6pm)Are you a Yankee or Rangers fan?

909,7,4,4.0,"Why am I at a random hotel bar in midtown on a random weekday when I'm neither staying at said hotel or have no need to be in this area? A Croque Monsieur sandwich, that's why.A few years ago I came here post-Broadway with a group for libations and noshes when I ordered their now infamous-in-my-book sandwich. I have no idea what magic lies in the egg wash or what they do to their beschamel but it's seriously the best sandwich I have ever had in this city, so much so that maybe once a year I come back just to have this as I did last week. Fluffy, white slices of artisan bread dipped in batter and fried just golden brown with ham, applewood bacon, and soft melty cheese oozing out the sides. It's heaven.Cafe Nicole is a beautiful, softly lit area that you have to ride the elevator up to get to. The bar is quite small, but the lounge area seats a decent amount of patrons but it's usually just chock full of European tourists and a few solo businessmen usually chattering nonstop into their mobiles over gin and tonics. It is quite overpriced for drinks as one would expect a hotel bar in midtown to be, but even Bryant Park's outdoor bar serves cheaper cocktails than here.This is sort of a half-assed review I'll admit, since the only thing I have consumed in about 6 visits to this place are overpriced glasses of white wine, diet cokes, and this sandwich. However, if anyone happens to be reading this who is planning on going there, I'll tell you this: Just get the Croque, you won't be disappointed.",7,0.9264

I came way of Oz via a recommendation of a fellow Elite member. My stylist was Anne. Having several perms in my lifetime, this was my first digital perm experience. Bring a photo with you, as there is a slight language barrier.STEP 1Hair wash with shampoo only to rid of oil and products in your hair.STEP 2Hair cut here, if you want it.STEP 3Protective ear covers are applied. Hair is divided into sections. Thick conditioning treatment is lather to your hair, covering every single strand, avoid the scalp. The your hair is wrapped in plastic, loosely. The chemical smell can be overwhelming at times. After 20 mins, my hair is checked for flexibility. It was not elastic enough, so back in the plastic wrap for another 10mins.STEP 4The thick conditioning treatment is washed out. Go to the bathroom now, this is your only break.STEP 5The rollers. If you've had a perm before, it is pretty much the same process: hair is parted in small segment, the ends are covered with two thin sheets of paper, hair is rolled up. The difference with the digital perm is that the rollers are then wrapped in thick cotton fabric and bond with a rubber band. After the hair are in curlers, each curler is individual ""plugged-in matrix style"" to the machine.STEP 6Additional think cotton fabric is placed in between each rollers so that it does not touch the scalp. Then the machine is set to heat and thus begins the ""curling"" process. The rollers got too hot for me, so it was turned down a notch and cold air was blown at my head for a bit. After 20min, my hair was checked and the heat process was done, the roller unplugged.STEP 7The cotton fabric on each roller is removed, but the cotton fabric between each roller providing the barrier to your scalp remains. The rollers cool for about 15min.STEP 8With the rollers still in, a U-shape basin is placed on your shoulders, the thick cotton fabric is removed, and a tube of cotton is wrapped around your head. A second chemical treatment is poured into each roller. The chemical takes another 20min.STEP 9The rollers are then removed and the hair is washed again.Step 10With the digital perm now complete, comes the drying time. The stylist will part the hair in larger segment, twist it and blow dry the hair. This takes about 15min. Once the hair is dry, use fingers to separate the curls and you're done.I was offered tea and water during this entire process. Service was friendly and professional. I'm still getting used to my perm and it is a bit too curly for me. So I'll give it another week to see how it finally settles down.",24,0.9274

The scrambles (the M category) have a particularly light feel to them-- toast, veggies, mozzarella cheese, and eggs. The M2 or M3 (the one with the Brussels Sprouts) was remarkable.The cornbread that I got a healthy dose of deserves its own paragraph. It was perfectly crispy, perfectly soft, perfectly sweet, perfectly salty, perfectly airy, and perfectly grainy. I don't think I will ever make cornbread that incredible. It was as if they whipped the egg whites to make it extra fluffy. I wanted to float away on a cloud of it.All in all, an awesome spot! It's easier to get a table on a weekday, though, so I don't know how often I will get to go back. I'll leave you with some words to the wise.Tips to make life easy (and delicious) at Shopsin's:1. Line up against the wall and wait for someone to ask for your party size. Don't go looking for people.2. Bring cash.3. Put away your phone.4. Don't have more than four people. Seriously.5.

It was tough drinking this the first day, but the second and third day, it got easier.BEETS ME (carrot, beet, apple, pear, lemon & ginger): Going down, this juice tastes sweet and delicious, but there is an overpowering ginger taste and I hate ginger (I'm probably the only Asian person to hate ginger, but oh well I wasn't going to waste the $115 (including $35 delivery charge) I spent on this cleanse)).ALL GREENS (kale, spinach, romaine, parsley, celery, cucumber & apple): Same ingredients as the first juice, but the addition of apple. Definitely made this juice taste a lot better.ORGANIC COCONUT WATER: I hate coconut water, but this coconut water was actually delicious. I was very tempted to add some vodka and pineapple juice, but I resisted. :)Overall, the cleanse went phenomenally well and wasn't as bad as I thought. I would definitely do a Liquiteria cleanse again, but will do Level 1 next time.

915,5,4,4.0,"I guess you're supposed to consider yourself lucky if you manage to get a table at this tiny place. You'd think you were stepping into someone's studio apartment with the amount of space they have to work with. What they do with that limited space is nothing short of amazing. We came in here on a Saturday night around 7pm and we were able to snag the last two seater table towards the back. As you might have read, they only have enough seating inside for about 17 people with a few stools at the bar. Thankfully, our little table towards the back was slightly removed from the others so we escaped the elbow to elbow experience with other patrons.I guess a smaller place means they focus more attention to the food quality because everything I ate was pretty delicious. Normally I avoid lasagna at restaurants because I'm always disappointed and left with a longing for home cooked lasagnas. Eating this lasagna certainly felt like I was eating a lasagna from someone's home. It was very good and it wasn't as expensive as most lasagnas in restaurants. I also tried the calamari, which was good, but looked a little lonely in the giant pool of red sauce it was in. I wish it had been a bigger portion. The portions here aren't very large, but the prices are moderate enough where you could order more than one thing and not break the bank. Finally, a decent, fairly new restaurant to open on the UWS. I know Piccolo has about three other locations in manhattan but I'm glad they chose this section to open up a new one. This area has a lot of new places that open up and fail.

We listened to Biggie and Method Man while savoring the yummy food and many drinks. Foodwise, the truffle mushroom pizza (as many others have stated) was one of the top items of the night. It was earthy and full of flavor. Truffle oil makes all things better. The BLT Guacamole though was a bit of a letdown. It was a bit bland and I wouldn't recommend this. For our entrees we had the truffle grilled cheese with the side of tomato soup. It was buttery and tasty, but maybe a bit on the small side. My friend had the lobster pot pie and was quite happy with it. We tested out dipping the grilled cheese in the lobster pot pie and it was perfection in each bite. For the sides we got the truffle mac and cheese, the sweet potatoes with marshmallows and the truffle fries (we are truffle fans, obviously.) The mac and cheese was delicious and cheesy and the croutons were a nice touch. The sweet potatoes and truffle fries were just okay though, I wouldn't recommend them with all the other options available. For dessert we had the beignets and the smores by the suggestion of our waitress. Both were quite nice and they put a candle in for the birthday celebrant. The beignets were my favorite of the two and came with a dipping sauce reminiscent of maple syrup. Breakfast for dessert, I don't mind that! Great spot for dinner, I would recommend.

922,6,10,4.0,"Where do I begin with my review on The Box???First of all: The Box is a venue like no other. It is located in such an inconspicuous place, that you would almost wonder if this is a club when you arrive. There is no name to be seen on the outside, but there is the velvet rope, and the doormen.. You walk in, past the supposed 'hard door', and find yourself in a different world. The styling is downright amazingly done. You really feel like you're back in the mid 1920's. The floral wallpaper, the lighting, the cabaret girl swinging in a dreamy way in a hoop above the bar, and all the other artists performing their provocative acts: It all makes sense in a bizarre way. Think of the movie Cabaret, but then add a lot of crack to it, or something psychedelic, such as whatever those people were on in Requiem for a Dream, and you figured out how crazy the acts get here. I am from Amsterdam, and even I have been quite shocked by some of the things I saw going on here. Think of people having erotic acts where they end up drinking one anothers' urine. Or a wasted transvestite, performing an abortion with a coat hanger on top of a toilet on stage. You know? 'Stuff like that'. Watching the shows you see here is kind of similar to discovering the porn of your parents. It's disturbing, appalling, disgusting, but yet: You want to see this. I cannot find any other way to describe how I felt watching all of this. I waited till I had been to this place 3 times before I wrote this, because I felt like that would only be fair in terms of my judgment about it. They've really toned down how extreme the acts are. In a way that it almost became morally and ethically okay again. Last time, they 'only' stripped till they were naked at the end of the act. The weird thing that I realized is that now l kind of miss the sick things that people used to do here on stage. Crazy, I know..... Another thing: Don't be surprised if you're washing your hands next to a transvestite in the restroom, and don't assume that every person that looks like they are part of an act, are actual performers. I found that out in an embarrassing way, by asking a transvestite if (s)he was going to perform and he stated 'no'. (S)he asked me if his dress looked okay on him. I replied, blushing: 'Yes, that polka dot dress looks lovely on you.' The crowd is an inner circle, in vogue kind of New York scene. Enough cool and good looking people to please you, including some models. Not too many tourists, and pretty much zero B&T. The music was really good every time I went. Think house/top 40/ hip hop mixture. Good stuff. Combine all of the above with a good atmosphere, et voila: Le Box.-Key to having fun at The Box: Having a table. That is the ideal situation so you can actually watch the acts without binoculars or standing on your toes, which is what happens if you stick to the bar area. This place gets packed.-Key to getting into The Box: Arrive on time. I suggest 11.30 or midnight. This way you don't have to get into an over packed joint, and you can easily settle down and warm up for the shows which start around 1 or 1.30 AM, enjoy the music, and even dance a little. Nice touch that they hand out complimentary popcorn. Bottom Line: I am a fan of the Box. Yup. : )",22,0.9933

To a certain extent, the atmosphere of Kyotofu reminded me of the corner of the library that I used to hide. The soft music, the polite waitress and the cute cookies make Kyotofu very welcoming to people like me who enjoy being a quiet place to enjoy their food.My favorite dish at Kyotofu is the mushroom salad. The mushroom is sautéed just right and its warmness makes the salad extra appetizing. The dressing is neither too heavy nor too salty, which is rare for salads served in restaurants these days. Although the sesame pudding is a bit too sweet for me, it is so rich that I cannot help to order it again and again. According to my friends, the sesame pudding at Kyotofu is quite authentic and they all recommend Yelpers to try it. I would also suggest having the macha (green tea) latte to balance the sweetness of the pudding. The bitter sweetness of the tea complements well with the richness of the pudding.My friends also enjoy the burgers and the noodles at Kyotofu. However, I would not recommend you getting the soup that appears to be too thick.Despite the fact that the portion of the food at Kyotofu is quite small for its price, the service is superb.

925,12,7,4.0,"After living and working in NYC for so long, its a huge surprise that I didn't make it to Totto until just recently... which actually surprised a lot of my friends. Whatever, I just never got around to it for whatever reason. I honestly didn't understand Kelly and Jack's urgency for me to not only arrive early nor did the reasoning behind them rushing to Totto immediately before it opened to put our names down on the waiting list. This to me sounded simply absurd and as I dragged my ass out of bed early on some cold Saturday morning, I found myself grumbling and wondering how I let these two convince me that this wait and early rising would all be worth it after a bite of the infamous ramen Totto has to offer. Great, not only is it early by weekend standards, we also picked the most frigid NYC winter morning to go. As my luck would have it, there was massive construction on 10th Ave not only causing my taxi to hit traffic, but for my tab to go up. Already in a less than stellar mood, I get to Totto only to see a mob, nay a sea of Asians waiting patiently on the sidewalk. What is this madness, you may ask? Totto Ramen. Oh what we will do for a good bowl of soup and delicious noodles... some old woman started cursing and yelling at us ramenheads because we were hungrilly blocking her way. I overheard her grumble about how crazy us Asians are, waiting in such sub zero weather for our noodles. I finally squirmed my way into one of those wind barrier door blocking things and spotted Kelly C. and Jack. We were in luck because of their strategic name placing, we were within the next two parties to be seated. Keep in mind that Totto is cash only, so while you are on line... you most likely have time to walk to your bank and back, or utilize one of those shady ATM's locatd next door (that's what I did...)Totto Ramen is without a doubt, a hole in the wall establishment... and I wouldn't have it any other way. This is part of the cause of the impossibly long lines. As we got seated by the bar, I really enjoyed the open kitchen view- I felt like I was part of the delicious ramen making process!! Like the restaurant, the menu is simple, offering you a few choices with slight variations. I had the pork ramen and added an egg. What makes Totto so specially delicious is the soup. It is so flavorful and fills you up with a smile that the crazy wait and obstacles you just endured are suddenly worthwhile and you begin to wonder when the next time you will make the ramen pilgramige to Totto. Watching the cooks make the amazing magic broth and other goodies from scratch made my mouth water, even though I already polished my bowl off and could not fit more food if I wanted. Totto Ramen is one of the best ramen places NYC has to offer, the only hassle is that horrible wait. However, if you have crafty and food driven friends like I do, you might be in luck and will be able to taste the Totto with as minimal wait as possible! It's definitely worth the wait, perhaps pick a warmer day then when we went.",11,0.9961

Finally, I walked toward the staircase and made my way down and saw a ""main character"" rush by with a mob of people running after her--I started running too obviously. So the story began..I saw snippets of scenes, repeats of scenes, followed different people, ran/crawled/etc but mostly you can find me in the Candy Shop sampling all the candy waiting for the confusion to end. I compared the scenes I saw with my BF after the show. I saw a lot more than him but I was still nowhere close to making sense of anything. At least I got my Blair&Chuck moment in the Candyshop!!PS: -The punch tastes like Black Licorice. Not a lot of people like that flavor..-If you are short, prepare to not see a lot. Or be aggressive and push to the front. -If you are fat you just wont be able to crawl to some places. (its okay, i crawled and it didn't lead me to anywhere of importance..just got my pants dirty)-Don't go on a first date...you will probably be apart most of the timeSo why 4 stars? Obviously the acting and stuff was good ....and if everyone else gets it then it must be ME! I must be retarded! No really, that's how I feel right now..like my brain is just not good enough.",20,0.5852

The Hataka only came with one char shu which was so tender and lean, so you might want to add an extra one for $1.50 if you desire, but I was perfectly filled at the end of my meal.

929,10,17,4.0,"Doctor: So, what brings you into the office today?Patient: Doctor, I've been having painful sensations in my legs. Doctor: Is that so? Have you been urinating more frequently than usual?Patient: Yes, actually I have, I've been peeing all the time. And I've also been super thirsty lately. I feel like I'm always either drinking water or pissing it out.Doctor: Hmm...have you noticed any changes in your vision?Patient: Well, now that you mention it, I've been having some blurry vision over the last couple of weeks.Doctor: Okay. Well then, I'm going to check your blood sugar and your hemoglobin A1C because I suspect that you may have diabetes.*Patient: Oh no! I guess eating all of those almond croissants, eclairs, macarons, and other delicious French pastries finally caught up to me...**--------------------So how does someone end up overindulging in almond croissants, eclairs, etc? Well, after you walk into FP Patisserie, you might become a repeat customer all too easily. Just months after Eric Kayser opened up his boulangerie/patisserie/cafe, Francois Payard makes his triumphant return to the Upper East Side with this patisserie directly across the street from Maison Kayser. FP Patisserie is basically a pastry shop (no breads, baguettes, etc) that offers seating at a bar or in a more formal dining room area. The interior of the shop feels more like a posh designer clothing store or jeweler than a patisserie. There are glass cases not entirely dissimilar to what you would find in a jewelry store, only here, instead of diamond rings and necklaces, they are showcasing St.-Honorés, eclairs, tarts, and chocolates. Towers of macarons adorn the counters, and they even have sorbets available. Really, it's quite an impressive display -- mesmerizing, actually -- and speaks to the level of care and attention to detail that is going into each pastry. On my first visit, I went with my go-to order and the standard by which I judge and compare all patisseries: the almond croissant ($3.50). Texturally, there was a satisfying crunch and flakiness to the croissant. There was a generous slathering of frangipane on the top, creating a crisp, delicious coating for the croissant. The amount of frangipane lining the interior was just right: not an excess of it weighing down the croissant, but enough so that you know that it's there. Good number of layers? Check. Not too dense or soggy? Check. Sweet, satisfying, and altogether quite delicious, this is an almond croissant that, while not quite as exemplary as what I tried in Paris (insert reminiscing thoughts here), is certainly up there with some of the best in NYC.Price-wise, FP Patisserie is comparable to other French bakeries in the city -- that is, you'll be paying more for a breakfast here than at your typical bagel place or doughnut shop, but the cost is not prohibitive, and the quality of the products actually justifies the price. You probably can't come here for breakfast every day, but then again, that probably wouldn't be so good for your BMI or hemoglobin A1C, either. I came here shortly after the store opened on its first day, but customer service wasn't an issue, as the servers that I interacted with were friendly and accommodating. Based on the almond croissant that I enjoyed here on my first visit, I may find myself returning here more often than I should. You may find yourself doing so, too, but don't say I didn't warn you about what happens to those who eat more than their fair share of delicious pastries!--------------------* Yes, I just went there. I'm a dork, I know. ** Eating excessive amounts of almond croissants, eclairs, macarons, and other delicious French pastries is not recommended, and I don't advocate this.",11,0.9977
930,10,9,4.0,"In search of a tasty new restaurant and impromptu photography lesson, I joined fellow Yelper Lori L. for dinner at Morimoto's new Asian fusion / comfort food joint. Tribeca Canvas deserves a solid four stars, but if I were to break it down, (a-la Paul H.-style), it'd be as follows:Food (taste) - 5/5Food (portion to price ratio) - 3/5Decor & staff professionalism - both 5/5Timing of apps & entrees - 3/5Morimoto sitting at next table and taking a post-meal photo with us - priceless! Per the feedback in other reviews, we ordered two lamb buns and two hamachi tacos, priced individually at $5 apiece. A shared order of lotus root chips completed our appetizer choices. The buns reminded me of the duck buns at Madam Geneva - Here, biting through a cloud-like layer of bread revealed delicious slow-braised shredded lamb with a tasty sauce. The tacos, while much smaller for the same $5 price tag, were tasty as well and wrapped up in a crispy shell. I was initially fearful that my first bite into the taco would shatter the shell entirely, but the shell managed to stay together in once piece as I nibbled my way from end to end. The lotus root chips were OK, but if I come back, I'd definitely give something else a try.After a tough decision process between both pork entrees, Lori opted for the Pork Belly Yakiniku...a wise choice! The pork belly was juicy and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and the accompanying sauce had just the right amount of kick to it. I ordered the Duck Duck Cous - seared duck breast (the best part), duck leg confit gyoza, and mole duck jus. The duck, while tasty, was much smaller than Lori's pork belly portion. Thankfully, we pretty much split everything down the middle and both of us left satisfied - not overstuffed.Although we were promptly seated at our 7:30 reservation time, and everyone was extremely friendly and professional, a few small hiccups keep this place from being a 4.5-5 star restaurant in my book. Our waitress was quick to take app and drink orders, but the appetizers came out a few minutes apart from each other. After all apps and drinks arrived, our waitress was nowhere to be found. A floor manager checking up on us ultimately decided to take our orders, admitting that our waitress was ""very busy"" at the moment. The entrees were also staggered in delivery, with her pork belly arriving on our table about five minutes earlier than my duck entree. Thankfully, we were splitting both so I wasn't left watching and salivating!It's hard to knock a brand new restaurant for the small service glitches above, but given the caliber of every other aspect of the meal, they should iron out the kinks in the kitchen so everything is ready and arrives to our table at the same time. Also, Tribeca Canvas was very busy for a Wednesday night, so again, perhaps a misstep in staffing for the evening left our waitress a bit overworked.All in all, we both had a great time, and the icing on the cake was the photo op with Iron Chef Morimoto himself, who just so happened to be sitting at an adjacent table...SWEET!Here's the pic: yelp.com/biz_photos/trib…",15,0.9964
931,11,13,4.0,"My friend had been following TDR's progress over several weeks, and after many a sarcastic remark regarding its actual opening date, I finally spied the soft open on Friday. With Storm Nemo blowing into town, we secured an early release and came to check out this Irish-colored, vintage-minded dispensary of spirits and victuals.At the door we were greeted by a friendly chap who informed us that the cocktail lounge (The Parlor) was upstairs, while the ground level offered a more informal bar stool experience (The Taproom). We parked by the bar, which filled up healthily shortly after 5 pm, when it opened (and will continue to open late till sometime this week). The friendly, opening-mode bartenders took turns offering us samples of grog (nice) and other concoctions, while a beer rep served everyone to a round of Pilsner Urquell. Cheers! More interesting was the Founder Porter, which was on tap; one of about a dozen well-chosen selections. The fact that this place has affiliations with Swift as well as Ulysses came as no surprise.We celebrated with some fine rare-vintage Jamesons, courtesy of my Irish Whiskey-loving friend. Unfortunately the well-appointed pub was not serving food just yet, so we turned the corner to Fraunces Tavern for some overpriced dinner fare. Upon our return we headed upstairs to check out the bar's claim to fame: mixology. Sketches of great Americans and mood lighting painted a pretty nice, cozy scene in the Parlor. But you want to come here for the drinks.My Julep a la Thomas was amazing (Old Forester 100-proof Bourbon, Marie Brizard Parfait Amour, Pernod Absinthe, eau de thé, fresh mint) and the waitress-recommended General Harrison (Woodford Reserve Bourbon, Christian Drouin Cidre Bouché, egg batter, fresh cream, Demerara sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, allspice) was cloying and decadent. It's a thick egg-nog full of tasty booze, so moderate your intake.Toward the end of the night I dozed off watching the snow falling over FiDi outside. This is not out of norm for me, and the bar staff were predictably miffed, my friends reporting that the waitress' charm definitely dwindled from that point on. Oh, well, I am who I am. Just as we headed for a quiet conclusion to the evening, a Danny DeVito sighting at the table by the bathroom quickly lifted our drunken spirits. Of course, one of my buddies couldn't stop himself from offering Danny a drink (which the man politely declined), but he did manage a pic with him downstairs when we ran into him on the way out (photo-bombed by yours truly). Apparently, Brooke Shields was also in the house for the soft open. If it's good enough for DeVito, it's good enough for you.",13,0.99

The flavor was riveting and good times were percolating.

Staff was very efficient and friendly, serving our food in a very timely manner. Some of us were enjoying our drinks in the lounge and while others were stumbling around in the basketball court. Everyone finally sat down when our wings and pizza came and were catching their breath while eating. Food was great!

Steak perfect and all the right accoutrements 4 - beef brisket - a special. Pretty good. Might get a lil boring vs the enchilada which has more fun goodies/toppings3.5 - lamb shank. A properly done lamb shank should always score a 5. But there were weird globs of either pure fat or thyme leaves and ""crud"" that I had to occasionally spit out. A touch under seasoned and could use some additional umph like a red wine reduction blah blah blah. 3.5 - Guacamole. No doubt fresh and creamy but they really should add cilantro lime and even small bits of red onion and tomato diced , otherwise just call it Avocado mash.The partida or whatever rec tequila was nice and smooth tho its a bit lame they charge 2 bucks for the tomato juice chaser shot (the chaser was actually quite amazing almost like a Bloody Mary).They swiveled our table sideways to accommodate a couple late arrivals which was really nice of them. We didn't necessarily want to hang out with Dave but it actually turned out alright. He still owes me 50 bucks tho - that's right Dave, how come u never carry cash, that's like what girls do so they never have to pay. Come 'on Dave!

The bride-to-be shared a rib eye steak (I think?!) with her friend and when our waiter brought it out...he said: ""Is this big enough for you?"" That line stuck with me the entire night.

936,8,5,4.0,"I had a great late lunch on a lazy Sunday at El Centro recently, complete with margaritas and a big group table in the front corner of the restaurant. A group of five of us walked in around 3:45 / 4 pm which is usually an odd off time for most restaurants. Not at El Centro! The kitchen was still going and the restaurant was a comfortable level of busy. They accommodated our big group immediately and the nice staff brought us waters along with our menu. We asked them about pitchers of Margaritas but alas, they do not offer pitchers. A la carte Margaritas & Coronas were ordered all around. I decided to make mine a Guava Margarita $10.00, one dollar more than their standard on the rocks. It was delicious, and far larger than I was expecting!!! They serve their margaritas in a tall pint glass with just the right amount of tequila and guava juice. It went very well with the seemingly endless bowl of chips and salsa that they kept bringing. The salsa was a nice smoky chipotle sauce that was a unique touch compared to your stand bland mild sauces. The decor of El Centro is certainly kitchy with their zillions of painted tin chatchki's nailed to the wall and the many actual corona chandeliers that hang from the ceilings. For my entree I order the tamarind braised short ribs for $9.00. It was exactly what I was craving, slow cooked beef brisket with a very tasty sauce, cilantro and white cheese. It was a little messy so I had to use the fork and knife, but I wouldn't have it any other way, all of the juices were delicious. Looking forward to the next time I am hungry for Mexican and am in hells kitchen. They also had a good amount of outdoor seating so will try to return here again in the summer months!",7,0.977
937,6,6,4.0,"I came here on Saturday night with seven of my amigas (ok and one amigo) to celebrate my birthday. I have been wanting to come to Cienfuegos for a while, so I was really excited when my friends were down for some Cuban food as well! First off, the decor is really ridiculously adorable and unique. The lighting is VERY dark. Almost to the point of obnoxious to be honest. They could raise the lights a teensy bit so perhaps people could see what they are eating and drinking? My friends and I sat in the back in a lounge-like seating area, which was cute, but I was expecting real tables. This made eating and drinking a little difficult in my opinion. Food. The food is quite tasty, but the portions are really small for the cost. This probably wouldn't be an issue if you were here as a party of two or at maximum four, but when you have eight hungry peeps, ordering tapas and having three baby sized empanadas come out, your group will be ravenous after dinner. Luckily we were more interested in imbibing than eating. We ordered two punch bowls - The Honey Badger and Intro to Awesome. Honey Badger was spicy and had a great kick to it and the Intro to Awesome as a little lighter and had hints of cucumber. After we demolished both $75 punch bowls, we decided to move on to the Skull Drink. I actually do not know if it was called this, but it came in a large skull mug. This probably should have served as a warning to us, much like a Jolly Roger (skull and crossbones flag) on a pirate ship. If not this, the ingredients alone should heed caution, which included absinthe and 151 among other lethal types of alcohol. Now I know why there is a limit of one per customer.... woweeee.. I was sailing after that drink. So good, but my head hurt so bad in the morning.So, three stars because I wasn't that impressed by the food, but the ambiance and drinks were a solid five. Let's just compromise and give them a four and call it a day. I would come back but with a smaller group and if large, just to drink the skull drink again because dinner was expensive (although I didn't pay.. thank you friends!) and I think we all left hungry.",7,0.9857

Go to to Spitzers, or what have you, and enjoy a beer or two while you wait for your table (because you didn't want to eat at 5:30 anyway). Head back to Mission Chinese when they call you an hour later. Take a trip to Flavor Town.That's right, Guy Fieri, I hijacked your cute little slogan because it is not applicable to whatever you are doing in Times Square.Our group of four knocked back 6 or 7 plates, including the Chongqing Chicken Wings (""explosive"" is right chili, crispy beef tripe - $10; good, but those mofos are spicy as all hell, for real); the Char Siu Pig Ear Terrine (dill pickles, mung bean sprouts, torn herbs, - $9, you know you want it); the Beijing Beef Pancake (confit beef shoulder, salted chili, hoisin, griddled flat bread, $10, basically a pocket of heaven); and the Salt Cod Fried Rice (slow cooked mackerel, chinese sausage, lettuce, egg, $11.50; get on it), amongst a few other things that have coalesced in my brain into a cloud of spicy pleasure (okay, maybe that was fueled by the magnum of sake we enjoyed with our dinner, but anyway).On your way out, dip into the bathroom for an eerie 90s television throwback.

It's not that the food at RM is bad, but rather you get roughly the same quality here but at a somewhat lower price point.Where to start? I'm a fan of pretty much most of their menu. Can't say enough about their tasty enchiladas, excellent ceviches, flavorful guacamole, awesome tacos, and the big surprise, their incredible corn on the cob. I always make a point of ordering this no matter what. It's that good, right down to the last tender kernel. Drinks here are also pretty solid. Their mango mojitos are deadly. I always end up drinking way too much of this, but it's so worth the hangover. Margaritas are also decent. I docked a star because the seating here (especially on the first floor) is pretty tight. It also gets mad crowded here at times, which partially explains why the service can be painfully slow at times.Unfortunately this place is no longer a theater district secret. People flock here and for good reason. Just leave yourself enough time in case service gets slow before you need to catch a show.

941,16,9,4.0,"Even when their popularity seems to be relying mainly on their oyster+beer happy hour (6 oysters out of the daily list+1 beer for $12, from 5 to 7pm), that shouldn't be the only reason. The inviting ambiance. Casual and intimate. Good for a date but as good to meet your friends on a random evening. It really can not be overlook at Upstate. Loved the exposed brick walls and the lighting. The food presentation is over gray slate pieces. Don't ask me why, I just love it in that way. I really love too how friendly those guys are. Your party need to be complete to be seated but they will write down your name and reserve a table on the spot. We were attended exceptionally. From our demand for oyster and beer pairing recommendation to having water continuously on the table and even someone to check how we were doing on a regular basis. The oysters?? well. Never been a fan of them, I have to say, but even so, I really enjoyed the couple that I got. Definitely, fresh. My friends, with a much more educated oyster palate than mine, are becoming frequent patrons in here. Figure who I am picturing with the same tendency on a near future. Will they got me to like oysters at the end? I dunno. But if that implies to enjoy again their fantastic scallops over a bed of mushroom risotto. So flavorful and comforting on a cold night like this days. I definitely overlook the slightly overcook scallops and rice, because the flavor made it up for both. Similarly, their squid salad with kale and citrus, ponzu and honey sauce was fantastic. We all loved their citric tone, very delicate but that made the salad to stand out from a regular seafood salad. The squid was slightly overcook as well and absent of crispy edges, but the grill and seasoning was fantastic and once again made it up for the misses. One more. Steamed clams. You gotta try this. The aroma reminds me to my mum's: onion and wine cooking slowly for a wonderful broth. I dunno. I am not an oyster person, but I have really like Upstate very much.

942,8,3,4.0,"I had the opportunity to dine at AFTH last weekend, and it was wonderful! The restaurant's spacious, industrial decor is humbled by down-to-earth, plaid-donning staff and the huge wood-fired clay oven. The vibe truly encompasses the idea of ""Vermont-based pizza company meets the big city"".  The menu features 3 salads and 8 specialty flatbreads, with a daily special and an option to create-your-own. Beginning with drinks, there is an impressive list of beer on tap, as well as many wine varietals, by the glass. I recommend a glass of Bodegas Ercavio Tempranillo. Its medium-bodied, juicy finish paired exceptionally well with the menu's seasonal harvest vegetables. We shared the spiced pecan and winter vegetable salad. The salads are slightly larger than typical starter salads, so the size was appropriate to share or to eat alone. The beets and squash were fresh, juicy, and ripe, and the orange-basil vinaigrette provided a subtle, tangy accent. I would have been happy with more vegetables atop the bed of greens, but overall, the salad was delicious. Now for the fun part. We ordered the large punctuated equilibrium flatbread, which was topped with roasted red peppers, kalamata olives, red onions, rosemary, and a blend of mozzarella and goat cheeses. Our server suggested that a large flatbread serves two people and he was correct. We almost finished the entire large pizza. The thin crust was light and thin, on the softer side, with just a hint of char. The combination of toppings create a melt-in-your-mouth wonderful taste. I would have liked more toppings on the pizza, too, as they were skimpy. Overall, AFTH is a cool and cozy, down-to-earth addition to the Tribeca neighborhood, serving delicious American cuisine. We were extremely satisfied by our experience and look forward to returning quite soon (possibly tonight).

The lady ice cream slinger certainly knows her way around and expertly crafted my confection of choice.I guess I was surprised that the ice cream was soft serve, I was expecting hard packed homemade vanilla, but in context it was perfect. For those who do not know, the Salty Pimp is served in a sugar cone with dulce de leche drizzled inside.

I normally go to other cities (New Orleans, Atlantic City, DC) for this type of entertainment because Manhattan and Queens clubs don't offer the type of experience that a couple can enjoy together. Sin City does. There are several reasons why Sin City stands out. 1) There is a mix of women here that includes various body types, races and looks (because not everyone wants a dance from a blond Eastern European lady). 2) The prices not ridiculous, even if you buy bottle service (I never get bottle service, but here it doesn't seem that bad). 3) The music is all hip hop and the DJ actually mixes once in a while instead of just calling up girls to the stage in that weird strip club DJ voice4) Girls go to this club just as much as (if not more than) the men. This gives the room a more laid back vibe since there isn't the overabundance of testosterone that infects other strip clubs. I've seen straight/ bi girls throw wig parties here and there are always groups of lesbians holding things down all over the room.5) The uncomfortable hands off policy that permeates other venues isn't really enforced here. I'm sure security is watching, but if the girl is comfortable with you things are much more relaxed.Now having said all that there are three things to keep in mind. First, if you decide to show up after 11, you will get a hassle at the door and you might not get in at all. Second, if you only stand by the bar you will be frustrated because you need to go to the main floor for the best time. Finally, this is still a strip club.

See, Lot-Less is a chain of stores (there's another one downtown in the City Hall area) and when I visited my first one last year, I was impressed with their prices and some of their clearance items, but the store literally looked like it was in a building due to be condemned in a few years. The shelves and some of the small islands of stuff were probably in use during the Reagan administration so I wasn't impressed with the locale (but again, their stock and prices were great!).Fast forward to now and Lot-Less has opened up a new shop on 40 street right near Port Authority Bus Terminal. This location is larger than the other one I've visited and since it's newly renovated the space is nicely laid out, organized, clean and really well staffed. I've been going for over a month now and I have to tell you, I'm honestly shocked at how nice this place is kept. Normally discount stores like this look like they were raided by pirates and zombies working together, but this shop rarely has much out of place, and even if it's out of place in the evening, by the next day it's all fixed up. Items are easy to find and there's always a staff member floating around somewhere to ask questions.I mainly go to this store as a toy collector, looking for discounted toys that may have previously been hard to find or too expensive and I've often found such deals here. One toy that was once about $60 was now marked down to $30. A smaller one that used to be about $10.99 at Toys R Us was now $7.99. These are great prices! It's not just toys however. There's a nice dish drying cloth I picked up for $2.99, Crayola style art supplies for about $10 and even reasonable prices on items like Melba Toast and Irish Oatmeal. It's really quite impressive because stores that usually have such prices are selling ""off brands"" or near expired, grungy items but everything here looks crisp, new and not something that got kicked out of the back of a UPS truck.I really enjoy shopping here and it's been a big help with Christmas shopping too! I really recommend a visit if you're looking for a sort of ""mini"" department store to check out.",16,0.9966

As Lori and I selected our various cake-cups and mugs of hot cocoa, some wires got crossed between us, we exchanged cash, I had the idea in my head that she paid with her debit card, we sat down at the geometrically-shaped table...and soon were interrupted by a kind, ""I hope you're enjoying your food ladies...but you DO have to pay for it eventually.""*head desk*More appropriately...*head geometrically-shaped table*Please forgive my momentary spaceiness / vapidness. I assure you, I'm usually on my game, nor would I ever ""dine and dash"". (I place the blame on being stressed out by grad school and work, coupled with the red wine I had previously consumed pre-arrival. Ha!)THAT being said, this place really IS the bee's knees! (Yep. I am clever with my words.) Their cake-cups are apparently all of the rage, so Lori and I decided to sample a few. We tried...The Red Cherry: Red Velvet Cake with Morello Cherries and Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting.The Detzel: Vanilla Cake with White Chocolate Mousse & Raspberry Jam.Carrot: Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese & German Chocolate Frostings.All cakes were served in small cups with layers of crumbled cake, coupled with various jams, frostings, and fillings. This is certainly a unique approach on cake. Due to the crumbled-up pieces, but it wasn't as filling as an actual pieces of cake, but the satiation of eating a piece was achieved. PERFECT.The staff convinced me to get hot cocoa, and, unbeknownst to her, convinced Lori to get a mug as well. ""Wait...I ordered that?"" she asked, slightly bewildered as two mugs appeared on the counter. I had to commend the staff for their good salesmanship, getting her to order the cocoa without realizing it. Ha! (That is a SKILL, friends.) This drink? Superb. Made with real cocoa, that flavor shined though as it was not doused with sweeteners. I do prefer the bitter taste of cocoa IN my hot cocoa. (So, it's not just a clever name...) The steamed milk was amazing, as I kept sipping though layer upon layer of foam. That's one of those ""comfort food"" elements to me: fluffy foam on a hot drink. I was in my element.Backtracking, the staff, though surely (...and, well, deservedly...) making fun of us for momentarily forgetting to pay our bill, was delightful and extremely conversational. Cool guys, indeed! I need to make the journey back. There are more cake-cups to be tried, and I feel as if it is my duty in life to do so.",10,0.996

Its a Russian themed bar that carries any type of vodka that you can think of.From 4-7 they have 2 shots/glasses of wine/beers for $10. And that comes with a small appetizer as well. For those in it to win it they have unlimited shots of their infused vodka's for 2 hours for $30. You probably wont be able to try them all but they have an big list of around 100 or so. I'd recommend any of the ones infused with bacon. You can never go wrong with bacon.Also to go along with the Russian theme (and add to your enjoyment) they have several Russian hats and coats, fake guns, and bottle of vodka shaped like guns that you can wear and use to take pictures. The more shots you take the more awesome the hats become.When I went I was with a group that was there for the infused vodka experience and not so much the Russian cuisine. We did order a few baskets of Vareniki (Ukrainian dumplings with meat) for the table. They came out hot and tasted better than I thought they would.All in all this is a really fun place to go with a group of friends who in the mood to drink and experience something a little different.",7,0.9878

Because it tastes good, yes, but also because it's a pain in the ass to make for yourself. You gotta go get the sheets of pasta, just to get home and realize half of them broke on the trip home. You gotta get a truckload of cheese, and you need to find your one baking dish, and then you have to spend an hour scrubbing off the baked on whateverthefuck entrenched into the pan. And then you gotta sit on your hands for hours WAITING for the thing to get ready, like some high maintenance girlfriend whose scent teasingly wafts through the apartment but doesn't let you touch her until you're dead on the floor with impatience.And then you fucking have to eat that lasagna for a whole week because you live a miserable, lonely, existence with no one to share your pasta with.THAT's why people order lasagna when they go to a fancy place like Il Buco. So, if you're gonna be a witty motherfucker and decide to serve some kind of deconstructed, post-modern, NON-LASAGNA, with what looks like strips of TORN lasagna sheets, and no cheese 'xcept a few shavings of parmesan, and it basically is, really, just a small plate of pasta that a fella' coulda made for himself quite simply, then you either gotta SAY SO on your menu, or that dish better SING like the 3 Tenors of Noho, and shatter the cold cobblestone conglomerate that is my doubting heart.Your lasagna did neither, Il Buco. There was no warning on your menu and the lasagna dish itself had a simple, bland, flavor profile with no sharpness, acidity, or heat to add interest and buoyancy. And I'm speaking to you in this fierce and passionate way because... because... I like you. There, I said it.I like you! I like your space. I like your service a lot, from the waitress to the busboys to the hostess, who were attentive yet chill, never projecting any anxiety to the diners. I like your bread, which is crusty yet never punishing to the tender roof of the mouth... a rare feat.  I like your pickled vegetable sides and espresso-laced desserts. And I...

GET the butternut squash soup! I mean, GET IT! It was heavenly. Quite possibly the second best soup I've ever had. The flavor, the texture, the gingerbread croutons. The amuse of the halved fig topped with goat cheese was to die for. I wanted to order a plate of them. Their bread, yes it's amazing. My 12oz Filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The house made steak sauce was delightful but really not needed as the steak was perfect au natural. They had some special sides for the holiday so we went with the traditional stuffing and whipped butter potatoes. Both were just ok in my book. The shining star of a side dish was of course their famous corn creme brûlée. So good that one per person really should be ordered. Desserts were mid road but the creativity and presentation behind their ice cream creations did not go unappreciated. The brown butter pecan sundae was fab but I'd skip the banana s'mores ice cream cake. The sticky toffee with fig ice cream is a must. Corkage is available for a modest $35 for wines not on their wine list. Speaking of modest, i felt that the meal for the price we paid was a steal. Corkage, 2 soups, 2 steaks, 3 sides, 3 desserts, 2 coffees, all for $214 pre tip. Not bad if you ask me. Our service was just ok but the waiter that was helping the table to our right and down was Fantastic. He stopped and chatted with us a bit so I felt like he was ours in a way.

Open the doors and you are suddenly inside a dark cozy lair, surrounded by antique looking medicine bottle that line the wall, plush couches and chairs, and a bunch of people in white lab coats fiddling by the bar. Is this some kind of Chinese medicine establishment? An abandoned pharmacy? Well...We are at Apotheke. Yes, its supposed to be an old apothecary hence the name and decor. The interior is really beautiful and sexy but at the same time intriguing. I love the location and entrance to this place, its definitely a speakeasy. You really have to search and hunt for this gem, which is half the fun of going to speakeasies. At first I couldnt even figure out which door I was supposed to go in and thought I had to go through the Chinese restaurant. It's definitely exciting to step through those doors. A very wonderful surprise. The bartenders are dressed in white lab coats and they will hand you a ""presciription"" list (the menu) with an incredible list of concoctions depending on your ""ailment"" or I guess mood for the night. All of their cocktails sound amazing and although they are on the pricier side (15 bucks a pop), they are worth every single sip. I chose from the category of ""Painkiller"" and got the Hecho De Mexico since I have a weakness for spicy drinks. It was tequila, tamarind, lime, agave nectar and habanero sauce for a nice kick. It was delicious. It definitely killed whatever pain I had anywhere! It was tangy and spicy, very well balanced and went down smoothly. The second drink I had came from the ""Stress Relievers"" section and it was called Bees Knees. Amazeballs!!! Vodka with bee pollen and guava and goji berry with some ginger, it was a party in my mouth. I could have drank five of them. It sure took all my stress away! So good and dangerous. I am dying to try everything on their menu. It all sounds so amazing and they really take the time to perfect each drink.On certain nights they have a charming live jazz band and they also now have Prohibition Wednesdays where they have a special menu of really old time drinks like moonshine flights, old timer, sazerac and bathtub gin. made with the freshest fruits and vegetables and fantastic liquor.Apotheke is really special and a place to bring good company where you can really enjoy drinking and good music and have a true speakeasy experience.

I also love the huge windows that overlook Greenwich. Starring out at a quintessential New York street to really add to that West Villagey feel.The sangria here is excellent.

I spend a fair amount of money here -- more than just a cup of coffee a day, upwards of $10-$15 every visit -- but that's about to end. I'm better off going to the library on 145th. There may not be coffee there, but at least I can work on (web-based) projects without losing my progress halfway through. It would be tolerable if the staff cared even a little bit about the issue -- but anytime I ask what's going on with the wifi, I get at best indifference and at worst a slight attitude. The last straw was last week, when I was filling out an important job application. It was due by 6pm... and I showed up at Chipped Cup at 4pm. It should have taken me no longer than an hour, but I never got it in on time because the Internet was so slow and kept disconnecting. The staff claims its a Time-Warner issue (which I believe), but then why offer free wifi? Or, duh, get a better router -- other staff members have said the internet goes down when too many people are using it (while, of course, shrugging their shoulders). If the wifi were reliable, I'd give this place four stars. If the staff here were actually skilled in something other than chatting amongst themselves in self-important hipster ways (no, I don't care about the haunted house you go to in Connecticut every year) -- like, say, customer service -- it might even warrant five stars.

I've also had the bulgogi and the spicy pork which are both very good as well and even their dumplings are pretty solid. As people have noted, the seating area is pretty sparse (hence, why we do delivery).

961,6,6,4.0,"Let me start with the most important part first. Bone marrow and uni?! Yes please!As for the rest of our meal, my wife and I were both pleasantly surprised by The Marrow. I think we had some underlying concerns that this might turn out to be an overhyped ""Top Chef"" meal from an overextended chef capitalizing on his television fame. The dishes we ordered though were all excellent from appetizers through dessert. Our meal was as follows:The Bone Marrow - I can't add much to this beyond what I already said in the first line of my review. We were originally just going to order one of these, but neither of us felt like we were likely to want to share, so we both ordered one. That proved to be a solid decision.Prime Beef Tartar - If you're willing to eat raw beef, this was a good version. I've had beef tartar in the past that looked kind of like a scoop of Shop Rite ground beef on a plate, but this was definitely not that. Nicely cubed, high-quality beef with crispy chips.Braised Beef Short Rib - If you look on the website, the menu says brisket for this dish, but at least for the night we went it was short ribs. I love short ribs! These were quite good and cooked fork tender and also served with polenta, escarole, and red sauce. Nothing fancy necessarily, but sometimes quality ingredients can just speak for themselves.Pan-roasted Scottish Salmon - This was my wife's main dish. I feel like salmon is one of those things that has sort of become like chicken on menus. People always feel like they should order something ""fancier"" when they're eating out. A well-cooked salmon dish though can be fine dining, and this fell into that category according to my wife. I tried a bite and thought it was great. Cooked perfectly medium rare.Ginger Stout Cake - As someone else mentioned in their review, this was awesome. Maybe a tad on the sweet side, but hey, it's a dessert.Berliners - Donuts with chocolate sauce. This also falls into the ""not fancy"" but still yummy category.Service was friendly and dishes came out quickly. Our waiter probably didn't know the menu quite as well as he should have, but it didn't negatively impact our overall experience. The only thing I was slightly disappointed with was the cocktails. I ordered the Bank Robber and thought I would be getting a manly drink since it has bourbon, but it was reddish and in a girly glass LOL. It was plenty strong but not really my thing.

I'd actually select the bar, where as with other places, this is a punishment for those who did not make a reservation. This is with the exception of the seats that are closest to the kitchen. It primarily gets the tourism off of MUJI and the non-locals in the district. The Service: It's your typical Japanese wonderfully polite service. They were slightly slow for us, as we did not have a reservation and were sitting in a corner. I guess you don't put baby in a corner, because the waiter can't see her. That said, I wouldn't dock them for this. The Staff works together and makes sure that your party isn't overlooked.The Food: They have a 5 course prix fix/ omikase for $40+3 for the dessert. I had the variety sushi, which was nice. The fish was fresh (I was there on Friday). They have a Sunday 20% off sushi special. I'm curious enough to break my no Sunday/Monday Sushi rule. Everything was pretty tastey, save the desserts. It was a green tea and peanut buttery mochi. If you need a little something sweet, it's ok for $3. I would skip it though if you were full.Why for dates: The staff performs a number of random ceremonies. There is one rice beating ceremony that occurs near the large tables. There is another thank you speech occurs in a very Japanese way at the sushi station. They also pass the sushi via oars to those that sit at the sushi tables. I like the whole concept of taking my food off of oars, even though you're essentially serving yourself. There's enough craziness going on that if you run out of conversation during the date, the restaurant provides it.",10,0.9952
967,8,5,4.0,"4.25 starsLook people, this is the BEST STEAKhouse! Go here and order just that, nothing more or you may be slightly disappointed. The filet mignon is the largest, most amazing steak I have ever had....and for a bargain price of $42 it was worth every red cent!! Warm olive and french breads was served to us first and what a great way to begin this feast. Both breads paired really well with the French onion soup. It was cheesy, full of onions and a nice taste of sherry at the end. When the main course came I though I died and went to heaven; a 16oz gigantic steak looking like a million bucks, just waiting to be devoured by a hungry little brown bear (me!) It cut like butter and inside was cooked to perfection; it literally melts in the mouth so chewing is optional but not required. We ordered the 3 for $24 side dish special to try a little bit of everything and this is where the disappoint lies. ""truffled"" Mac and cheese was almost an embarrassment to our table, it looked like Velveeta and there was nothing truffled about it. The Brussel sprouts were cooked with Canadian bacon and that smoked flavor was all I could taste. The mushrooms were really good but not hard to make at home if you wanted to. Next time I want to just order the Idaho potato purée and hopefully that changes my mind about the side dishes here. For desert we ordered a tiramisu. It was good but not the best I've ever had (@Johns on 12th) the waiter gave us some complimentary home made chocolate and vanilla ""ice cream"" thing wrapped in a fudge outside and a maraschino cherry on the inside. It too was good but I wouldn't order it unless I was craving ice cream which is rare. We must have had the best table inside the restaurant because I fell in love with the ambiance and the service was perfect too. The candle and red rose on the table is so romantic and pairs beautifully with the red velvet interior here. Guys, this date is sure to come with a happy ending ;)",8,0.9953
968,7,2,4.0,"Graffiti and Indian? The concept does not match but the food is amazing. I live on this block but have never made it here for dinner. Thanks to Hurricane Sandy, I managed to score a table for 4 on a week night without a hassle. It is such a hole in the wall place but it is worth it. We were seated right by the window and had not much elbow room so the seating is not very comfortable. Thankfully, I forgot all about the discomfort after food arrived. We ordered pretty much everything the waitress recommended. We started with their Green Mango Paneer and it has such an interesting flavor and texture that it really made an impression on us. I just really wish the dish is larger. The Zucchini Hummus Pizza is another great starter although it is not as unique as I think it to be. Their Braised Pork Bun with Apricot Chutney is excellent and has a sweet taste to it other than the typical tender pork juice. The Green Chilli Shrimp is refreshing and and the flavor is interestingly entertaining. We also tried all the desserts on the menu and I think the best is their Hazelnut Chocolate Chip Caviar. It is rich and creamy! The Strawberry and Pepper Ice Cream is not my favorite unfortunately. The dishes here are tapas style so you do need to order a good number of them to be satisfied. It is always fun to sample so many different dishes and try out various flavors and textures in one meal.",6,0.9961

So, I finally dragged my friend with me.This was during Fashion's Night Out, so it wasn't really that packed. Who wants to pay $8 a beer when they can get free glasses at participating stores nearby anyway, right? They only have three German beers on tap. I had the ""The Vixen"" and ""The Matador"" on the cocktail menu. SO SOOOOO GOOD! My friend had two beer tickets and got $8 worth of beer in huge mugs. She also had the BLT at the grill. The fries were soooo good. I think they may even be better than McD's fries. Shiiiiiiit. Since there is no bathrooms at the beer garden, you have to go through the Standard Grill that is connected, and downstairs. There will probably be a huge line though, cause from what I remember...there weren't many stalls. Oh, and while you wait...you can get your photo booth action on! (The machine accepts credit cards.

Tucked away in a little enclave within one of those concrete-outdoor-lobby-with-a-fountain-type areas that only Midtown attempts to pull off, you simply walk up to the counter, place your order, grab a table outside, wait for your name to be called out, and then slip into food-lovers-bliss. The menu is simply mouthwatering. I'm one of those dudes that loves to add weird shit to my sandwiches, and one amazing ingredient that I can't believe hasn't caught on yet is crunched up potato chips. Put them in your next PB&J and thank me later. I'm also a sucker for anything spicy, so when I studied the menu and landed on the 'The Dirty' - pepperjack cheese, caramelized onions, jalapenos, and crunchy potato chips - I had to try my hardest to keep my pants clean as I excitedly placed my order. I got it with tomato soup and a root beer - does it get better than that? HAYL no.The sandwich lived up to its billing and was absolutely bursting with flavor. Granted, it was greasier than a New Jersey-dude's-hair-on-a-Friday-night, but thankfully it tasted a little better than that. The tomato soup was spot on, and the tater tots with truffle mayo sauce were as delicious as they sound. I'll be back to try their fried chicken sandwich and tuna melt ASAP. Until then, I give this place more props than a high school play (I know, I'm hilarious). Keep doin yo thang, Melt Shop.",15,0.969
972,7,4,4.0,"Disclaimers: 1) it seems there are lots of virgins to Brazilian waxing who seem to have picked Hibba for their first time (and led to really scary reviews) and 2) my rating incorporates pricing and because Hibba has an amazing 2 for $40 Brazilian Wax special available until the end of the year via their website, the 4 star rating takes the unbelievable pricing in.Based on the reviews here, I was actually apprehensive of what Hibba might be like. What I do know is this: I've had brazilian waxes for years and have scoured the city for good deals/experiences/locations and have a pretty good idea of what constitutes a good/bad wax. Hibba is comparable to most places that I've returned to and with pricing like this, I'm going to keep on coming back. I arrived on a Wednesday at 6:15pm to find the place mostly empty except for one other customer getting her brows done. After filling out a basic form, I was introduced to my waxer, Neelam. She in turn ushered me into a tiny partitioned room. People were not joking about how small these tables/partitioned rooms are. At 5'3"", I alternated between banging my head on the wall to having my legs at the edge if extended. And even changing out of my boots/skirt, I had to be careful not to hit the hot container of wax. Space aside though, the wax itself was exactly what it should be. I don't know what reviewers who were crying out in pain were crying for. Maybe it was my waxer who was just better than the others (highly doubt it). Really, I think it has more to do with the fact that this is a brazilian wax and there's no such thing as a painless wax. Neelam was very quiet at first and almost afraid of my reaction to her waxing. She would warn me ""this is the very sensitive area"" (Uhm... all of it is sensitive but I appreciate the warning nevertheless). She was very competent and clean, never double dipping. And more importantly, she was very thorough. About halfway through, she actually commented that I was a great customer because I was so quiet (I guess if you're used to screamers, a normal person who just stares at the walls is a nice change). All in all, some of the reviews for Hibba are downright scary. The truth is that if you've had Brazilians before, you will be fine. Their usual pricing is well over twice what I paid and my rating would be a star lower if I had paid full price. This is not a spa and you should not expect a spa like atmosphere. The rooms are tiny and yes, if you end up in the first booth like I did, I can see where there might be flashing incidents. Having said that, I doubt their male clientele is very extensive and it really isn't anything another woman cares much about. Neelam was very careful coming in and out, trying to make sure no one was around, etc. If brazilian waxing is new to you, I recommend you try Eve (several locations in the city) or Avalon Day Spa for a more upscale first time. If you're looking for a local place with no frills and great deals, this is worth checking out.",23,0.9908
973,6,13,4.0,"I wouldn't call this place ""cheap"" especially if you're getting sushi. They have an omikase that is $40, which is certainly cheap for an omikase, but if u get an app or two to split or another roll to fill u up and a couple drinks u can easily hit $80 pp. Omikase is good but certainly not on the level (or price) as a Gari or Sasabune. They have an insane super omikase at $200+ pp which is intriguing if u feel like splurging. Make resos for omikase at the bar since its often booked by the weekend (omikase just isn't the same when its all plopped in front of u at the table simultaneously).The lobster tempura wasn't a wow. Prefer lobster unadultered. The uni ikaru oyster was phenomenal per others rec. Some mushroom on a stone cooked looked simple but tasted like butter - yum.

The space was open and bright (this was lunch, mind you). The food arrived quickly and was full of flavor. I had a special shrimp sandwich that isn't on the menu, which was served on foccaia bread with tartar sauce. The accompanying fries were crispy and well-seasoned. The ketchup even tasted homemade. For dessert my date and I split a slice of peach pie topped with vanilla ice cream. I think it would have been better if the pie had been warm, but it was still very good.My biggest complaint about Greensquare Tavern would be the noise. There were several crying babies that was ear-piercingly annoying.

It's rare that a restaurant this quaint, delicious and reasonably priced exists as far north as 140th st. and it's just my bad luck that there's no direct line of public transportation that goes across upper manhattan for me to get there more easily. Because honestly, their food is so good, and the service is pretty spot on too.Things at Trufa that rock:1. steak and eggs - great portion size, with perfectly cooked medium rare steak that's juicy and flavorful-- approaching $20 on a menu that rarely passes the ten buck barrier, but it was worth it. very, very good.2. tiramisu - just textbook delicious tiramisu. we thought we were full, but we couldn't help scraping every last smear of whipped cream, lady fingers and coffee-liquor soaked cake off the plate. such a great note on which to end our delicious meal. 3. home fries - normally, I tend to avoid home fries, but I couldn't get enough of these. where the normal home fry is dry, bland and overcooked, these were bursting with flavor, moist and delicious. a great side dish. 4. trufa poached eggs - yes, there's a pair of runny eggs and gooey melted mozzarella, but all things considered, this is a pretty healthy brunch dish. I mean, the rest of it is garlicky tomato sauce and some toast to mop it all up. All things considered, that's down right virtuous, as far as brunch is concerned. 5. buttermilk pancakes - sometimes I can't resist sweet pancakes. I know there are more of you out there. when sweet breakfast comes calling, these pancakes with mascarpone and fresh fruit are just the answer. just a great pancake, with real maple syrup. what more could you possibly want?The only thing (besides its could-be-closer-to-me proximity) that I didn't think was spot on was the side of sausage. We got some special meat (venison maybe? duck?) and it was a little greasy and not particularly breakfast sausage-y. Otherwise, there's nothing I would warn you off. Boyfriend had nothing but good things to say about the western omelet, and he got a free refill on his coffee. The waitress was super attentive and the food came quickly. Just a super pleasant experience all around. I've only been to Trufa for brunch, where it's just an awesome, low key delicious spot. They've got thoughtful vegan options, if that's your thing, and even though they do a brisk business, there's none of this scene-y ""let's wait two hours for a table"" nonsense.

979,8,7,4.0,"I was ready to visit one of my standard haunts in the West Village until fellow Yelper and friend Tricia K. suggested Negril Village. All she needed to say was ""There's really good Jamaican food nearby"" and I was sold!My memories of West 3rd Street are mostly older styled eateries. I still remember when just a store front down to the left was Pluck U. (now around the corner)! Negril definitely sets itself apart with a modern, dimly lit interior full of large, plush seating and pumping music that gives it a club like feel. Indeed, the lower level does house a more lounge oriented area, thus solidifying the connection to clubs and hip hop music.My friends and I were seated quickly. We got there around 7 ahead of a crowd which was great. Thanks to a Yelp check in deal, we also got a free rum punch with an entree, whoo! So how is the food anyhow? Thanks to all of us sharing, I was able to taste quite a few things! Let's see...CHICKEN CURRY ROTIA sweeter curry with perfectly tender chicken. The roti is different than what I'm used to from Indian or Malaysian restaurants. Instead of being crisp on the outside, it's much softer and more chewy, reminiscent of the bread at Ethiopian restaurants. I liked it quite a bit!GOAT CURRY ROTIThe rotis all use the same type of wrapper, but the insides are much different! The goat stew has a much deeper and savory flavor than the chicken curry. Also, be warned, this is literally goat stew in a roti wrap, so there are bones. I didn't mind however as it was just SO tasty, picking out a few bones was not a big deal.MANGO & GOAT CHEESE SALADThis salad had a wonderful blend of greens, onion, mango and goat cheese. We added on some jerk chicken for good measure and it was very tasty. The chicken was not overly done flavor-wise. It had jerk flavor, but it wasn't overwhelming. The chicken was also moist and tender. The lemon based dressing on the greens were bright and refreshing - fantastic stuff!RED VELVET CUPCAKEThis was an unusual red velvet cake as it was not slathered with cream cheese frosting. Instead, only a bit of frosting was put on top. The cake was allowed to stand on its own. As someone who thinks the cake should be the best part of well, a cake, this was wonderful. The top was a bit crisp but the bottom was nice and moist. Good flavor. Not the best red velvet either, but worth the price.RUM CAKEI am generally not a fan of rum cake, but I was curious to try Negril's to see if it was good and man was it ever! Most, tasty with a definite hint of rum, this was a really nicely done piece of cake, and quite a significant size (thank goodness I was sharing!).And yes, I had a free rum punch and it was good, though Tricia K. informed me if you order it (and not get it as a freebie) it's usually stronger. I found it sweet and refreshing, but it was low on the alcohol, but what do you want for a free drink?I had a wonderful time at Negril and hope to go back soon!",15,0.9989

The sun was setting, we were walking along the manhattan side of Roosevelt Island on the greenway from the fields back to the F train and Tramway station when we happened upon Pier NYC. I had read there was going to be a new seafood BBQ place set up along the water directly across the street from the subway stop, too easy not to find.We walked over and our group of 12 was seated immediately with four tables pushed together, fancy umbrellas overhead and the manhattan skyline perfectly beside us as we gazed up and down the East River depending on which side of the table you were on. The place closes at 9 pm on week nights so we got down to business and ordered two Patron margaritas per person. Frozen and on the rocks were both options. For $10 we were thrilled at the value to be had on old Roosev's Isle.I had heard that an ex Per Se man was in charge of the seafood so a number of us opted for the Striped Bass Ceviche, served in a plastic cocktail cup and accompanied by homemade tortilla chips. It was delicious. Everyone who ordered this seemed very satisfied, and it was without a doubt the furthest thing from fishy. I would definitely get this again sometime. I tried a few bites of the Beef Brisket and it was heavenly. Well marinated and juicy with a great charr to the outside without traipsing on carcinogenic or tough.The Barbeque shop is cash only, but the bar and menu items are all accepting of credit cards.

Basically, how seafood should always be cooked. It doesn't need a lot. Complement it, but let it breath and be itself. Prima understands this. The Artic Char and Sea Scallops are delicious, delicate, and most important, not overcooked. The cocktail list is created by the minds behind Summit Bar, which is a huge plus. Most of the menu drinks are based on clear spirits, like Gin and Pisco, so as to not overwhelm the seafood you are pairing it with. This works decently for the most part, especially with shellfish (as anyone who's ever been to a New Orleans style oyster/cocktail bar can tell you). Some of the most delicate fish might call for a more traditional wine based pairing though, if you care about that.Also, they have a great happy hour from 5-7 with 2 for 1 Oysters and Cocktails.

He is actually a really smart guy, in fact he denied to order that dish at first . But somehow after asking to the waitress for advice, a really charming, professional, attentive girl (and very pretty too) he had to order the French onion fondue. All for himself, overlooking the fact that cheese does not account among his better choices in life .. That should tell you, a lot, about the service. The guy tried his best. However, it didn't work.Of course. She wasn't impressed, just worried I believe, and once again that should tell you a lot about the service. Not only her, but the guy by the door is friendly and firmly control the crowd because this place my friend is extremely popular. Of course it is. Nevertheless, he survived and that was probably one of the best fondue he could have ever taste. See? since you are gonna sin, you better do it right. The melted cheese was in particular a Gruyere along with caramelized onions and it looks like it also contains thyme (although I didn't noticed it) in a rich beef broth with green apples, asparagus and toast bread to dip on it. The melted cheese was extremely moist and tasty, the green apple was actually perfect for that cheese. The best part and better than the bread I think. In fact, this Spanish girl who has never like fondue changed her mind after giving it a couple of tries. OK maybe more than a couple... schhhhhh The wines are excellent. It is a short menu but the ones I have try have become unforgettable. Should we think that loyalty can be consider absurd in occasions? The Bourgeois Pig has the ability to show in short why French wines dominate the world. Moreover, it's extremely and surprisingly affordable. Not only wines but beers are another strong option on the menu. Short, but strong. However, the wine is so good that I have always pass on their cocktails options even when those cocktails are a truly display of creativity that surely worth a try. Oh well, I will have to come back.Mussels and fresh mozzarella bruschetta were also winners and same with the fresh mozzarella tartine . All of this dishes seems to much to be order but just for one person. Therefore order your food to share. The presentation is also excellent. Simple, rustic and sophisticated at the same time. Thoughts on our the table were that it is a place for girlfriends gathering since there was a group of pretty girls seating in the most spacious part of the lounge. With vintage chairs and sofas, and surrounded on a red light that reminds to the most popular place for True blood characters. All this in opposite to the ""for dates"" area where you feel always extremely big no matter you are or not. There, intimacy is mandatory even when with the couples on the adjacent tables. Where light glows by its absence and where there is a high chance to success. Some wine, dim light while sharing a pot of hot melting cheese? .. it can potentially become dangerous. In fact, it is so dark in here that everybody looks amazing no matter what.

The location was previously occupied by Koryodang Bakery, once sort of a Landmark on 32nd Street. I didn't like Koryodang too much as the prices were sky high and the service wasn't too pleasant either so I am actually glad Tous Les Jours took up the place. The place itself is laid out well and has plenty of seats in the back just like Koryodang did. The prices are pretty competitive and similar to Paris Baguette. They have a wide variety of breads, rolls,Korean-French inspired pastries and baked goods, Ice Cream, Bottled Tea, as well as a section for Salads and Hero Sandwich items. They have a variety of drinks like the usual Coffee/Espresso-based Drinks, Bubble Teas, Smoothies, Iced Flakes, Fresh Fruit Juice and ""Ade"" as well as Herbal Teas.Some of the unique and different flavored drinks I saw were:Milk Tea, Taro, Honeydew, Strawberry, Jasmine, Coconut, Red Bean, Coffee Bubble Tea ($4.75)Red Ginseng Smoothie ($7)Blueberry Yogurt Smoothie ($5.50)Multi-grain Poder (Misugaru) Smoothie ($5.50)Mango Tango Flakes (Bingsoo) ($11.50)Fruit Iced Flakes ($11.50)Green Tea Iced Flakes ($10.95)Milk Redbean Iced Flakes ($10.95)Lemon Squash (???) ($4)Red Grape Squash (???) ($5)Peach Mango Jelly Smoothie ($5.75)Lemon Jelly Smoothie ($5.75)Not a bad start but I think they're still trying to figure out how to run/manage this place as it was pretty chaotic depsite so many people working there. However, definitely much much better than what Koryodang became throughout the years.**NOTE**-They call their ""Pat Bing Soo"" or Korean Shaved Ice with Azuki Beans, Mochi Rice Cakes, and Fruits dessert ""Iced Flakes"". The price is reasonable and the portion(??) is pretty big enough to share between two people. DO GET THESE during summer as it will be money well spent to cool you off instead of buying two Frappucinos at Starbucks!-For drinks, DO GET THE Lemon Jelly Smoothie!! Yes it's expensive at $5.75 but it was so refreshing (not exactly a Smoothie but more like Slushie/Slurpee and unique with Lemon Jelly pellets in them!!) -Breadwise---DO GET THE Walnut Cream Baguette ($4.50) which is F**KING good and yummylicious!!! NOPE, I don't think it's expensive for $4.50 when a tasteless stale pastry that's been sitting there for an entire day at Starbucks runs at $2.75+tax.

My husband and I were ""fashionably late"" ...over an hour! We were scolded by the hostess, who was, of course a pretty blond in her mid 20's, with a very thick Russian accent, dressed in nothing but black and red lace. At least she was nice enough to seat us immediately.In fact everything in this place is very Russian, as could be expected - the furniture, the dark green carpet, the decorations, the waiters, etc. I was extremely surprised to find out that their chef is an African-American. Now onto the food.The dinner rolls were cold. I had:Olivier - it was tasty and the saffron mayo was a nice touch. I have to say - my mom makes a much nicer version of this appetizer. She uses bologna or Canadian bacon instead of Kielbasa. The black bread was very dry and hard to chew.Beef Stroganoff - that's a long-time favorite dish of mine. And I was simply not impressed. The only good thing about it was the tender veal. (Ok, maybe some of the mushrooms too.) But the sauce had some overwhelming spice in it. It wasn't traditional. And did not like the taste at all. The pasta was overcooked, as other reviewers have noted. I'd never pay the full price ($35) for a portion of that particular . My husband had:Vareniki - they were warm and very tasty. The yogurt sauce was delicious. But the portion was tiny. He was only given 4 pieces. And a traditional Russian appetizer would consist of 8 or so. Chicken Kiev - this dish was just fine. I think the Buerre Noirsette (almond butter) was what gave it a distinctive taste. It's commonly used when preparing pastries. Desserts: Ptichye Moloko (Bird Milk) - it was very light and delicious. Bananas Foster - that's flambeed tableside. And it's absolutely worth it (even if you have to pay $18.) They show you all of the ingredients they put in it - butter, brown sugar, orange juice, brandy, bananas, vanilla bean ice cream. It's a relatively easy dessert to make at home. But it's fun to watch the preparation. And the end result is finger-licking good. The vodka shots we were served tasted like pure rubbing alcohol. We were told the vodka is Siberian and made from grain. The waiters need to cheer up a bit. They were professional, but very standoffish. Overall we had a nice experience. If I ever go back to Firebird, I'd only order some desserts and maybe try their in-house infused vodka types.",9,0.9954

The refrigerator section of composed side salads, made from scratch pastas, sauces and such made me wish it wasn't so damn hot out and made me want to enjoy cooking just a tad. I don't like olives, but even I was impressed with their olive bar and took a circle around it to admire all their offerings. I did the happy dance inside when I saw they carried Red Jacket juices and bought as much as I could carry. A package of quince paste made me smile and you know I snagged that as well. I pulled a number to order my sandwich but the sweet girl behind the counter let me know that you only pull a number if you want to order meats and cheeses. I went to Faicco's for a good ol Italian sub. I didn't see anything of sort on Murray's menu so I went the complete opposite direction aid ordered the Solstice. It read like heaven between two slices of bread. Goat cheese, fig spread, pecans, fried safe leaves. It had all the flavor profiles of a well thought out combo of ingredients. Slightly warn, rich, creamy, goat cheese. The fig spread was thick and sweet. The pecans added textures. The fried sage cut through the richness of the cheese and complimented the sweetness of the spread oh so well.Easy to get to off of nearly every subway line.

989,6,7,4.0,"2, maybe 3 words: [UNNECESSARY] SPICE GALORE.Back in the days when Mission was still the new kid on the block, my roomie sampled some food during the restaurant's private, soft opening for Friends & Family. However, she didn't immediately rush home and recommend it as the new, must-go place for food.Then the NYTimes ""ruined"" the restaurant for me by actually recognizing it... PUBLICLY. (See nytimes.com/2012/07/25/d…). NOOOOOO......!!!!!! (Darth Vadar style)Mission is now the new ""IT"" kid on the block, and all hungry restauranteurs are resigned to a wait, sometimes even a 2 hour wait. But there's the silver lining! You can drink free beer on tap while you wait! Enjoy every last drop of your beer. It'll be the LEAST spicy thing you consume before your taste buds die in a pit of fire.Segway-ing to the food. I would recommend the Pig Tails (they were hearty, rubbery, so obviously delicious), the Salt Cod Fried Rice (salty salty salty), the ChongQing Chicken Wings (they're just fried chicken, but the batter is amazing), and the Eggplant (no surprise here; I looooooove eggplant).Next time I would like to try the Sizzling Cumin Lamb Breast and the Bollito Misto alla Chinese --- the dish with all the ""strange"" meats in it --- sounds super yum.Ambiance - super tiny spaces! If you're not bumping into your dining partner, then you're bumping into the people at the next table. And if not them, then you're butting heads with the staff trying to maneuver around your inconveniently situated patoot. I'm kind of used to crowded conditions though, and I actually enjoy it at the right times. But, if you're one who needs personal space AT ALL TIMES, you might feel a bit claustrophobic here.I get the lure of Mission: nouveau Chinese with charitable undertones. 75 cents from every entree served is donated to the Food Bank for New York City. Thus, I would gladly come here with friends if they're on a Mission (ha!). But personally, if I'm craving unnecessarily spicy, Americanized Chinese food, I'd go that empty space in my apartment that I call ""the kitchen"" and whip up a mean mapo tofu and drink a bottle of sriracha with it.I'm wavering between a 3 or 4 star rating... but I'm feeling quite charitable today (zing!) toward this charitable restaurant ... so I will give it 4 stars!

Good alternative to the black sesame which can be a little intense at times (but is awesome in milkshake form). Almond cookie is light and simple.

They also have some items that aren't on the menu but can make for you, i.e. steamed bok choy w/garlic.Everytime I've gone into eat the place has never been packed, which leads me to believe that they make most of their money on delivery. I haven't ordered anything that I didn't like from here even items as simple as their avocado rolls. Not to mention that they lunch special prices make things more worth it.Oh, and when I dine-in the employees are overly nice. Not knowing how big the dishes were we ordered quite a bit of food. While ordering the server told us that we were ordering a lot, and tried to explain the size of each dish for us. It was very nice of him and let us know that he isn't just trying to take our money. In the end he helped us order the perfect amount of food.I must note though that when getting delivery from here it is best to go through seamless or grubhub or whatever other site. That way you've already paid for your food and all you have to do is sign the delivery paper and move on. The reason being that when I first started ordering from here the delivery guy was very rude and would hassle me for more tip. And no, I am not a bad tipper, but he ALWAYS wanted more. So unless you're the kind of person that tips $5+ for all orders, it is best to just pre-pay for everything, tip included.",7,0.9842
992,9,8,4.0,"I was here for the tail end of a day-long bachelorette party that started with a trip to several Long Island vineyards. By that time, I was pretty tired and had had my fill of drinking. But I was pleasantly surprised by the vibe of this restaurant/ lounge. I'd be lying if I said I could remember exactly what I ate because truth be told, the bachelorette party was a few years ago.What I can remember vividly was the enchanting decor that made me feel like I was Egypt, leisurely dining on yummy food (I think I had the tagine, but again I'm not positive) while enjoying some fun entertainment. As a latin and ballroom dancer myself, I have a deep appreciation for all types of dance. And since I did at one point begin taking belly dance classes (until my salsa instructor told me it would interfere with her teachings, but that's another story), I was all the more enthralled by the beauty with which Casa La Femme's dancers executed what I consider to be one of the most beautiful dances there is. I had mentioned the vibe earlier. It's difficult to put into words, except to say that your time at Casa La Femme will be a sensory experience from the moment you walk in. In the main dining room, the central seating area sits on a slightly sunken level, with a large fire pit serving as the focal point of the whole restaurant. Flanking this area on an elevated level are tables partially covered in organza-white tents, with hand-laid glass tiles on the floors and authentic Egyptian woodwork adorning the walls. The restaurant is filled with the smells of herbs and meats cooking, and though your dining companions are obviously super fun people, you'll enjoy the distraction when the music is pumped up and those dancers get out into the dining room, engaging men and women alike to create a communal sense of celebration. The one thing that marred my experience had nothing to do with the restaurant - I somehow managed to totally get screwed into paying $100 in a table of, like, 10 girls, even though I had an appetizer and entree with no drinks at all. Again, not the restaurant's fault, but when I do return, I'll be paying with cash ... and going with a smaller group.",9,0.9912
993,6,7,4.0,"I came here with one of those rare Groupons that seems too good to be true: $49 for two appetizers, two entrees and a dessert. I did a double-take when I bought it, as it includes all of the expensive steaks from the menu (except for the steaks for two).Naturally, I went for the Filet Mignon, which was $45 itself, practically the entire value of the Groupon. This was an excellent piece of meat. They also bring the piece of meat over to you for you to observe and approve it right before they start cooking it in the open kitchen near the back of the restaurant. The delicious scent of meat permeates through the whole restaurant, which just makes you salivate for your meal to start.We also got the Prime & Beyond Signature Burger (normally $15). This was one of the best burgers I've had - nice and simple, with a very sizable (7 oz.) patty on a buttery brioche bun, with a slice of American cheese. Probably one of the best no frills burgers available in the city. My only beef was with the fries, which were sparse both in quantity and flavor (very potato-y, but not in a good way, with not that much crisp).For appetizers, we got the Zesty Duck (normally $11), which comes with 7 or 8 delicious pieces of thinly sliced duck over some refreshing arugula, and the Prime & Beyond Filet Mignon Salad (normally $15, and $3 additional with the Groupon). This was another refreshing appetizer, with a couple strips of tasty filet mignon and some avocado.For dessert, we chose the Melted Caramel Cheese Cake with crystal sea salt (normally $8). I never really like cheesecake, but this was incredible. The combination of the thick, sticky caramel and the creamy cheesecake with saltiness added on top made this one of my favorite desserts.The atmosphere in here is also great, very dark and good for a nice date. The service was excellent, with very friendly wait staff, and lots of Koreans, which is always a plus when you are at a Korean establishment.I'll definitely be back, even without a Groupon, maybe for a quick solo meal, since the menu isn't particularly extensive, and there isn't so much more I need to try - but I do need to try that Burger Rice dish, which looks awesome.",13,0.996

If I want Healthy Japanese, I have to wait in long lines or forever at the counter. If I want Fast Japanese, it's definitely not healthy. If its Fast and Healthy, goodbye Tokyo. Well, not any longer.

Like any new restaurant, I know they are still working out some kinks on service and portion size. The owners are super nice and willing to strike up some good conversation.Standouts included the tender beef tri-tips, the asparagus wrapped in crispy bacon, and the sweet rice pudding balls. Sets of skewers are served over a bed of brown or white rice that catch some of the delicious house sauce (made with quality mirin and sake), topped with bonito flakes and served with pickled veggies on the side.

If you're a purist, you'll like- ain't nothing but soft penne, flagship cheese, garlic and some spice. I do prefer my Mac and Cheese with some crunch (a la breadcrumbs) but like I said, this is for the Purists. More gourmet than Smac, and very fun with the live cheese making that happens in the store!

Yet... I STILL want to give the place 4 stars and come back for more! That says something. (No one else in my group got sick. Still, consider yourself warned. I think it was the chicken paté...)I had reservations with a group of 6 for the Chef's Menu, which came out to $40/pp without drinks, tax, or tip. After looking at their regular menu, my health-minded low-carb self feared I wouldn't get my money's worth. I was so, so wrong. The waiter kindly asked for our dietary preferences and restrictions, and then it all just started coming to the table, a couple tapas at a time.... again and again. And when you think it's over, there's MORE... and THEN STILL MORE with the incredible dessert course (which, for us, was warm churros and chocolate dipping sauce and a flan-like ricotta dish with fresh berries). I highly recommend this Chef's Menu for group dining (which will also secure you a reservation - sweet!), just DO NOT fill up early on.Most memorable items were:Hanger Steak with chimichurri: Most tender cut of hanger I've had, and perfectly cooked - I'd eat this as a meal, with a side of the delicious wild mushrooms we were also given.Bacon-wrapped and cheese-stuffed dates: Loved by the whole table, these were so rich I could barely take a nibble without hating myself. Chicken paté on sourdough and topped with a sweet caramelized something: my first experience with paté prepared this way, and I loved the combo of flavors and textures. Sadly, this was the dish I recall most vividly as I was crouching in the street on my way home, but I'd give it another shot. It was THAT good.Roasted squid with frisée: I love non-fried squid. What can I say? It was perfectly prepared. I think I started clapping when I saw this coming to our table. The sangria menu RULES, particularly the ones spiked with the hard stuff.

1007,22,15,4.0,"Their price points may be out of whack relative to people's expectations of what Hummus and Shawarma should cost, but Al-Bustan might serve the best Lebanese food in the city. Frankly, I could care less about the Zagat rating (19-20 over the years) and that from folks that should be working off their tires. But, I am disappointed by the yelp average, and suspect it might well be impacted from perceptions from a prior incarnation. My own perception has actually changed dramatically for the better over the past few weeks. Initially, I couldn't be sure that they merited 4 stars. While, the entrees were good, the appetizers were hit and miss. In fact, the first time I ordered Batata Harra thinking they would be spicy, they lacked any seasoning, and my South African colleague had to liberally sprinkle salt to coax some life out of the potatoes. That said, he enjoyed the Grilled Kafta, as much as I did my Shawarma Lehme (Beef).My next visit was with a vegetarian friend, and the appetizers (Moussaka and Muhammara) lacked anything distinctive about them. However, the entrees were both excellent, with my friend ordering the Kibbeh Lakteen Bil Saniyah (baked pumpkin and cracked wheat stuffed with spinach and chickpea), and me ordering the Dajaj Bil Hamod (chicken sautéed in Lemon and Spices).By now, I had begun to appreciate the depth of the menu and the inclusion of dishes that I hadn't seen anywhere else in the city. And, then, I discovered Fares. This experienced server might seem distant to many, but he warmed up to me when I ordered the Moloukhia. With a glint in his eyes, he confirmed whether I did want the dish, and then beamed at my selection for I wasn't playing it safe with the Kebabs and grill items. A few minutes later a server appeared with 5 different containers: 2 containing chopped onions - one in lemon juice and the other in vinegar; one containing pita crisps, one containing rice, and another containing a stew with mallow leaves, chicken, and cilantro, cooked in garlic sauce. This was the best dish I've had lately, blending in different tastes and textures. It far outshone the Hummus bi Lahme (chickpea dip with sautéed lamb), which by itself merited 5 stars. My dessert selection was the Kunafa and it was a different melt-in-the mouth texture than the Palestinian and Turkish versions I've tried in the city. Convinced of the wisdom of listening to his advice, I have placed my selection at his hands ever since... something I rarely do. He's never let me down. While endorsing my selection of Arayes Bil Jibneh (toasted pita filled with Halloumi cheese) for appetizer, he walked me away from the Kouzy after describing its limitations. Instead, he asked me to order the Mahashi (Gray squash, grape leaves filled with rice and minced lamb with a tomato based gravy) - with the assurance that if I didn't like it, he's bring in anything else from the kitchen. You can't get that sort of money-back guarantee anywhere! His recommendation for dessert was the Muhallabia and that too was very different from similar versions I've tried in Lebanese and Israeli restaurants (that call it Malabi, often substituting corn starch for rice flour). The biggest differences were in the consistency and taste of the syrup, and in the small cheese pillows that accompanied the flan-like milk pudding.I don't see their lounge taking off anytime soon, and it's too big a space for the few (mostly Arab) customers that show up. But, it would be a crime if Al-Bustan were to shut down, for their Home Specials truly live up to their name. So, you might not be tempted to go in on a regular basis, but do keep them in mind for a special, and unique experience. Be bold, and go off the beaten track....",22,0.9939
1008,9,6,4.0,"Wait, I haven't written a review of Luke's Lobster yet? This must be corrected at once.I first encountered Luke's Lobster two years ago at my first Yelp event, Yelp Country Club at the Randall's Island (yelp.com/biz/yelp-countr…). They had a booth there, serving out fresh lobster rolls. They immediately caught my eye because I went to high school in Maine and have enjoyed many a delicious lobster from that cold, northern state. Since then, I have visited Luke's Lobster numerous times, especially now that I live in East Village. And what can I say? I love their lobster rolls. Succulent and so very fresh, I could probably eat two or three of them in one meal. The warm toasted bread and the butter applied to the lobster meat makes for a combination that brings a person comfort. I love Luke's Lobster.",9,0.9743
1009,6,4,4.0,"I admit that Shangri-La is my go-to place for a quick bite around here. Their buffet bar is my ticket to getting my daily vegetable intake out of the way, and actually has a good array of veggies, including kale, kimchi, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, and more.Their sandwiches are also a great value, at under $6 each, and are always made with quality ingredients (soft, fresh rolls, Boar's head deli meats, variety of cheeses like BRIE!!!, everything made to order). While I wish there was a better veggie-to-meat ratio (eat your veggies, people), I'm sure the abundance of protein stuffed in each sammie will please the majority as it's really a bang for your buck. While no particular sandwich stood out for me, every one I've ordered have been very satisfying, so you can't really go wrong. Their offerings of avocado (I refuse to call it guacamole as I'm from southern California, and guacamole doesn't exist in WaHi) and pesto makes each 'wich all the more exciting. Oh, and the Wednesday kalbi sandwich special is overrated; opt for the other choices instead.My favorite part...they carry all my ""bougy"" drinks! They have Honest Tea, coconut water, POM, and a variety of ""antioxidant-rich"" (whatever that means) drinks here. If you are/will be living in Washington Heights for a while, Shangri-La is a dependable eatery to add on to the list.Tips: - Call in your sandwich order if you're in a hurry at noon, or you will be standing around forever. - The array offered at the buffet ceases to exist around 2pm, so come earlier or you'll be stuck with leftover meats and fried rice. - The place closes at 6pm weekdays, and 4pm weekends, so only count on it if you're having an early dinner.",7,0.9895
1010,8,7,4.0,"1 + 1 = 4.Take any item on Maoz's salad bar and you can't complain. Decent falafels - they stick to the rules, fry them till crisp and yet it stops short of greasy. The hummus is ordinary, with nary a flavour other than chickpeas and tahini. Their salads are fresh and mildly seasoned. My favourite items on the bar are the tabouli salad, with its lovely minty flavour, and the yogurt sauce.For a value meal here, you can't go wrong with the falafel sandwich. Perhaps its more expensive than the carts in the street, but it's surely fresher, healthier and most importantly tastier. For the best distribution of toppings and sauces through your sandwich, use your hands to press the pita together and crumble the falafels. So all those goodies can settle into the nooks and crevices of your sandwich, instead of being left with this falafel party at the bottom after you've eaten your way through the toppings. The salad box seems like a worse deal at first, but then you haven't seen the way I pile on my veggies on that thing - the floor of the box all but cracks under the weight.The service is always friendly and their juices are healthy and delicious.And this is the most important part: Each individual item in my huge piled up sandwich or salad box is strictly in the ordinary to good range, but somehow together (assisted by helpings of the green sauces and the yogurt dressing) the whole meal is just so much better than the sum of its parts.",11,0.9902
1011,7,5,4.0,"By the time that I scored the super secret reservations to this place, I was already over the hype...which of course meant that I ended up being quite pleasantly surprised.First of all, I had it burnt into my brain that this was a smaller version of the milk bar in Kubrick's film of A Clockwork Orange with similarly dressed but not psycopathic individuals with Eyes Wide Shut masks in a very black space dominated by glassy decorations. I also thought they'd have piles of exotic fruit, spices, and elixirs behind a bar.My date and I located the unmarked door quite easily. What gave us pause was how the hell to announce our presence. Completely at a loss, I knocked feebly. Almost instantly, a young gentleman opened the door, nodded, and whisked us inside.We were seated in a cozy, rounded corner couch at our own round table rather than at the small bar. From then on, we barely even looked at the present company, and just got drinking. A bartender came up to us and interviewed us about our preferences. I mentioned my admiration for the Ramos Gin Fizz and got a light, zesty citrus drink. Definitely fresher tasting and less sweet than just about any other drink of that category that I'd ever had, but a part of me was sad that they hadn't actually shaved the lemon peel and juiced the fruit in front of my very eyes.By the time we'd almost drained our highball glasses, a female server appeared and asked what we wanted. This time, I kept stressing a peach taste with cream but something neither sweet nor Schnappy. Server disappeared, and came back with a concoction featuring fresh cream. THIS was where it was at...if I could capture any fully realized essence of M&H and its philosophy, I'd say it's in this fresh cream, whatever is meant by fresh (didn't see a cow anywhere)....The space was unremarkable to the vision. It was old, dark, and dimly lit, oriented lengthwise so that there wasn't all too much other than the bar, a narrow thruway, and a wall with jackets hanging on hooks. But there was something about the air of the candlelit space - something so old that it felt almost Western (as in Gold Rush era saloon Western, not that I was alive back then).As I got more and more buzzed without even realizing it, I started meditating on how the Lower East Side basically WAS the original wild wild West (just read Luc Sante's ""Low Life""), and how I was probably breathing the same air as poets, gangsters, cops and drunks from that time...and it tripped me out. The server came back with a handwritten tab for $84. Here, I had to put my foot down. ""We had three drinks not four, y'see?"" I snarled (not really). She apologized not too profusely, and came back with an adjusted tab for sixty-something bucks. Much better.The drinks were delicious, the privacy was excellent, the space was spooky, and the price was all good in exchange for the former three elements...but if I could do it all over again, I would have consumed more water. The drinks, fresh and clean as they were, didn't burn very clean in my system...I was pretty much hungover by the time I got home. My conclusion is that Milk & Honey isn't overhyped or underhyped. Bizarrely, it's like the nation of India - a uniformly dehydrating love-or-hate experience that's different for everyone depending on what you do, when you go, and which regions (in this case, of flavor) you visit. That said, you'd be a fool not to go there at least once. And don't listen to what anyone says before you go.",7,0.9914

Come with a date or a friend or two - not your sorority.The music was the perfect volume. Is that a weird observation? Not so loud that you can't hear the person across from you (talking loudly), not so soft that it becomes background noise.Despite the DJ's unpromising Black Flag t-shirt, I was really feeling the music! A sampling: Ace Frehley, The Strokes, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros ...Um, there might have been some Smiths thrown in there.

We just missed it, so most beers (tap/bottle) were $6, cocktails $7. I think $20 minimum for credit. Shrug. My one real complaint is that even though it was a healthy size, my gin and tonic was not very strong at all. Here are some unnecessary qualifiers:- If I came here again and they were playing Top 40 or god forbid dubstep, the mental disconnect would probably drop them an entire star. - In this intimate, low-key bar, the crowd could make or break it.

1014,8,4,4.0,"Another great Restaurant Week experience!For $24.07 (what's with the $.07 anyway?) you get a three-course meal. There were quite a few options for both appetizers and mains. I know many places seriously limit the menu, but that wasn't really an issue here. Only three dessert options, though.I started with the white anchovy bruchetta. It was good but not amazing. My co-worker swore by the salt cod croquettes, so I'd probably get that if I were to visit again. For my main course I opted for the pork chop, which isn't something I order a lot. But this one was really good. Salty. Juicy. Nicely charred. Quite decadent. And great. One co-worker had the croque monsieur, which is essentially a fancy ham and cheese sandwich. Looked good, but pretty simple. My other co-worker had the halibut, which was drastically under-seasoned. I could just see the judges on Chopped blasting the chef for not using enough salt. For dessert I had the chocolate panna cotta, which is like a creamier version of chocolate pudding. Restaurant Week may have its flaws, but it's a great way to get into some nice restaurants to try new things and not break the bank. Count me in.",8,0.9901

I was usually already pretty damn drunk, and you knew it, yet you still took advantage of me, amoral temptress that you are. You've got the full package. You're easy to get into. You never ask me to pay. And just when I think I should try something new, you curl your finger, purr, and, sucker that I am, I always come back for more. Ok, groan-inducing innuendos innu-ending...now.I've ended up at Solas at least 15 times in the past 6 months. I have no idea how or why, but somehow, Solas is the end destination for every damn 20something I know in this city. I'm pretty sure half my med school class has had their birthday party here, and my friends from all other walks of life have each at some point texted me excitedly, 'You won't BELIEVE it but I found this awesome place with no cover, a bunch of bars, and a big ass dance floor all in the same place!! It's called SOLAS!'Goddammit, I know. I know. You can't really fault Solas herself for that, especially because she's got everything you'd want - as mentioned above, there's no cover and there's usually no problem with bouncers or lines. She's got a nice long bar on the left side with some seating in the back. A step through the archway on the right opens up into a spacious dance floor with a second bar, while a quick walk upstairs reveals a THIRD bar along with 2-3 loungey areas. Nice. Drinks are all under $10 and served speedily. The crowd's a good mix of young, attractive folk. There's literally not a thing I can complain about.But my god, if I wind up here ONE more time in the near future, I'm gonna bring a mattress, some pillows, a jar of crunchy peanut butter, maybe a few books, and just freakin move in.

It's like marrying Mila Kunis and realizing that much perfection every day gets boring for some unexplainable reason.

1016,4,4,4.0,"I am a huge fan of Bloomspot, which if you're not familiar with the site is a more upscale Groupon or Living Social. I like getting great deals at places that otherwise are quite pricey, ie expensive salons or dinner at Dovetail on the UWS. Upon seeing a Bloomspot last month for Firenze that included appetizers, dinner and champagne for two at the price of only $59, I figured I should buy it and hang on to the deal for a date night with Mike sometime. This was a good decision.Fast forward to a couple Saturdays ago, we decided to give Firenze a try. The room is small and dimly lit. It was busy both with other couples and groups of people out on the town. The service was quite attentive and the food was very good. I started with a salad and had the ravioli for my entree. I played it safe but was impressed nonetheless. The champagne was a fun treat that made the night feel special.

The mix of music that they play here leans heavily on the hip hop side, and the bar can be more on the lounge-like side on a weeknight (we were once the only party there) or butt to butt busy on a Friday or Saturday night. There are loads of mismatched couches and seats if you can grab a spot - although it's more difficult on the weekends.The true true true reason that I love this place?

1018,5,2,4.0,"The Bugs I reviewed seems to have disappeared... here it is again.I read about Bugs a few months ago. An East Village Japanese restaurant by a Korean female chef who grew up in Japan and trained at Sushi Yasuda and Jewel Bako. That alone was enough to pique my interest, let alone the name ""Bugs."" So, when I learned this afternoon that Bugs had opened this past Wednesday, I decided to take myself out on a date, worked out to make some room in my tummy, then strolled over to this brand new spot.I walked in around 7:10 to find the place nearly empty. It was just the chef (looking trendy in a beret and a plaid shirt that had ""SURFSTAR"" written across the back) and the two women who worked there. Nine seats around the counter and three small tables against the wall. It was an intimate space that reminded me of the set up at Cocoron, as I had just been there two days ago. I grabbed a seat at one end of the counter. One of the women brought me a menu. She also apologized and explained that they didn't yet have a liquor license. It wasn't a deal breaker for me and, in the 90 minutes that I was there, it didn't deter anyone else from staying either. There were two tasting menus available, one at $45 and the other at $60. I chose the latter, which was the same as the former except that it included both the fish and the meat, rather than a choice between the two, and a hand roll with the sushi course. The meal started with edamame and a shot of chilled tomato & tofu soup. These were like amuse bouche. Edamame was edamame, although the plum salt spiced it up a bit. And the soup tasted like a health shake with soy and V8. It got a bit more interesting with the salad course, listed as ""mushroom salad"" on the menu. I'd say it was more like watercress salad in zesty dressing, with mushrooms, served in an old fashioned glass. These first three courses were followed by a small plate of sashimi. The salmon and sweet shrimp were good. But the tuna seemed slightly sub-par. Then came what I thought was the highlight of the meal--pork belly with mashed potatoes. Granted you can't really go wrong with pork belly, the dish was still delightfully delicious and delectably well-balanced. The mashed potatoes were Asian style--like, not totally mashed and a bit mayo-y than buttery.. i.e., a cross between mashed potatoes and potato salad. It was accompanied by needle-like pieces of gobo chips which added a great crunch to the dish. Knowing how much I enjoyed this dish, the chef assured me the next one would be just as good. I didn't love the snapper as much as the pork belly though. It was served with sea urchin sauce, which she torched, along with broccoli rabe and beets. If you order this a la carte, the menu says you can order rice and soup on the side. The bitterness of the broccoli rabe and the sweetness of the beets balanced out the saltiness of the snapper. Rice and soup would probably complement the dish to make this a good stand alone meal.The last course was the plate of sushi and the hand roll. Each piece of sushi was served with its own complementary garnish. The scallop, for instance, was served with rock salt and orange zest, and I thought it was delicious. The fluke and the salmon roe were also good. As with the sashimi dish though, the tuna in the hand roll was not my favorite, although it was paired with my favorite herb, shiso.Overall, I thought it was a great meal. By the time I left, the restaurant was really starting to fill up and a party of four was asked to return in a half hour. This isn't really a sushi place. In fact, you can't order sushi a la carte... only as part of the tasting menu. And remember, the place is small. There isn't a kitchen in the back or anything. What you see is the entire restaurant. A blender, a torch, a couple hot plates, a microwave... it really is very intimate. I'm not even sure where they would store the alcohol if/when they get their liquor license!",13,0.9963
1019,19,16,4.0,"It looks to me like Korea Spoon is targeting a different type of clientele. But don't judge the book by the cover. I am not talking about the prototypical Western meet East and vice versa even when the looks and many of the patrons can trick you. I actually think more of a sophisticated dinner type, you think of it: family occasions or business will fit quite well but don't think on a very formal occasion, neither high scale because it does not feel like that either. Casual dining can happen on a beautiful space too. I am curious to see how the look affects their business. It is chic, very modern and spacious. Trendy from the floors to the ceiling to the servers. Even the dinnerware breaths on style. What do you think? my Korean friends said it is too fancy for many Koreans/Asians to get in there. I don't like to make this kind of assertions because I think I am being disrespectful. But that may explain the mixed crowds. Because under the view of a tourist, generally Caucasian, I remember to be fascinated but quite intimidated also of KTown several years back on my first visit to New York. Who would have tell I'd become one of the most frequent visitors nowadays. At any case, when you don't know, you will surely choose Korea Spoon. But here is the difference. Even if you know, it will be an excellent choice. I like it and feel clean, chill out and really pleasant. I am bringing my parents here next time they come to visit. Besides the looks, this baby is not only pretty but the food is pretty good too. There is 2 separated areas and a couple of private rooms. While downstairs you can get regular menu, upstairs is reserved for BBQ.The menu is large, a good representation that focus on Jjigaes (stews) and Bimbimbop. In the few occasions I been there, have never try their BBQ so that I can't tell you. I think that will be next. Apparently, they will be getting their liquor license in one week. If that is what you are waiting for, just wait a little longer. Its coming. I love their banchan and the spiciness and overall taste is right on point. That's what I mean about not being trick. There is no try to adapt to Western palates but rather the food is quite similar to their neighbors. Similar or even better. Outstanding dishes for me are their Dolsot BimBimbop, either with seafood or just octopus. I absolutely love it. And also the tofu Jae Yook kimchi bokkum (spicy pork and Kimchee stir fry served with firm tofu). I love this dish too. Probably more than others. My Saengtae jjigae (pollack fish, mushrooms and tofu stew) was really good. As well as their pig feet as appetizer. I know it is not the most popular dish, but I do like it and its better than the times I had it at Gam Mi Oak. By the way, looks like we will be attending a battle for the best Seol Leong Tang (ox tail soup) because no one could beat Gam mi oak on this. I like the broth better there, however Korea Spoon does a much better job with the meat they use. The noodles goes to Gam Mi Oak . Soon Dubu was ok , but not bad. Order it if you are in the mood for it. However, their cold noodles were pretty good too and I'd order them. I have taste also seafood Panjeon (pancakes) and it is excellent. Among meats, their bossam (steamed pork with lettuce wrapping) it is been very good but as I said, can't tell about their BBQ. Looking forward to hear what you think of it. The service is excellent and very attentive. Once we weren't Koreans in the table and so they explained to us what was every dish and how we should eat it. I liked that a lot. You can order repeated times more banchan and water and tea glasses are refilled continuously. I am walking on a cane this days and they still show me and help me out when I am in my way to the ladies room. I like that a lot too. Last time I went on a large group dinner and at the end of the meal we were granted with fruit platters on the house. And presented in such a cute way. You know, carved fruit and a carrot on a beautiful butterfly shape. Like the one appears on The Rooftop Prince. Maybe they wanna follow the trend on this also. You should watch it by the way. How not to gain us with that. Girls, this is cute and you will love it. They are working hard to make business and honestly I like that very much too. But the food speaks by itself. They gain me for many reasons already. And I will definitely come back .",24,0.9995

She had only been here for wine, but said it was great for a date, so off I went. Dark entrance, dark bar, dark stairway, dark red walls, oh so mysteriously charming. I made reservations online, just in case. The place wasn't too crowded, but the host asked if I had reserved a table. Why do they do that when there's plenty of space on Tuesday night? Thankfully, I made a reservation through their website and we were sat at a cozy table at the window on the second floor. Overlooking 52nd St, and being tucked away from everyone else made the experience better. There's just something about being hidden in a dark corner in an unfamiliar place with someone. There was French music playing softly in the background and the waiter was so attentive. So attentive that he leaned WAY in while we ordered. I could smell his breath. I wasn't bad, but strangers shouldn't be so close. I wonder if he spoke English? He did a lot of nodding and smiling and pointing at the menu, and I do not recall him speaking at all. It added to the charm. We ordered the grilled octopus salad to start, along with wine of course. The salad was good, fresh arugula, perfectly grilled cephalopod, not chewy at all, with a little char. Yum. I had the beef/lamb/feta burger. It was cooked to order, but they're a little stingy with the cheese. Date had the braised short ribs over French lentils, looked like a delicious stew from across the table. Then there was dessert...Holy creme brulee. I'll do you one better- Holy FREE creme brulee, for both of us! It was amazing! Perfect texture- creamy/sweet. Perfectly flamed crunchy/caramel top, and a nice espresso layer under all that cream. Apparently Tuesday is ""couple's night"" and they give you dessert if you RSVP through their website. So, grab your BF/GF, log onto OKCupid, borrow the neighbor's dog, or take your grandma to a nice dinner. Show up as a pair and get yourself some FREE and fabulous creme brulee!",27,0.9988
1021,11,10,4.0,"I've contemplated this review for a good six months now, since I've realized It Has Been A Really Long Time Since I've Written a Review (And Now, Even Longer). I had this hilarious analogy on how it's like getting back on the saddle for the first time, but I scrapped that idea when I wound up in France for the summer, thinking that my comeback would be even more glorious if I wrote a review of a French place in French. Well, after ten weeks, all I can say is what I knew when I came to France: ""Voulez-vous couchez avec moi?"" and ""Mon dieu!"" While I'm sure I could write a review with that (if I walked into a store saying the former, and it resulted in the latter utterance), I believe that length as well as substance matters.My really witty analogy had something to do with how it's sweet and hard and...not an accurate description of Molly's Cupcakes. I had been sent to Molly's by a Houston Yelper, he who loves cheesecake, with the request that I try the blueberry cheesecake cupcake and let him know how it was. I got lost on the way there (because my mental Google Maps is actually a Yahoo! maps, and I assume otherwise), but the blueberry cupcake made it worth it. It was a vanilla cake filled with cheesecake cream (or whatever form it took to get into the cupcake's center). The cheesecake filling made it pretty fabulous, but my favorite parts were the cupcake top, which was moist and of the texture of a good banana bread (where, if some had gotten stuck on the top of a bakery box, you'd be scraping it off and delivering it to your mouth), and the graham cracker crumbs, which were nice, solid blocks of sugary goodness.Molly's is by where I live, so I've been back on many an occasion. The regular cupcakes (i.e. the standard cake + frosting on top) are pretty good, though I prefer Georgetown Cupcakes for the standard formula. But, you can choose your cake (chocolate, carrot, red velvet, banana, and vanilla), your frosting (vanilla, chocolate, cream cheese, french buttercream, and brown butter--brown butter wins at EVERYTHING), and toppings (m&ms, chocolate chips, gummy bears, ice cream, brownie chunks, etc.). The best part is the station to the side where you can dump as many sprinkles on the cupcake as possible, because, as in the case where I got a birthday cupcake for someone, nothing says I love you more than making it rain on a cupcake.The other filled cupcakes are pretty fabulous. I also adore the creme brulee, with that soft chewy top, a creme filling, and a bruleed top (one day, I am going to open up a bakery where I take things and brulee everything in it, from cheesecake to plasticware--this is a place where you eat with your hands). The peach cobbler is also a good approximation of its namesake, with a peach puree filling, brown sugar streusel, and whipped cream topping. There are seasonal cupcakes, such as the pumpkin spice. It is also my favorite, because 1) where can you go wrong with a mascarpone filling, and 2) the cupcake top is less soft and slightly crisp at the edges, which goes nicely with the cream cheese frosting.The interior has, by the counter, wooden swing-type chairs (the top and bottom are attached to the ceiling and floor, lest sugar-crazed individuals decide to try some Cirque du Soleil moves). There are also several wooden tables and chairs, along with an array of board games.Overall, the regular cupcakes work in a pinch, but the center-filled cupcakes are good facsimiles of desserts in cupcake form. It's like having a compact, travel-friendly dessert without having to share. Sharing is overrated anyway--sharing might be caring, but before you love others, you must first love yourself.",9,0.9984

I was coaxed into singing some old school Madonna hits and Moon River with the 70 year old birthday boy, and I have to say it was fun and one of the most relaxing group audience karaoke experiences I have ever had.I am coming back to this small little karaoke gem, bring your posse, take over the front room!! Its pay per song so you can put your song in the queue and stay as long or as little as you'd like! They also have half priced drinks during certain hours.... to help you get your confidence up!!!",8,0.9951
1023,8,6,4.0,"Now Serving: The Best drinks in Harlem.Ginny's is a throwback. It's a tweaked recreation of a Harlem Supper Club from the post-WWII era of American Idealism. Everything from the drinks, the decor, and the food is designed to transport you to a different time... a time when we sure loved the shit out of everything ""oriental"", Americanized the hell out of it, and live jazz and a good cocktail after work was a God Given right. You know, if you had the money.And so it goes with Marcus Samuelson, ever tweaking comfort foods from 50 years past and charging a whole lot for them. The food here is a mix of Harlem comfort foods like the Bobo Chicken & Waffle (which is excellent), standard 50's dinner club fare (Steak, Lobster Thermidor) and throwback Americanized Asian food like 5-Spice Duck with Scallion pancake (just one itty lil' bitty one!) and Maitake Dumplings. Most of these dishes are solid (like the duck). Some of them are even border on excellent (Bobo Chicken). Some are total flops (Artichoke Croquette, seriously my friend basically spit it out back into the bowl). Just like upstairs though, pretty much none of them are worth the money. The portions are insultingly small (like the Shrimp and Walnut), and this from someone who both eats small and spends a lot of money on food. All that said, the bread basket is a winner (really, no sarcasm), and the desserts are downright awesome. Now I know, this doesn't sound much like a 4-Star review (it's not, I'm going with a cop-out-rific 3.75 Stars. Stop judging me. Stop it right now.) That said, this place has a few excellent things going for it...First, the drinks here are the best uptown has to offer right now. Dave, a former Death and Co alum has taken charge as head barkeep down stairs. The drinks are much better than upstairs in Red Rooster, and also cheaper. The Harlem Mule is excellent, and I also loved their tweaked Sazerac that's infused with Caraway. Just be careful though. They do not include all the ingredients on their cocktail list, and quite a few of the drinks you think are stirred actually have citrus in them and are shaken.Second, the live jazz cannot be highlighted enough as a reason to come here. It really makes this place. Will return when in Harlem. Not sure if I'd go out of the way though.On THE LIST:yelp.com/list/best-cockt…",6,0.9935

Yes you would.I was introduced to MitchMallows at a Yelp event in Queens (the now famous Summer Stunner!). Free samples of food everywhere, and, of course, I had to go for dessert first. Trays of colorful confectionary blocks drew me in immediately. Flavor tags reading ""Cremesicle"", ""Wasabi Ginger"", and ""Pretzels & Beer"" made me scratch my head with a happy curiosity.I partook.I was pleased!I will admit, marshmallows are not ""my thing"". Even as I advance in my years, I still have these food texture quirks that haunt me from my childhood. However, a handcrafted marshmallow trumps a prepackaged, mass manufactured one any day of the week. It's a lighter and spongier texture that's simple fresh.Not to be selfish and try them all, I only tried a few flavors but was pleasantly satiated. My friend Lori and I tried the special churro flavor, which was divine. Literally, on the train ride to Queens, we had been discussing how we wished a churro seller would happen to walk up and down the aisles of the 7, because we had a craving. I'm not religious, but the fact that a churro marshmallow was being showcased might have been divine intervention. I also went for the banana and chocolate flavored marshmallow. That is a flavor combination you can not go wrong with! My friend partook in other flavors available and, admittedly, we showed up to the MitchMallows both MORE than once by night's end.Mitch, keep on makin' those mallows!",13,0.9895

Actually the bartender must have loved us because we got an extra half hour or so for free, yay.The tapas platter consisted of:Patatas Braviolis - Good, but typical.Meatballs - Interesting but they didn't blow me awayGernika Peppers over Croquetas de jamon - I actually really liked the peppers, it was different but the croquetas I could pass on.Empanadillas - Fried, good.. With the unlimited sangrias, there was no way these little dishes were going to fill us. So we ordered ...Sandwich de jamon - This one was the most disappointing. Maybe because I was craving the ones from Spain.. It's supposed to be all about the bread (baguette) and this was buttery toast, like a grilled cheese.Txistos - I like! Little sausage links deep fried in wonton like wrappers.Earth dessert - The bartender recommended this and said it was really cool because it literally looks like dirt in a playground. Well, it literally does look like a pile of dirt haha, not sure what's so cool about that but it tasted good!I mean they're your standard tapas, I can't say honestly anything was too spectacular, I think you pay for more of the visual presentation of the food, but good nonetheless.",8,0.9937

People there are super friendly, mostly early 30s and up professionals getting off work. The space is gorgeously decorated. It definitely stands out in an area full of irish style pubs.

Very good, even if a tad expensive at $33.Gotta love the waitress; when I was having a moment of austerity and about to opt for the beet salad instead of the foie gras (which was pretty magical, I should add), she told me that I was making a mistake, that I couldn't possibly opt for something that wasn't artery clogging at a French restaurant because ""every dish starts with a stick of butter.""

They have a long bar in the begining and seating is available in the back. They have a very dim light in the background and all the servers are dressed as if they are straight out of a Hawaiian beach resort.They got a pretty exhaustive menu and they have so many options. I was so confused after having a look at the menu. After seeing fellow yelpers sipping out of a big bowl we decided to order the same drink. That was a scorpion bowl and since it was during the happy hour we got it for happy hour price. Trust me that bowl looked like as if it would have less alcohol and more fruit juices but damm that bowl had so much alcohol. After couple of sips one definitely gets a buzz.

1034,19,16,4.0,"Despite popular belief, New Yorkers are never adamant to welcome the extreme weather conditions allotted to each cardinal point of the solar system, be it deep summer or deep winter. In fact, such natural polarities are met by corresponding activities and treats; be it the ubiquitous sight of city dwellers slurping their bubble-teas in the summer, or the same crowd slurping their ramen or udon noodles in winter. On that note, if you happen to be craving just that on the next freeze-over (which means any day now we hope), you can head out to St. Marks Place, where amongst the myriad of options that abound for Japanese ramen or udon, Kenka stands out for having the unique distinction of being the sole purveyor of cotton candy and bull private parts alongside your ramen order. Yes, that wasn't a euphemism; bull private parts.Since I'm confident you haven't seen many USDA packages of the said phallus at your local supermarket, this is possibly one of the rarest appetizers you can sample alongside your katsu don or ramen. All kidding aside, this Japanese delicacy is served with a very pungent ginger-miso sauce with a mustardish undertone which accounts for most of the flavor, since the genitalia itself tastes rather neutral, kind of like cartilage. If that's your sort of thing, then by all means give it a try, at least to earn bragging rights (of the self-deprecating kind, that is).But if such anatomical parts prove too extreme for your palate and you still want to partake of something equally adventurous, the menu carries yet another item originally designated for reproduction: Turkey balls. Again, that wasn't another euphemism: turkey balls.Of course, Kenka realizes full well that the power of association might prove too jarring for some customers with a delicate taste, and that's why they've installed the cotton candy machines at plain sight, so that you can treat yourself with the sweet puffy stuff just in case you didn't like these overly exotic platters, and to make sure you'll return.Leave it to the Japanese to come up with such amusing juxtapositions.",18,0.967

1036,23,14,4.0,"What do you eat if you're stuck in the Mount Sinai area, tending to a relative? Your trusted yelp app would identify Falafel Express as a 4 star option, though trial should confirm that it is the best value for a 2 star meal (a falafel sandwich, curly fries, and a can of coke for $ 6). Other options include Moustache Pitza, (another two star experience), the ""100% Mexican"" El Aguila, or the jazzier Taqueria, El Paso that has a full drinks menu. So, what do you do? I went with the saying: ""Para Todo Mal, Mezcal, y Para Todo Bien, Tambien"". Or, (for everything bad, mezcal, and for everything good, as well.)Mezcal may not be as popular as Tequila, and the tradition may be to drink it straight not with cocktails, but damn, you will get a few fine drinks at El Paso featuring Mezcal including Oaxacan Gold (Cilantro, Pineapple, Mezcal) and Cucumber Smoke (Mezcal, Lime, cucumber, worm salt). The dexterity with which El Paso rounded out the drinks menu including the expected Cerveza, Agua Frescas, Jugos, Sangria, etc. was the first sign that El Paso is not leaving any space uncontested.That's what fascinates me most about El Paso - both as a culinary enthusiast, and as a student of positioning and differentiation. While NYC is liberally sprinkled with Mexican dining options including Taco Trucks, Mexican Delis, Taquerias, upscale chains like Dos Caminos, mass Mexican impersonators like Chipotle, and high end restaurants like Rosa Mexicano, Maya... I've yet to come across a Mexican dining restaurant that can take bite sized chunks from all competitors. Serving a full course of options starting from Nachos (hello Dos Caminos), to Tacos (2 for $ 6.50, not $ 14 as in the Mayas of the world), Cemitas (Puebla style sesame seed buns, Oaxaca Cheese, Papalo, avocado, chipotle pepper, meat) and Tortas (Mexican sandwich bread spread with refried beans, mayonnaise, with lettuce, tomato, onion, jalapeno and avocado) that would compete with dining options at Roosevelt Avenue (but for cleaner seating options, hygiene, and clean bathrooms), and entrees like Camarones a la Diabla, Cecina Asada which compete with finer dining options but without compromising on the flavor and heat level. And, everyone does show up. Diners include groups of ladies (ladies night), couples, families, professionals out for lunch, nearby students, older diners, and span ethnicities as one would hope to see in a city like New York! I've been here at least half a dozen times, and service has been courteous and professional, without being obtrusive. So, this is no Daniel, but waiters would pop up when they would see my glass empty, or to clear my plates. Servers speak English, and so you don't have the issue of authenticity but a language barrier should you not speak Spanish (as in Sunset Park). Still, a word of caution: make sure that your server has understood your order for I've had a couple of instances where I got Salsa Verde, not Roja, and the server got confused whether I wanted the Mariscos soup, or the Mariscos entrée featuring Camarones.Of the items sampled I've loved, loved all the ceviche: Cozumel (wild stripe bass, habaneros citrus, mango, avocado, red onions), Vuelve a la Vida (cocktail shrimp, octopus, crab meat, oysters, cilantro, tomato, onion, and jalapeno chile) and Acapulco. I've also liked the Chilaquiles (Tortilla, green Tomatillo salsa, with onion, sour cream, and cotija cheese), the Quesadillas (with corn truffle), Huaraches... pretty much everything including the aforementioned Cecina Asada and Camarones a la Diabla.Despite the ability to do well across a wide array of menu items at a range of price points, I'm disappointed that none of their desserts measure up. I've tried the bread pudding with banana ice cream, Pastel Mixteco (Chocolate lava cake with sesame ice cream), the Coffee Crème Brulee, and the Tres leches. Only the latter would be worth the indulgence, and sadly bring down your evaluation of what would consistently be a 5 star meal in terms of authenticity, variety, value, execution, and service.

1037,3,5,4.0,"After living in NYC for over a year and a half, I still had never gotten a haircut here. I go back to California quite a bit, so I always schedule my hair appointments with my trusted stylist and colorist back home. However, I haven't been back home in six months and as a result, my hair has lately looked like I could try out for the Asian version of Tangled 2. On one particularly hot and muggy day in June, I literally could not take the weight of my Rapunzel hair anymore and decided that I had to get a haircut. I had passed by Cutting Edge Salon on numerous occasions and several friends had recommended it to me before so I decided to check the place out on Yelp. There were some really confusing reviews and people seemed to throw out random prices in each one, so I decided to call and put my Mandarin skills to use.To cut to the chase, here's the deal:Make an appointment, but even if you do, you might have to wait for a bit. However, the prices are cheap here so it's well worth the extra 10 minutes. If you go Monday through Thursday, you get cheaper pricing. If you decide to get a randomly assigned stylist, you pay $26 (includes tax, not tip). If you opt to choose a stylist, the haircut will range from $33-$40 depending on who you go with. I think that Kenneth has a premium and might actually be $42 but I'd double check on that. If you didn't realize it yet, this is a fantastic deal. Where else are you going to find a wash, cut and blow out for $26 in the city?! At a place that doesn't look like rats are frolicking around in the shampoo in the backroom anyway.So I decided to leave it up to fate and was assigned Neal. He was very meticulous with my haircut and spent a full 45 minutes cutting and styling my hair. He did a good job working with me to figure out what I wanted and made really helpful suggestions when I didn't have an immediate answer for his questions. The place was closing, but when he heard I was going out to dinner after the appointment, he stayed late to spend more time curling and styling my hair to perfection.One day, I will get an appointment with Kenneth to see what all the hype is about, but for now, I'm really happy with my haircut!",16,0.981

It's Murray's. It's world class. Tia, the head fromager, is brilliant. I kind of want to just hang out with her and drink wine, eat cheese, and play poker all night.The list of cheeses from which to select is outstanding.** I'd recommend going with four or five of them,*** plus a salad or two, lemony olives, and some grilled artichokes to make this into a perfect meal. If, like me, you are a cheese purist, skip the cooked dishes from the kitchen (at least before the cold weather arrives). The butternut kugel and grilled halloumi, for example, are tasty, but not spectacular. Instead, enjoy your cheeses unadulterated, with the fromager's chosen pairings, such as whole candied walnuts, pickled carrots, and dollops of seedy mustard. Potential weak spot: the pairings aren't quite as exciting as those at Casellula, Tia's former baby, which I still adore, as well. But that's a very small point, with plenty of room for improvement.MCB carries some fantastic and not-typical wines to enjoy with your cheeses. Some are priced high for what they are, but you can choose wisely. My humble suggestions: Malvasia-Trebbiano if you want white, Nebbiolo for red.

Well... they claim to have the best vegetarian burger in town.I was here on a weeknight at about 7 PM, and it was so empty that I wondered if I walked into this place before they opened. Also, they had the beheaded and hollowed out body of a chicken just sitting there on the bar. Nice decoration, indeed.Once my dining companion arrived, we moved over to the inner restaurant area - this whole space is quite tiny. Our orders were taken promptly and with a smile, and our waters were kept full through the evening.I got the haus veggie burger, which is this mishmash of walnuts and blackeyed peas (a genius idea i think) with some edam and greens. There was a mention of a pickled something and I was kinda looking forward to the acid, but the pickles were only salty and it left me craving for some tartness in the dish. The beet ketchup, while innovative and quiet delicious, was again less acidic than its conventional tomato counterpart. Nevertheless, the burger made for a solid tasty meal and there is no trace of grease on the fried bread. I really wouldn't have guessed until Steven the owner walked over and reminded us that we're not exactly eating a healthy meal. I loved the buttermilk aioli and the green apple slices on the side were a wonderful complement. My good friend James F. also seemed to really enjoy his burger (just guessing given the state of his plate after he was done). We also shared the halusky fries, but it was not quite soft on the inside as described, just little curly crisp potato bits.Finally, as a final push into a heart attack, we shared a fried nutella filled langos bread, served with jalapeno jam. A pretty unconventional but interesting combination.I loved that Steven likes to do interesting things with the menu, I loved that he stopped by our table several times to chat, seemed like a genuinely nice guy. He makes brunch every weekend for his guests and the menu changes based on what he feels like (and perhaps what you feel like too, if he has ingredients).

Seriously I thought it was just a tiki bar, but it's so much more, because of the live music in the back of the bar.I got to the place before my friends did, and heard the music coming from the back. Of course I immediately walked towards the music, and saw a ragtag group of very talented musicians playing a variety of a rowdy version of popular songs from the 60s and 70s. I was later to find out that this was a group of musicians led by the incomparable Frank Wood. They had a very captive audience of people who are obvious fans and friends.The drinks are also nice, and you can also pay a little extra to keep their tiki mugs. But if I go back to Otto's, I'd be going back for the music.Check out their list of events:ottosshrunkenhead.com/pa…",12,0.9645

To share our views on what rocks, what doesn't, and whatever else we feel like Yelping about.2) E-Commerce -- From Groupon to Etsy, who doesn't love a great deal? 3) Tavern On JaneWhen the three collide, it's like an electronic orgasm. With no AA batteries needed.My favorite new E-Commerce platform is Scoutmob. Download the app, see where the deals are, and take advantage. No need to buy up front. It's like they're giving away free money! And thanks to Scoutmob, I learned of Tavern on Jane. When I needed a place to meet friends on the West Side, I ""scouted"" it out and learned I could get $20 off, so to the Tavern we went.The place is cute, for lack of a better word. It's really more of a restaurant than a tavern, though they do have a large bar and a decent beer selection. For quieter dining, hit up the back room. My burger was juicy without being too messy, and the fried oysters we shared for an appetizer were quite tasty. And my friends liked what they had (roast chicken and grilled chicken sandwich), too.That covers E-Commerce and T on J, leaving only Social Media.

I placed my order through Seamless at 7:25pm this evening and it arrived at 7:32. SEVEN THIRTY TWO. That's SEVEN MINUTES later. 7. minutes. I can't even comprehend this. I live a good 10 blocks away, so there's a decent amount of distance between the restaurant and my apartment. I ordered a Pad Thai with some special requests, and the adjustments were made too so they actually had to take a minute to alter their recipe...which takes time. But they delivered to me in 7 minutes. Which is no time. I don't get it. Have the folks at Enthaice discovered a primitive form of time travel? Do they have a helicopter? Do they have a small, side kitchen in the lobby of my apartment building? HOW?!?! Me and my roommate have an ongoing competition to see who gets their Enthaice order faster. He held the previous record at 11 minutes, but I'm the new King as of tonight, and It'll be a long reign. 7 minutes can't be topped. Though that's what we said about 11 minutes, so who knows...The food? Oh right. Listen, I like their Pad Thai. It's a good portion size, the chicken isn't half-bad, they make it spicy upon my request, the noodles themselves are just a pinch more flavorful than my ex-lover Tiny Thai across the way, and it's always satisfying. The Basil Chicken is delicious, though a bit small-portioned, and their curries excel similarly in flavor but lose points for size. None of the dishes are life-changing or 'the best rendition of a Thai classic you've ever had' but they hit the spot, and they hit it hard. And dude, come on. 7 minutes. SEVEN MINUTES?!?! I'm almost scared to eat food delivered to me that fast.I realize this won't apply to even 1/100th of the people that ever order from this place, but I order from here twice a week and I've never waited more than 20 minutes in my life, so how can I knock 'em?

1045,32,16,4.0,"Good things come in small packages. That's what it's been always said. Somehow, I thought about it while reading Sorella's Qualcosina menu. Literally, ""a little something"", which I think it is not only an extremely cute word but an excellent example that the proverb is generally true. The small dishes menu offered a Sorella are an excellent exhibition of what seems to be simple at first, but that hide ""a little something"" to made it special. Foodies out there ... this is a loud call for you.Getting into Sorella a few days ago, I desired two things. Handicap access and a wine menu featuring other than Italian. The last one exclusively related to the fact that I don't know enough Italian wines and therefore I feel lost if I have to order. However, only one of those prevailed when we left. And I believe even my 3 friends secretly shared it with me. Because let me tell you, crutches or not, no one wanna deal with a high step after 3 bottles of wine. I find Sorella an extremely delightful place in all senses you can think about. Even their logo is something you must take a look. Sorella, which means sister, and so an specular image of two girls holding a glass of wine that connect them together. The patio in the back is lovely but when I was leaving I also desired that we have stayed in the main room, the ambiance there is captivating an intimacy come by almost instantly. Please, bring the one that is continuously in your mind and in your heart. It was also my desire to have been there with him. Even when the style is modern and sophisticated, it feels warm and cozy. Mainly because of the human factor. You know, the way they greet you, the way they serve you, the way your glass is refill with an smile every single time. No matter who. And also because the overall ambiance it's calm and peaceful. I would recommend to order a few dishes to share. We just felt attracted to their qualcosinas, but their entire menu is appealing and intriguing. We went with some of their classics: Pate di fegato (liver), of course. And here is where Dan T. pointed it out right: Flavor. The bite is exceptionally tasty, even when it is chicken liver mousse that I have find in many other places to be bland and tasting like plain liver unseasoned. Here, the duck takes control. And it's fascinating that apparently it came from the bread, a muffin bread made with duck fat. The liver mousse is more than generous portion, unctuous, rich and filling and it wouldn't even need the egg, neither the bacon but those additions elevate the dish even more. We also order Fava beans and Brussels with bacon and apples both of them excellent and extremely tasty although I wasn't satisfied with the Brussels texture because they were dry. All the opposite however for my favorite dish of the night: Beef Carne Cruda, which is beef tartare topped with crispy shallots, accompanied by Podda cheese and celery, apple and herb salad together with lemon alioli. The small chunks of meat were juicy and flavorful, pure high quality meat. The wine menu offers a large selection of Italian wines. Either by the glass as well as by the bottle. With a price range extremely reasonable. You can also choose among their beers including some Italians. Tap (birra) and also by the bottle. Yes, you can order beer bottles. Our idea of lets just have a bottle and something to eat, ended up several hours later with a total of 3 bottles for 4 people. Each one better than the other. As usual for Italian wines, the menu is presented by the region where the wine is coming from and the year. Our friend took care of the wine because he knew better, and I can't recall which ones we had other that an excellent Barolo to start. All of them were light and delicate to the palate. It feels great when in Sorella and time just flew by without noticing. Quoting Jonas M.'s brilliant question ""When you look into your napkin at the end of a meal, what do you see?"" I would say ""I see myself asking that same question over and over to Sorella's napkins from now on""",28,0.9993

Jin has been garnering a lot of attention from ramen lovers, and with good reason.Let's take into account that this is all the way in Harlem. It's not worth trekking from lower Manhatten, but if you're craving a bowl of ramen, and you're uptown on the west side, Jin is worth stopping in for a bite. The storefront is hidden directly next to a subway exit - so much so that if you're on the east side of Broadway, you'd never know that it was there. Like any great ramen shop, Jin Ramen has a bar that you can sit at while watching the chefs plate together your meal. You know what that means, right? It's one of those places you don't mind eating at alone. (Smiles!)The Kani Salad is a combination of imitation crab, cucumber and kelp mixed with a spicy mayo dressing. It's a delicate combination of richness that will make your taste buds squeal with delight. The Miso Ramen is different from most of the other ramen that you will encounter. The broth is a blend of chicken and pork stock - common enough. However, in addition to the typical ramen toppings that you might find somewhere else, the Miso Ramen is served with a spicy bean paste, butter and corn, leeks, scallions, bean sprouts, chicken sausage, bok choy, sesame seeds, nori roasted seaweed, and pork belly. Instead of the typical ramen noodles, you'll find that the noodles served in this ramen are thick, curly, slightly chewier, and yellow.",15,0.9563

But instead of the $1, $1.50 up-charge that I am expecting, it's THREE WHOLE DOLLARS more! I mean, what is going on here? I felt totally bamboozled. The prices for everything BUT the special are totally hidden behind the cashier in tiny print amidst the GIANT celeb testimonials, not down by the grill where you order. By time they paralyzed me with total sticker shock, I had no idea what I was really paying for, but I am pretty sure that the cost differential between the normal juice and the pineapple is way less than $3. And what in god's name could even justify such a huge price difference anyway?! I mean, a $3 juice and $2.50 per hot dog would be par for the course at any normal place, but the whole point of Gray's is that you're not paying the usual NYC prices, so I felt sad sad sad. I mean, I still love Gray's and all, but I got a little bit burned on that one.(EDIT: Yes, it's like, $1.60 for a normal drink and $2.90 for a pineapple, so I was majorly ripped off.

I actually tripped and nearly killed myself in oncoming traffic when I locked eyes with the sign and began absentmindedly crossing the street - a shop that ONLY SELLS CAKE POPS?!?!?! Incredible.The two ladies behind the counter were in the midst of trying out a new recipe that would include Pop Rocks (I know, why didn't I think of that?) but were really nice and helpful.

The red velvet was very tasty and soft, but I found the frosting overwhelmed the cookie a bit. However, I'm a bit more sensitive to sweet than most so this may just be me.

Being stingy with the 5's lately, but call it a 4.5.The Atmosphere: The atmosphere is more polished than you regularly find in the East Village vs. the college feel that so many spots have. You could bring a date or pickier friends here and be fine. It's slightly loud, but you can hear those closest to you fairly well.The Pricing: Reasonable for NYC. With drinks and a feast of a dinner, appetizers and a range of great dishes, $45/person. I can see a frugal group still doing wonderfully. The sizes of dishes are quite good for the hungry New Yorker. The Service: There are plenty of them. The night we were there, there were a few coordination issues between them. Despite all, service was pretty fantastic. I love that the chef came out and asked everyone how the food was. It was pretty amazing that she also gave out little mango lassi type drinks to various guests that were still in the area. They do a fabulous job of making the dining experience personal.The Food: This is not your typical Thai, thank goodness! I wish I'd written down the names of stuff, as the don't have a menu on-line. But I forgot... whoops... so yelpers bear with me as I describe their current season menu:1) Papaya Pad Thai... Get it with the Soft shell crab. The Chef does an excellent job of cleaning and frying this soft shell crab so you get it's lovely flavor. We divided our table in 1/2 as there were 10 of us. The other side got beef or something.... doesn't even matter, because they shortly stole our dish in envy.... really...we never saw it again... But that's ok because....(see below)2) Beet ravioli....I love beets and thought to order this unassuming dish for a vegetarian that was lovely enough to grace our side of the table. This was by far one of my favorite. In other words... get this one! A-Plus...It helped me get over the loss of Item 1.3) Oysters.... I love to get oysters at Asian places, as they get so creative with the sauce you add. Ngam is no exception. Solid.4) The squash in curry. If you're vegetarian, this is nice option. The sauce was slightly watery, but the flavor was spot on given no meat to help embolden the taste.5) Fish.... There is one in particular that everyone gets. And you should too. Your waiter will tell you. I was told it might be the branzino...anyway, Here is the deal. I contend it's plated wrong. If I wasn't writing to my fastidious Yelp audience, I wouldn't even mention it. This large whole fish is deliciously tempura'd with a sauce that is quite flavorful. The baby peppercorns, provide both visual and taste appeal. But I know some of you elites are going to have the same crazy dialogue in your head as I did that will say to you... ""wow... if only I could get to the sauce easier to bath my little fish and lightly sauce this handsome, breaded guy. How sad that his underbelly is over-sauced while this top part is untouched by the yummy liquid!""... or something like this.

I got their Hakata hot pot tasing menu both times. We got 3 orders for 4 people but that is plenty of food already. We didn't bother ordering anything else extra. 1) Sashimi appetizers: The thinly sliced sashimi is drenched in this sesame vinegar sauce and it is absolutely delicious. I can very possibly eat the whole plate myself. 2) Pig Salad: Or whatever they called in on the menu was very very good. There were a ton of those shredded pork on top of greens in a homemade sauce with caviar. IT was absolutely delicious and again, I would love to consume the whole plate myself.3)Japanese fried Chicken: The chicken are crispy and not greasy at all. They use chicken thigh I think so it is pretty juicy and tender. Love it! 4) The hot pot took a while to cook. We picked the hakata one and in Japanese it says it improves your skin health because it contains a lot of collagen, aka, pig skin. But do not fear. It is very delicious. It has a ton of Chinese chives, cabbage, some pork belly, dumplings and yummy broth. The set menu also comes with either bibimbop or ramen noodles. I have tried both and they are both good depending on what you prefer. We ended our meal with their strawberry ice cream and Japanese black sugar mochi. They are to die for. You can taste the strawberry and the sweet black sugar in the mochi! Well, there are some downsides to the restaurant. The service, when you do get it, is great. Yet, unfortunately, it is a little scattered. You don't and won't get much attention as you would like to. The restaurant is also on the small side so if you didn't make a reservation, you would probably wait for an hour and more. One last thing to add is that the waiters/waitress are too nice to discourage outrageous customer behaviors. Last time I was there, there was a big table of LOUD customers.

I got over my suspicions fast, and it's a good thing I did, because the quality food and attentive service live up to the promise of the vibe.The front room is dominated by a big bar, which was sparsely populated by the after-work crowd when we arrived. Things loosened up as the night went on, though. This space is well set up for groups, but the back area looked date-worthy.We decided to order a variety of appetizers to go with our Singha's and Asahi's. Purple blossom (chicken/peanut) dumplings, po pia tod rolls (filled with glass noodles), croquettes made of shrimp/taro, and roasted duck buns--everything was inventive, tasty, and beautifully presented. It was all so filling that the four of us powered down on the entrees (although notice that we wouldn't consider doing without). The huge Pad See Ew (we substituted chicken for the beef) was a tad greasy but worth it for the flavor. We also shared the pan-seared halibut, which while expensive at $26 was nicely cooked and served with an almost-sweet, tamarind-inflected sauce. The service is still a bit hesitant, but almost insanely solicitous. There were almost--dare I say it?--too many servers. Somehow, I managed to get used to being treated like a princess. On the way out, I asked what the name means, since I (cynical to the end) was sure that ""nuaa"" was invented nonsense. ""It's a Thai word meaning tasty,"" I was cheerfully instructed.

You order in a cramped area inside the door, but you can see the food that you are ordering right up front, which is a nice touch. The dining area is a similarly smallish room down a hall past the front door.

The food is pretty good. I usually get the Kansas City sweet and sticky ribs with a couple of sides. The ribs are tender and flavorful, with lots of sauce. For sides, I usually get the mac and cheese and baked beans. It is a fantastic combo, IMO. Another nice touch is that you can get wine. We often get a bottle of Malbec to wash down the ribs.

Two, I reevaluate my life.The Patriot is one of the few great true dive bars left in the city. It's two levels, plays country music, and has a $5 whiskey shot and PBR special. The bartenders drink with you, and as a result usually end up dancing on the bars themselves while handing out free shots.

It's beautiful, hidden, and exclusive - perpendicular to Gramercy Park, and straddled by the mess of the East Village and Union Square, but completely quiet and collegiate. Tiny restaurants dot the sidewalk, Casa Mono being the most prominent.Casa Mono serves fantastic, traditional, Spanish tapas. Tapas have been so Americanized that they're translated to mean anything served on a saucer these days - far from the actual Spanish dishes they were derived from. Additionally, it's not a genre of food comprised of the most elegant of ingredients - octopus, potato, fried balls of rice and ham...but Casa Mono makes Tapas as traditional and elegant as you can get in NYC.The Pan Con Tomate is simple perfection. Grilled baguette, sliced down the middle, rubbed down with garlic cloves, olive oil and a roasted tomato, with tomato seeds and pulp garnishing the crispy bread. Patatas Bravas are a little different than I remember - they're more baked than fried, but still very tasty. The skirt steak with romesco can't be missed - while the romesco is less garlicky and more pesto-y than what I'd had in spain, it's still got that red kick to it, and the steak is actually quite a generous portion for a tapas-style plate, sliced and artfully stacked. Mussels with Chorizo and champagne are salty and indulgent, but don't fill you up too much. A good wine list, and a free glass of cava with a 4sq check-in! I totally approve of the food.Why not 5 stars? It's pitch-black in there, and you're practically on top of your fellow diners - but not in authentic, old school way - just an overstuffed with small tables way.

If you're going to make the (admittedly delicious) cocktails prohibitively expensive, it would be nice if they also offered a couple of drinkable beers as an alternative.That being said, the Jamaican Sazerac was very good.",13,0.9601
1063,14,11,4.0,"MISSION: ACCOMPLISHEDChef Danny Bowien is quickly rising amongst the transplant Chef world, making his presence known with tons of media coverage. We picked up an issue of Bon Appetit to check out the latest ongoings in the food world. Low and behold, there's Danny again headlining w/ Andrew Knowlton reflecting on their recent trip to eating up Chengdu. With much fanfare surrounding the opening, we wanted to satiate our need to know why the SF mainstay is much heralded.Not for the faint of heart, Mission Chinese packs some serious heat. Not marketed as such, you may want to bring some milk with you. On Grand Opening Day, we even saw Daniel Boulud and his posse walk in eager to try the food.In the former Rhong-Tiam LES space, Mission Chinese made some improvements. The kitchen and 'reception' area remains the same, but the Thai murals are gone. There is now a bar out back with some interesting Asian cocktails. The ceiling is now covered with wood. There are even chairs hanging from the ceiling beams and a giant red paper dragon draping across the room. The 'pay phone' door is now gone and replaced with a curtain. Also, tiles were placed out back instead of wood and the pass to go to the back has clear glass allowing curious eyes to peep into the kitchen.THE FOOD#1. Sichuan Pickled Vegetables [Napa cabbage, carrot, nasturtium, sichuan pepper, beer] ($4) - primarily cabbage, not crazy about the bitterness from the beer [NOT SPICY]#10. Lamb Cheek Dumplings [Black vinegar, rock sugar, peanuts, numbing peppercorn] ($8) - They sold out of this quickly, there's no wonder why. The black vinegar is in your face but pairs well. Must get. [NOT SPICY]#12. Stir Fried Pork Jowl and Radishes [Fermented black bean, red perilla, mint] ($11) - Another favorite, this reminded us of double fried pork belly. The perilla puts this dish over the top and makes it SING! [NOT SPICY]#13. Salt Cod Fried Rice [Slow cooked mackerel, chinese sausage, lettuce, egg] ($11) - instead of using the typical salted cod, they used mackerel, which actually works well. The chinese sausage could be crispy and there could be more 'wok hey' or wok flavor/appearance since the rice looks and tastes steamed but still solid [NOT SPICY]#15. Thrice Cooked Bacon [Shanghainese rice cakes, tofu skin, bitter melon, chili oil] ($11.50) - someone was either really smart or really high to think of this dish, but it's genius. For those closed minded, the bitter melon grows on you, great combination of flavors, quite oily, please lose the liquid smoke [SPICY]#16. Mapo Tofu [Pork shoulder, doubanjiang, sichuan pepper] ($12.50) - we didn't care for this dish, as it was more like a soup than anything, with over the top 'ma la', or numbing from the sichuan peppers, almost guaranteed to be a doggy bag, very oily [VERY SPICY]#18. Chongqing Chicken Wings [Fragrant chili and crispy beef tripe] ($10) - good but not great, deceptively NOT spicy, despite the slew of red peppers surrounding it. Don't forget to pick at the fried beef tripe, as they taste like fat globules from the heavens [NOT SPICY]WHAT WE LOVE1. The Service - Down to earth and friendly, the owners make their rounds constantly not afraid to get their hands dirty, assuring you have everything to you need to walk out happy. Grand Opening Day, there was even a keg to help yourself while you waited for your table. The owner even gave us a free family bowl of rice while we awaited our fried rice.2. The Philanthropy - 75 cents from each of the entrees is given to the Food Bank of NYC. More restaurants should learn from this & follow suit. 3. The 'Up Yours' menu - We love that they stuck to their guns and made the menu THEIR way (super spicy), not catering to the American palate. However, we found it excessive for our taste buds, and we LOVE spicy food. 4. The Food - Take heed to the 2 flames on the menu=your tongue will be burning and you will be reaching for your milk. You will notice that every dish is 1 ingredient away from being 'truly' Chinese. Whether it be nasturtium leaf, perilla leaf, radish, or pastrami, the flavors jive and that's what matters most. Purposely so, the food is comforting and cooked with love. You feel like your friend's Chinese mom cooked for you. Makes for great hangover food as well.THINGS TO IMPROVE ON1. The Menu - There is no pricing on the lighted wall menu. You can ask for a laminated menu to peruse, but why not just list the price on the wall menu too? Also, since the menus are already laminated, may be cool to provide dry erase markers for patrons to circle the number of the dishes they want to order to help expedite things.2. The Pace - Your food may come all at once or one dish at a time. This allows for some of the food to get cold as you eat the other dishes. For this reason, pacing would be nice.No resys so be prepared to wait 2hrs+ Total came out to $30/pp after everythingPics up so",29,0.9988

There is acting, then film, then screenwriting, then plays. There is cooking, then baking, then grilling. The one thing I disliked is the fact that all of the shelves are extremely high so if the section you're looking for is all the way towards the top, you need to use a ladder.

All of which were cold because of me being late, but the left overs were magnificent. On top of the dishes my friends ordered, I ordered the arugula salad.I love truffled anything so this dish peaked my interest. Peppery arugula, with a lemon dressing with truffled potatoes. Often times, truffled anything can be a little too much but the mix of the peppery arugula and lemon dressing was a match made in heaven. Winebar definitely did a great job with this dish. The cheesy potatoes were just as great, I didn't get to read the description for them but wine bar did a swell job. The cheese plate was also memorable, stinky, very stinky. Stinky and delicious.

1067,24,23,4.0,"Junoon is a case of creative cooking gone a little amuck. Vikas Khanna claims to represent five techniques of Indian cooking--pot, fire pit, stone, griddle and clay oven--and delivers variety that comes at the expense of uniformly high quality. But before I label this a case of misdirected passion (junoon=passion), I must say that Junoon has one of the best ambiances of any Indian restaurant in New York, and the classic North Indian dishes taste next only to their versions at Tamarind in Tribeca. I have been to Junoon on about ten occasions and have found that it is both expensive and frustrating to stray away from the mainstream dishes on the menu. I would wholeheartedly recommend the paneer pakoras and the chaat from the selection of appetizers. The entrees offer a fair selection--pick one of the channa pindi, daal makhani or daal tadka (listed as accompaniments) or the bhindi. The desserts are unusual for an Indian restaurant. Lemon crepe? Apple tarte? Chocolate parfait? Stick to the kulfi trio, but try and have them make all three kulfis in the trio the same--the pistachio kind.Junoon is in the triumvirate of Indian restaurants in New York that have been awarded a Michelin star, besides Tamarind and Tulsi, and I can see why.

I was glad my co-worker chose this place because I've always wanted to try it. We scored a nice table upstairs, which was somewhat quieter, cozy and romantic. Although it may appear as one of those trendy scene restaurants with beautiful people and overpriced mediocre food, this place actually serves pretty amazing tasty food that equals the fancy ambiance! I was more impressed with the appetizers and desserts than the main course, which is why I deducted 1 star. The appetizers knocked our socks off from the get go, raising our expectations even higher for the entrees. Although the entrees were still good, they lacked the wow factor but fortunately the fantastic desserts made up for the just average main course.Here are what we tried:1) Beef Carpaccio: 5+ stars!!!! Wow wow wooooooow!!!! Party in my mouth!!! This is the best beef carpaccio I've ever had!!! Loved the crunchy crisps that were used as a garnish! Beef was so soft and tender that it melts in your mouth!2) Roasted Mushrooms: 5 stars. Beautifully prepared roasted mushrooms taste amazing when you mix them with fried egg, ricotta , and pancetta. Delizioso!3) Spicy Sweetpeas: 3.5 stars. It's OK, but not a must-order.4) Cauliflower with bread crumbs :3.5 stars. The same comment as spicy sweetpeas.5) Burrata with marmalade and crispy crackers: 5 stars! This was such a divine way to start out meal..... heavenly!!!6) Hanger Steak : 3 stars. I'm sorry but this was a disappointing dish for me... it didn't have a rich flavor, and without the accompanying tartar sauce, I could care less about the meat. The potatoes too were a tad too salty for me.7) Roasted Chicken: 4 stars. Soooo much better than hanger steak. this humble roasted chicken was surprisingly tasty and full of flavor. It was well marinated.8) Pasta: 4 stars - I forgot which one it was, but it was one of the pappardelle pasta, which was simple and yet authentic. 9) Olive Oil Cake: 5 stars!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! The bestest olive oil cake I've ever had!!! Better than Ai Fiori!! Winning combo of salty and sweet!10) Dulce de Leche Panna Cotta: 3 stars. It's not bad, but I'd rather order 1 more olive oil cake instead.11) Hazelnut Chocolate Torta: 4.5 stars. I'm a sucker for sea salt + dark chocolate combo, so this was an automatic winner!Ambiance: AService: AFood: A-Price: $$$$Reservation is a must even on week nights!!!

That alone is a reason to come, right?! No but really, celebs got it right in coming to Katz's. The chefs are amazing. One particular chef in charge of the sandwich section not only made a mean pastrami sandwich, but let my friend and myself sample the chicken salad and slices of pastrami before choosing. He asked us where we were from, if we had been there, and then told us about the famousness of Katz's. Wonderful human being. Everyone else in the deli, including the cop at the front, was friendly. The pastrami sandwich was delectable. For $15.95 you get a giant sandwich, stacked with meat and toppings (Swiss cheese, mustard and sauerkraut if you wish), along with a huge plate of both dill and half-sour pickles.

1070,27,23,4.0,"This was the best cookie I've had in years......  A few readers might raise their eyebrows at that, but those who've read my reviews regularly should be surprised to read that it wasn't a macaron. It was the chocolate sable cookie at Mille-feuille.The sable cookie has existed for hundreds of years, but the god of baking, Pierre Herme introduced the Sables Korova (for a restaurant off the Champs Elysee) that ranks as my favorite chocolate cookie. It's legendary for being addictive: indulgent, chocolate studded, and sprinkled with Fleur de Sel to tease the taste buds alternatively between sugar and salt. My own consumption preference is to eat them warm, where the temperature difference between the melty chocolate, and the crumbly sand like cookie, accentuates the explosive taste of chocolate - and makes one swoon.This is no exaggeration. I've now developed a habit of sharing anything new with the colleagues (market feedback), and while the girls chattered excitedly after eating The Next Big Thing (macarons), when I turned around after putting the box of cookies back in the cabinet, I saw that the two of them were slumped over the desk in rapture. Office decorum required that they not display the ecstasy publicly ;)But, that was once, and even though I've visited Mille-feuille 3 times since, and bought a box of the chocolate sable cookies each time - that melty texture has been absent (and hold back on the salt, dude!). I suspect that these boxes have low turnover as people instead ooh and aah over their macarons. Now, I like their macarons, and God knows I love macarons more than any cookie, but it's frustrating not to experience a repeat of that ecstasy. Speaking of the $ 1.90 macarons, I find that they're bigger than the versions I like best (LMDC, Cours La Reine, Little Oven), and a bit on the sweeter side. My favorite flavors have been Chocolate Praline and the ghastly green Pistachio. Other versions have been competent, but their Rose just doesn't excite the taste buds or the nose. Also, contrary to repeated advice from the server to consume them immediately (the filling is ganache and not buttercream), my preference is to wait 30 minutes.Consistency is my major gripe with Mille-Feuille. I have loved the Financier one day to come back and eat an over-baked, almost burnt one, the next time. The hazelnut brownie has been good once but dry the other. The Pain au Chocolat has disappointed many times due to poor texture: lacking the necessary bite and shatter effect. The Madeleines have been disappointing.However, there's little that brightens up my morning than walking into a bakery and being hit by the whiff of butter and of freshly baked buttery pastries. Their plain croissant is definitely my favorite version in NYC. Layers of buttery dough, nice shatter effect, and served warm in the morning - which is a rarity in this wonderful city. Eating the croissant while sipping the La Colombe coffee on a bench in Washington Square Park - bring together three of my favorite activities and lifts the mood to tackle any drudgery the workday may have in store. Not to mention, it's the rare occasion when one is able to bring someone to ecstasy in a professional environment. Now excuse me, as I prepare for Take 5!

1077,28,14,4.0,"Everything happens for a reason. That's what I keep hearing since my accident over 2 months ago. What do you think? I came to realize that it is certainly true. For many reasons. Similarly, this Kori story is somehow connected to this rational since we unexpectedly ended up having dinner at Kori after finding out that Zutto Japanese American pub does not have handicap access. By the way, talking about connections, Kori's people says that Kori means connection in Korean to explain the concept under which the restaurant is built. They want to expose all us New Yorkers, to Korean cuisine. My Korean friends are not completely agree, but instead said that Kori means chain .. Chains connect two things together so lets just leave it like that . And let me tell you, that concept is quite well executed here. If you are having first contact with Korean cuisine, Kori made the job quite right. But be warn, the flavor is there, yet something is missing. Which it can be good if you are not use to it. I visualize Kori in between the two worlds. East meet West and vice versa. Korean enough, but made to satisfy unexposed palates. Said this, and getting use to it, I have to say I really liked the food. It was well done and tasty. In fact, there wasn't not even a little thing that I could complain about. Not bad for a backup plan, right? Since we didn't have a table and it was on Saturday night, the waiting time wasn't short when we showed up. I was surprise by this being located in a quiet area in TriBeCa. At any case, they were extremely courteous and keep checking on us many times and apologizing for the time. Later, they serve us scallion pancake on the house to compensate how long we had to wait. Judge it yourself. The space is really cool. Modern, calm and peaceful. Candle lights fill up the ambiance, definitely on the dark side along with the furniture and general color notes. That gave you the intimacy for an special dinner. While waiting for a table we were seating on the bar drinking a bottle of Kaori sake, as per the bartender recommendation. Since he said the sparkling nigori that we selected first was on the very sweet side. Kaori however was crispy and fruity. Not too sweet, not too bitter. Perfect. The selection of sakes in not that large but he knew what they serve and I like bartenders like that. Soju is also on the menu, of course, and many cocktails as well as wines and beer. In case you are wondering, we saw a couple eating on the bar instead of waiting for a table. We were three+2 crutches, that formula wouldn't have work, but who knows next time. Contrary to the fine ambiance, the menu features mainly simple dishes that I would call street food. We order Topoki (Dubokki), rice cakes on chili sauce. While the texture was perfect, the chili sauce wasn't quite right as I have get many times in other places. It was spicy, not too much, but I mostly missed the sweetness and garlic. Still, it is an enjoyable dish and definitely a must order to contact Korean cuisine for rookies. We got next the seafood jun, (scallion pancake with squid and shrimp). The pancake was crispier on the edges and I liked that, but still tender and fluffy and full of seafood, which was the predominant note. Don't expect banchan on the beginning of your meal but instead along with the main dishes, 2 kind of pickles and Kimchee. Excellent kimchee. I particularly enjoyed the ramyeon, o Korean ramen, instant noodles on a spicy broth with kimchee and rice cakes slices that we choose with tofu and vegetable dumplings. Comforting, and with the characteristic spiciness from the kimchee. But what I enjoyed the most was of course, their bimbimbop. We choose Seafood dolsot with brown rice. This reminds me that all in their menu seems to feature organic products and that they gave you the option to choose in between brown or white rice. Unusual yet appreciative for many I bet. Even they asked if someone of us was vegetarian to accommodate our food to it. I really liked the bimbimbop. Served on a hot stone bowl (dolsot), the crispy rice on the bottom is still on my mind and the flavor was intense, rich on seafood but I was impress the most by the texture of the squid. So tender and perfect. Order this. As others says, is their stellar dish. You want the connexion with the West? think of less creamy than risotto, more juicy than Spanish seafood rice. Well, everything happens for a reason. Because of what happen at Zutto, we went to Kori, first time I went out after many weeks of taking good and mandatory care of myself.

Balsamic Mushroom & Fennel - delicious, had an unexpectedly smoky bacony taste, which I found enthralling3. Curried Califlower & Sweet Onion - probably my favorite of the flight because it was so different from any other mac I've tried. I'm not usually a califlower fan, but this was really good with a nice crunch to it. Everything tastes better with cheese and sweet onions!4. Beecher's 3 Cheese Plate - we made a fortunate (primarily wine-induced) choice to order this cheese plate and it was delicious! Also very fun to try the flagship by itself after eating the melted mac and cheese version. Still delicious!PARTING THOUGHT: If you missed the UD Perk deal, fret not. Every day from 5p-7p, Beecher's has a pretty sweet happy hour. $5 glasses of house pinot grigio & cab, $6 cocktail of the day, $7 food (including ""world's best"" mac and cheese and a 2 Cheese Plate, which includes the flagship!).

Keep in mind that you will need to either A) know someone, B) be a hot girl, or C) be willing to drop A LOT of cash. The space is pretty tight, everything about it seems like it's been around for years. It has a really cool vaudeville/circus vibe inside. There's an aerial hoop artist swinging above the bar between shows. She was super flexible, the guys below definitely enjoyed the show. As you go towards the stage in the main room it gets crowded. I would suggest getting a table when coming here, and getting one upstairs. Of course that will probably mean spending a minimum of $1k though. I watched from below and it was packed and very hard to see the stage. The night I went.... there was a schoolgirl lap dance act, a yodeling little person puppet duo, a contortionist/silk artist, and a man shaving his balls and flashing the audience with his breasts. Sooo yea. If you want a wild way to cap off an evening, come to The Box.One final note on the negative reviews.... Yes the doormen are assholes, that is a given at any hot spot in Manhattan. Saying management should ""fire them"" is laughable. They would just be happy to hear they're doing the job they hired them to do! The space inside is also very limited so they can't just let anyone in who is not buying a table. And finally, the drink prices are high, but when you factor in that you aren't paying a cover and seeing nudity/acrobatic acts, you are actually getting a pretty good deal for 20 bucks!",17,0.9367
1082,12,8,4.0,"Honestly, I was expecting that the sturgeon king would not be able to justify his high prices, but Barney Greengrass delivered an absolutely awesome brunch. There's just something special about going to an old school Jewish deli on the Upper West Side. I felt like I was in a Woody Allen movie (OK I just checked and the place actually WAS in a Woody Allen movie. Figures.) It also reminded me of Russ and Daughters, but with the added bonus of seating and table service. If you want a sit down Jewish breakfast, Barney Greengrass is the place to go. Boyfriend and I stopped in around noon one weekend and were seated at a tiny tiny table without any wait. He got a sturgeon sandwich, I got cheese blintzs, and we both got some sassy-but-well-meant attitude from our waiter. The sturgeon was awesome. I haven't eaten a lot of sturgeon in my day, but I've recently had a couple of opportunities to try it and it really is delicious. If, like me, you think that sturgeon is an unfortunate sounding word and does not sound like something you would like to eat, do not let that discourage you. The salty smoked flavor is very unique and tasty, and every time I've had it, I've craved more. There is something addictive good about sturgeon!The cheese blintzes were also delicious. But how can you go wrong with blintzes, really? I mean, it's sweet and cheesy and fried all at once, tempered by rich and tangy sour cream. If you like a hearty breakfast, take a break from bacon and eggs and try a blinz. And if you are at Barney Greengrass and don't want to spend nearly twenty dollars on sturgeon, the blintz is an excellent consolation prize. As I said, I was skeptical that the sturgeon would be worth the price tag, but I think it is actually a worthy splurge. If you love sturgeon, you should definitely make the investment here. The atmosphere is a wonderful slice of old New York, and the fish lives up to its regal reputation. If you want to try sturgeon for the first time, you're not going to get it better than you would here. Of course, it's a bit of a risk spending so much money on something you've never had before, but I'd say the odds are in your favor.",12,0.9985
1083,6,4,4.0,"Ah, this is where it all began. My love affair with food, I mean. Had my very first fine dining experience when I was 12 with my family.. and since i'm a big girl now, you know that a resto that's been around that long has it going on. 1 star docked because it wasn't as good as I recall. But times change, and menus change. And I say to try GT's seasonal tasting menu. I took bf here for his birthday Sunday night (Giant game night, so there were an unusually low ratio of peeps dining..thankfully for us, a coveted 8:30 resto opened from our prior 6:30.. which was booked more than a month in advance, FYI)Let's start with the decor. It's beautiful! Like you just stepped out of the city and got a whiff of the country air...with fresh flowers, produce, lots of rustic wood. The walls are adorned with paintings of historical American stuff. But, ""tavern"" should be more like ""cottage"" since it's not ""tavern-pub"" like at all. There is a lot of space in the dining room- it's a big resto.Starters: bread- bet plain and sourdough. Plain was crusty and standard and sourdough was nicely sour (they give you alot). Amuse- a goat cheese puff (dry)The winter tasting menu is $116 pp. (The regular 3 course are $88 and full sized). The courses (all beautifully presented) were as follows (AND were the right portions, despite your eyes initially deceiving you.. trust me, we were SO full)1. Fluke Tartare with radish and american caviar- This is one of my fav dishes of the night. With lots of cirtrus flavor, the tartare was extremely fresh, and chilled, that it popped in your mouth. Nothing fishy about this-- my bf , who doesn't like fish much, enjoyed it. You get small heapings of radish and caviar (esp the latter) but its' salty enough to know it's there.2. Clam Chowder- Not your original bisque. It's not thick so dieters, be happy. You'll taste more celery (delish) in the base. The fried oysters are amazing (perfectly done and still crispy, despite being in soup!) and the razor clams are fresh and not fishy. The shrimp was cooked to perfection-- soft, but not overdone. Lastly, the TROUT roe pops in your mouth, and adds a salty kick- making for a fun culinary experience (note that the food is a bit salty, but the waiters are very good about re filling your water)3. Halibut- steamed--a unique way of having this fish. The carrot/cabbage soup base seeps into the fish for some serious carrot-esque flavor. The cabbage is crunchy, a good play on texture. The calamari is small tiny and steamed also (well not fried). While we recognized the artistry in this dish, it was our least fav.4.Duck dumplings- Not my fav way to have kale (it's a bit soggy), but excellent dumplings. The wrapper is so thin and light and managed to carefully balance the heavy, dense meat inside. There was a LOT of very flavorful duck in here5. Despite the site menu saying next was venison, it was in fact, it's sirloin. I did not have this bc I don't eat red meat. Instead, the waiter asked if I'd like the sea bass from the regular menu. I had asked if I could have the pork loin and belly (which I originally opted for because of the belly- so my bf could try. I don't eat pork, normally). I told him pork, but somehow he forgot and brought me sea bass. Now, I LOVED the sea bass. So I didn't mind, and in hindsight, I really don't like pork. But... that was an example of poor service, so I was a bit surprised. Our waiter was sweet, and even offered to bring me something else if I didn't like the sea bass, but I'm not sure how knowledgable he was. (seemed to have to think hard about each dish, and was kind of the person that was like ""everything's good""...yes I know.. but I want some detailed recs, man). In any case, the sea bass (which was FULL portion, as it was from the reg menu) was awesome. Perfectly fresh and cooked. But even better was the SAUCE. A candied walnut-apple-mango sauce which was so perfectly buttery, and sweet... I honestly will say that I cannot even describe it in words. You need to go and try it for yourself. The fish was plated on top of spaghetti squash, which I love. It was perfectly baked and strung.. not too soggy. I finished this but couldn't finish the whole fish. Bf had the sirloin, which he said wasn't the best. It was in a wine reduction and came with a sweet potato. 6. Tasting dessert- we had a sampling of the graham cracker goat cheesecake with a concord grape sorbet- AWESOME. and true to ALL subtle flavors. Then, pistachio ice cream with salted caramel/ peanut butter crumble (very good- me), and passion fruit with American meringue (bf- very sour and good. They put a candle in his dessert with Happy Bday writing per my request up front)Misc: petit fours, peppermint chocolate, small choc pies, hazelnut macaroons (dry), and gingerbread/pumpkin truffles-eh, but what you do expect for free. We got a take home apple oatmeal muffin which was kinda like coffee cake- this was VERY good (we had it the next day)",10,0.9992

A restaurant with 533 reviews. How naive.We did have a little bit of a wait to be seated, but ours was a small party of 2 and it wasn't too bad. My husband and I had already munched on an early dinner (partly due to the lack of vegetarian options here) and so ended up doing what we usually do at great restaurants with limited vegetarian options. Drinks + Dessert. My favourite parts of any meal anyway!We shared a couple of different kinds of sake between the two of us, and I found that our server's recommendation was on point. They do have an extensive list of sake so colour me suitably impressed at him knowing that like the back of his hand.The food at Sakagura, in all its limited vegetarian friendliness, is actually quite tasty. Undeterred by minor facts like we'd already eaten dinner, we went ahead and ordered a few appetizers to share anyway. Let's call it.. for the sake of research, hmm? The eggplant with three different kinds of miso(red, spinach and egg yolk) was delicate, understated and grilled perfectly. We also shared the seaweed salad with the citrus vinaigrette.The black sesame creme brulee was certainly interesting, and I might order it another day when I'm in the mood for something different, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the texture itself. Owing to the addition of sesame, the custard had taken a grainy form, though I loved the texture of the delicate caramel, which shattered upon the slightest little tap of my spoon. We also got the chocolate souffle, which was predictably tasty.We also got to live through the first date of the couple that was seated by us.

1086,10,10,4.0,"There's a reason Sarabeth's so frequently finds itself on those ""Best Brunch"" lists you see in New York Magazine, Time Out New York, and any other print or online publication that takes the time to generate such lists. Simply speaking, Sarabeth's KNOWS BRUNCH. When my mom, brother, aunt and I went one Saturday morning, we got a sense of just how popular this place was in the neighborhood: the line was out the door, with people braving the cold in the hopes of snagging a table (even if they had to wait 30-40 minutes to do so). Once seated, we decided to try a few things and sample each others meals (strategy, guys, strategy). On the menu: Eggs Benedict, lemon ricotta pancakes, almond-crusted french toast and the farmer's omelette. There's nothing quite like lemon ricotta pancakes made the right way. The ricotta makes the batter extra light, so it seems like you're biting into a cloud of lemony sweetness - delicious. The almond crust on the french toast was not at all overpowering, providing a nice crunch to the sweet toast. Leeks, bacon, potato and Gruyere seem like a perfect mix for a nice winter soup, and that combo works equally well in an omelette: the creaminess of the Gruyere enhanced the saltiness of the bacon, while the leeks and potatoes managed to balance each other out. As for the eggs Benedict (which I ordered): sometimes this dish can be tricky if you don't get a good piece of Canadian bacon, if the egg isn't poached just right, or if the hollandaise is too heavy. No tricks here. Everything was great.On a side note, my hilarious aunt was so in love with the Bloody Mary, she asked for a to-go cup to sip on the rest of it while we were walking around the city.",13,0.9741
1087,11,8,4.0,"You will not find a place in New York City that makes you feel closer to the Emerald Isle than Mary's, located in a distinctly Irish neighborhood in the far northern reaches of the Bronx. Woodlawn Heights is a place you will hear thick Irish accents and see almost all signage written in green. In the center of this is Mary Moylan, a chef originally from County Kilkenny. If you are not charmed by her friendliness and hospitality (not to mention her cooking), you simply have no soul!Inside the small primarily takeout/delivery store you will find a couple handwritten chalkboards and seven stools lining a small counter for eating in. The phone rings pretty frequently with orders, and most people stop in to pick up their food and say hello to Mary, delivering gossip and updates on life along the way. She seems to know all of her customers well, and takes care of everything with a precision that revolves around love.The sausage mash & beans ($8.50) is a good combination of flavors for a meal, found under the ""traditional fare"" section of the menu. We recommend staying on this side anyways, but the place does cater to the usual bar crowd with burgers and nachos and the like. The sausages are fried and retain their juiciness, and combined with the potatoes and a little Chef Sauce, make for a delectable bite.The shepherd's pie ($8.50), like most places in New York City is actually a cottage pie, made with ground beef and not lamb, but is distinct from your average Irish pub by a long shot. The ingredients are fresh and it is not over-salted like most. It is hard to get a sense of the enormity of this pie from the photo below, but it is far larger than the size of your face, and a smaller portion is available for $5.I could not help but order a Scotch egg ($2.50) from the refrigerated case. It appears as a nice fried globe, and when described as a boiled egg wrapped in sausage then fried, becomes something any meal should not be without. My companion for this meal giggled and proclaimed that this was the ""first time a taste made me laugh.""Katonah Avenue and Woodlawn Heights in the Bronx spill a little over the northern border into Yonkers, and the whole neighborhood is an absolute gem.

My 12th Grade Geology teacher never taught me that. I'm disappointed in him, but pleased that the museum didn't keep me in the dark about it.I learned about the taxidermist, Carl Akeley, that collected the gorillas for some of the diorama exhibits. Though originally there to collect specimens, after experiencing killing them, he became an advocate for their preservation. Fascinating story! I learned the difference between butterflies and moths.

First of all, their servers have mastered the art of flattery. Our delightful waiter complimented me on my outfit before we were even seated, and was extremely attentive to us and intuitive to our vacuum-cleaner-esque feeding needs throughout the entire duration of our stay. We ended up getting not one, but TWO guacamole appetizers in quick succession, thanks to the freshness of the first guac we got. It really is incredibly fresh, and I can't think of another Mexican place in the City where you can get such good guacamole for $7. It's topped with freshly cut cilantro and onion. The chips are thick and crispy, and the servers have no problem bringing you more as soon as you've run out (the salsa is great, too, but hot, hot, hot!)As for the main course, my friend ended up getting two steak tacos (which live up to their fabulous reputation and I highly recommend putting some guac on top), and I ended up getting one steak and one cactus, both of which were phenomenally tasty. The tortilla is soft, warm, and chewy like it ought to be. And if you're wondering what the heck cactus tastes like, imagine the taste of a caremalized onion, but green. We also got the sangria (one glass of white, and one glass of red), but I think that was the only part of my meal that I was not super excited about. It's a good run-of-the-mill sangria I suppose, but if you're at all a snob about wine like I am, or if you insist on your sangria having real fruit in it like I do, you will probably be disappointed and should go with a margarita instead.",9,0.985

I am so sick of Mo Money Mo Problems. It is no longer a throwback to 6th grade. I hear it every time I go out (and yes, it was played that night, as well).I overlooked the DJ's questionable facial hair in order to recognize that his ability to play and mix music is probably the best I've heard in NY. Pretty sure his status was sealed when he flawlessly transitioned from Nicki Minaj's 'Superbass' to The Outfield's 'Your Love'. (I didn't think it was possible, either.)I actually picked this bar for my friend's birthday party, despite never having been here before. Well, technically, I gave her six choices and she chose this one. We arrived just before 11 pm to no line. Coat check was $2; bathrooms got progressively dirtier throughout the evening. We didn't reserve a table, so there were no stripper poles in our experience, just the dance floor and bar.The dance floor never got too crowded (thanks to the hour-long line outside that prevented other friends from getting in), nor did the bar. The one bartender I did go to all night was very friendly, but my usual Absolute and Diet Coke tasted like it was mixed with just a little bit of terrible -- all for $10. At first I thought maybe he just used regular Coke, but I'm pretty sure I saw him hit the Diet Coke button the next two times and the terrible taste never subsided. The drinks were also not strong at all. My suggestion is to pregame like you're in college if you really want to get drunk here.

They've basically taken the ""Giant After Work Bar"" concept and done it up for people who like to drink really well and don't care about Happy Hour specials. The first thing you need to know about the Tippler is that it's HUGE, and has a massive after work crowd as it instantly became the best bar (by far) in the meatpacking district the day that it opened. The difference between this and most giant bars (and what makes this place so special) is the amazing quality of the drinks and food offered in what is basically a quick service/after work bar/party times environment. Sure, you can order a Gin & Tonic (but why not get the Gin & Chronic?). You can also have a great craft cocktail, or beer, or something off their splendid wine and champagne lists, or an aprtif or digestif, or a frozen drink that doesn't suck.... you get the picture.

I'm not into Indian food, so that rules out 95% of the vegetarian restaurants in NYC. If this place had more vegetarian options that were not fried, I would have definitely given it 5 stars.

Try the sweet maple butter with the bread. The hush puppies (fried dough with jalapenos) were good but a bit on the spicy side for me. The hot factor definitely creeps up on you.

For the main course, I can't remember what I had, but I do remember it was mediocre in taste and the presentation was very artistic and interesting.

Those that ordered and hoarded the pumpkin and turnip soup and crab cakes had handlebar smiles afterwards.I really wanted a steak. I inquired about the steak from our waiter. He passively did not endorse it. He did recommend the Catfish. Upon imposing the question about the steak, the eye contact confirmed it. If the most expensive entree cannot be endorsed by the waitstaff, who works for tips and check averages, in terms of gratuity, do not ""Go"" and do not collect $200.My Coconut Rice and Peas entree, however, was lukewarm. The Blackened Catfish and Yard Bird i tasted were dry. Maybe because, this was a packed house product. Maybe it was the qualitative best of the cooks this evening.

I had never been above 86th street, and here I was in my Yankee t-shirt on the way to my first baseball game. The 86th street stop had come and gone a long time ago. The subway car was packed so tightly now that I knew we were close. We emerged from the darkness to an elevated platform and then I was blinded by something. I didn't know what it was, but I let my eyes readjust, and there out of the blindness, I began to see again. I realized that the bright lights of the stadium is what blinded me and I had never seen anything so beautiful.As a child, everything impresses you. But this was something completely different. This was something that tangibly touched my soul and rattled it. The subway cars opened, and people in their navy blue shirts and Yankees hats began chanting ""Let's Go Yankees!"" in unison. It would be something that I'd come to say over and over in my life. As soon as I got into the stadium, I was in awe and knew from then on my life would never be the same. At that moment, I became a Yankees fan for life.In life, things come and go. The stadium is gone now, and has been replaced by a new stadium. Those memories will never leave you, but there's just no longer a physical representation of them anymore. Like the players that retire, our love has to move on. It gets reshaped and you learn to love again. Nothing will ever come close to the old stadium, but the Yankees organization has done a good job in bringing the love and nostalgia that people have for that stadium to the new one. Every child in New York in their life should be taken to Yankee Stadium. Some of the best memories of my life have taken place here and I know that I will create new ones at the new stadium for the rest of my adult life.I go to over 40 games a year and consider myself an expert on the place, so I'm going to spend the rest of my time giving you tips on how to enjoy the game.FOOD:Go to Carls Steaks and get the Philly Cheesesteak. There are two locations. Section 104 and Section 222. Great cheesesteaks!Garlic fries at the garlic fries stand near section 106. DRINKS:Do not settle for the standard Miller Lites that are throughout the stadium. Every single level has ""Beers of the World"" They're only $2 more than the Buds and Millers. Hoegarden, Stella, Corona, Becks, and Guiness are served on draft at these stands.TICKET PRICES:If you can hold out, you can usually get tickets at cheaper than face value on Stubhub.com a few hours before the game. They stop selling tickets two hours before the game time. Stubhub is officially the reseller of MLB and they guarantee you entrance. It is not risky at all. MONUMENT PARK:The park closes 45 minutes before every game. Go two hours before the game if you really want to see it. There's always a line, but it goes fast. Don't be intimidated. It is a must see. I make it a point to go every single opening day. Call me superstitious.DON'T BE LATE! WEAR A JERSEY! WEAR A HAT! WEAR A BASEBALL SHIRT! DON'T BE ONE OF THOSE STUFFY CORPORATE TYPES!AND MOST IMPORTANTLY:Enjoy yourself. Take in the game. STAY UNTIL THE END! And just pray you get to be there when Mariano Rivera runs to the mound while ""Enter Sandman"" is playing. For those that don't know, Rivera only pitches in the 9th inning. You must stay for him! Watch him pitch in the twilight of his career. You are watching a master at work. Watching Mariano Rivera pitch makes you wonder if its similar to how people felt when they say Mozart compose. Take your kids. Take your special someone. And just relax and watch the greatest game in the world.I would like to thank for the good lord for making me a Yankees fan.",19,0.9985

But now I can cross that off my list and I plan on crossing it off plenty more because I now LOVE Ethiopian food!There were six of us, and we ordered five entrees which was plenty to go around. We actually had trouble finishing it all. I have to agree with the majority of the reviewers that said the vegetarian entrees are the best. We ordered two orders of the veg combo and the rest were meat but I'd say the veg combos were the best.[EDIT: We went back again last week and this time, both the meat and veg dishes were amazing. The meat wasn't as salty as the last time which implies a bit of inconsistency in their food but I think I'm willing to risk that just for their veg combo] We also got the avocado salad. It was really good! Perfectly vinegary and it was gone in less than a minute. We also ordered the honey wine which complemented the food very well. However, it was too sweet for my taste. It reminded me of the plum wine they offer at Japanese restaurants. The place isn't too big but they can accommodate parties of about 10 people as long as you let them know ahead of time. Also, the service was great despite the fact that our party kept changing the number of seats we would need. I've worked as a server before so I know how annoying this can get, especially when you have a packed house. However, everyone was really nice and I plan to be back!",8,0.9932

Like most people, I was initially quite perturbed by the idea of eating Octopus balls...wait, what? ""Balls""? But no, it's just grilled octopus rolled into a ball-shaped dumpling. But, whoa, Octopus? Trust me, it tastes just like calamari. Whatever magic they do in that tiny kitchen, their takoyaki are the best. I also love their Okonomiyaki and you get to choose either beef, shrimp, pork, or squid in your pancake. Add a bit of mayo, sauce, and bonito flakes, you get this amazing meal for under $10. The only set back is that the place is really really tiny (no seating; just take-out) and it's a bit of wait since they make everything on the spot. Therefore, guaranteed freshness.",7,0.965

1102,21,19,4.0,"The quiet stretch of 36th Street that houses Toledo is a far cry from its namesake city on the banks of the Tagus, but the restaurant certainly deserves all the praise and accolades for being a worthy setting for fine dining when one is trapped in this relatively quieter but still characterless part of midtown.Start with a plate of manchego, and then try the black bean soup with confidence. Let the plush setting and the attentive wait staff make you feel more important than you are and you look. But before visions of grandeur begin to take over, finish that plate of paella--every kind is well executed. When the dessert cart comes along, ask for the tartufo--it is an amazing complement to the food.If only Toledo could graduate from a street to an avenue, it would likely have more traffic.

1105,7,4,4.0,"This is a review for a class -- specifically, the champagne tasting class. The backstory: I wanted to do something a little different for my birthday this year, and I do love wine tasting, so after a little Google searching I found a convenient tasting that just happened to be on my birthday, albeit at a wine store I'd never been to nor heard of. I corralled 6 of my closest friends together for a 6:30pm 2 hr lecture and tasting. Having never set foot into the store, I wasn't sure want to expect, but upon arrival I was pleased to see a small but attractive wine store with a cozy, nicely lit back room with chairs and tables set with, pens, literature on the wines, glasses, water, and crackers. The class was at capacity (~21 total), and they aim to start on time. We tried 8 different wines in total, 7 of which were sparkling, 1 of which was the hard-to-find pinot meunier, which we learned is one of the 3 varietals blended to make true champagne from Champagne. While the class got off to a slow start (we didn't have our first sip until almost half an hour in), I ended up learning quite a bit from the lady lecturer and tasting some really nice wines. Among many tidbits, we learned the difference between blanc de blanc and blanc de noir, barrel and steel (""charmant"") fermentation, spumante and frizzante, dry and brut. If I'd make any changes, it would be to give people a taste to sip on from the start of class so there's less palpable chomping-at-the-bit tension in the room. If you want to buy a wine you've tasted, they offer a 10% discount. Overall, it was informative, fun, and worth the seemingly steep $65 price tag. I would happily do another wine tasting class here for a special occasion.",9,0.9927
1106,9,11,4.0,"Two of my favorite things in life: multiple assortments of meat (that's what she said) and ninjas. Gyu-Kaku has both, I shall explain. Gyu-Kaku, pronounced OO-KA-KOO (as per our waitress Yisel), is a meat-lover's dream. I entered with a friend, and were greeted with the rich aroma of maillard reaction as I could smell the denatured proteins on the surface of the meat recombine with the sugars present. I was highly impressed by the clan of servers we had. I honestly do believe that there is a secret ninja school, at the back of the restaurant...I shall explain. I drink like a fish, that is, I drink WATER like a fish; and may I say that my glass was always full. They've trained their servers to have secret intense ninja senses; my friend is extremely sensitive to ice, allergic almost; the ninja waiter noticed this, and ensured her glass was always at room temperature....our glasses were always full, green tea was always kept at the right heat, our food portions were the exact 3.5oz that they suggested, our grill was replaced consistently (without a slight raise of the hand)...but most of all, as our waiter(s) spoke to us/took our order, they all managed to squat down effortlessly to ensure that they gave perfect eye contact as they took our order(s). Once our meal arrived, like little savages---we couldn't wait to devour it---in our defense we were starved for hours. We packed our grill with our vegetables to steam (potato garlic was great, muschroom medley is a must, and the asparagus was divine). But the meat, the meat was so damn good (for lack of a better phrase). We ordered the garlic shrimp (ok). The short ribs were marbled to perfection, and marinated in a sweet sauce. As we grilled it, the charring of the meat allowed for the perfect flavor. We then took a dab at the miso steak (which I believe is their most popular item, as described in the menu as #1 most popular item)---this was again, so damn good. I mean, no words, no words. It wasn't dry, just the right thickness of meat (lol), and it just tasted so freaking good. As we settled down from our food coma, and came back to reality, I was disappointed that we had to leave, so soon. We placed our cards to pay, and in a ""ninja second"", Ben (our other waiter, we had 10), like a little covert mercenary---comes out with our cards, with two pens. I couldn't breath. Two pens, I love that I didn't have to share my pen. I digress, I will come again, and this time order more garlic rice.",14,0.9937

Clarke's; Marea had just closed. It was such a pleasant evening we kept strolling east on Central Park South, and we swung into South Gate for a snack and a drink.It is perfectly posh and predictably spendy, as hotel bars are. At $12 a glass, Carménère is the cheapest red wine on the list; if you hanker for champers, Louis Roederer is $19 a glass. For my first round I had Junipero gin and Tomm's homemade tonic (the only cocktail on the list that seemed vaguely worth the $16, i.e. that I couldn't just make at home). The tonic was very nice, if a bit sweet. We ordered the grilled chicken salad (chicken was freshly grilled all right, and the mixed greens were pretty awesome, which they'd better be for $19. Cheese and avocado balanced it all out nicely, but there wasn't enough pancetta for it to have been mentioned on the menu description), the tuna tacos (more avocado, which is always good in my world, julienned radish and a crispy taco shell, $18) and the crab croquettes (a pretty portion of tot-sized fritters, served in a stemless cocktail glass on a bed of tasty fried onions, with a side of delicious grainy mustard for dipping). The savory food is divided into ""bites"" and ""fork and knife.""Our server was charming and hospitable, with a sense of humor. However, he neglected to tell us that it was last call for dessert. He claimed no one ever ordered it. I suppose he had no way of knowing about my dessert THING. But he caught on quickly: sensing I might lose it, he scurried off and procured a cheesecake from room service (coconut ice cream, whipped cream, berries). I would have preferred a chocolate pot de creme, but it was a nice gesture. He did charge us for an order of sorbet; I forgave him for charging us for something we didn't really order, since we did finish the cheesecake, after all.They have super fancy Cognac and Scotch options, if that's your thing. Good luck trying to find something reasonably priced to sip with your dessert. I opted for Ardbeg 10 year single malt Scotch, $16.It was a lovely room to while away an hour or two, with sexy lighting and big picture windows to admire the Park after dark, gorgeous flower arrangements (orchids and huge magnolia branches on this particular night) one of those fancy fake fireplaces, and a luxurious powder room three times the size of many an East Village dwelling.

Their decor is the tits: taxidermy specimens, exposed brick, and vintage photos give their bar a character that is both rustic yet refined. When I took two Parisian women[2] there, they were impressed with its mysterious, down-to-earth feel. That's saying something.To enter, first pass through a hot dog shop, via their not-so-secret entrance; a line usually gives it away. Yes, this speakeasy is wildly popular, but a limit of four per table keeps matters under control, offering a reprieve from the unwashed masses. Inside, share space with a mix of the dressy and casual (this is New York), at the mercy of almost manic bartenders that thankfully love their jobs. It's not the quickest time getting in - the host(ess) takes numbers from those waiting, and follows up with them - so be prepared to kill time elsewhere.Their concoctions are a bit rough around the edges, but if you like hot dogs, you're in luck: the dining menu is one page of them[3].

1109,11,8,4.0,"The first time my friend and I went to Mon Petit Cafe, it was on a whim. We happened to have been in the neighbourhood and we needed lunch. The second time we went back, we also happened to have been in the neighbourhood, but I requested that we went back to the restaurant as I've been wanting to eat more French food lately.Mon Petit Cafe is one of those restaurants with tiny tables and cozy decor that, had you walked in during the afternoon like we did, when the sun was out and customers were having lively brunch time conversations, it would not stretch the imagination very far to picture it with a dimly-lit dinner atmosphere at night as well. We had arrived, on both occassions, only a little past 12 o'clock on Sundays, and the restaurant was perhaps a bit more than half full. When it was time for us to leave, it was busy enough that people had to wait for a table.The restaurant's brunch menu has some classic light French dishes like quiche, crepe, ratatouille, and brioche French toast, as well as brunch favourites such as Eggs Benedict and Eggs Florentine. And of course, there was also a section devoted to their omelette selection. I settled on the brioche French toast with ham, and my friend ordered the ratatouille, which was what I had the first time I was at Mon Petit Cafe. I also ordered a mimosa to help keep me hydrated - I would have prefered a bloody mary, but they do not offer it.Our food arrived and the first thing I thought was how great my French toast dish looked. I normally don't care much about presentation unless I am at an expensive restaurant, but I really liked how it was put together. The French toast itself sat prominently in the middle, surrounded by a cut of ham, and a few pieces of cut strawberries and bananas. The bottom of the dish itself was sprinkled with powdered sugar and under the French toast was a bit of syrup. A glass bottle of rich and sugary syrup was also brought out for me to use to lather up the french toast, should I choose - and I did, although I didn't think it actually needed the lathering. This brioche French toast really hit the spot, with its fulfilling and sweet body that did not leave me feeling like I've stuffed myself. That stuffed feeling would come later after I ate my dessert. I did not try my friend's ratatouille, but as I remembered it from my first visit, it was very delicious. It was cooked with two eggs sunny side up sitting on top of the vegetables themselves. The tomatos were flavourful without being overpowering, and made for a liquidy consistency in the dish. While I was writing this review, I wondered what French toast was called in French. You would think that in three years of high school French, one of the first things I would have learnt in class was what French toast was called in French. But no, I never learnt it. Well here it is - it's called pain perdu, literally translated as ""lost bread"". It's bread that is ""lost"" because French toast was made as a way to use bread that had gone stale. Basically, hardened bread was softened and made edible when soaked and cooked.So after the French toast, I really wasn't hungry anymore. But my friend hesitated not more than two seconds after finishing her dish to suggest dessert, and I, in doing my part to lessen the overpopulation of desserts in NYC, responded that it was an excellent suggestion. So it was Flan au Caramel for her, and Creme Brulee for me. I did not try my friend's flan, but my creme brulee was excellent and about half of it ended up in my friend's stomach.I see that Mon Petit Cafe has coq au vin in its dinner menu. It's been years since I've had coq au vin, which I'm certain is a crime in my own personal Inception universe in which Ellen Page would scold me for it. Hopefully I'll find an excuse to be in the UES at night sometime and have dinner at this restaurant.",11,0.9934
1110,9,2,4.0,"This is an unexpected treat in the South Bronx. It's warm, cozy and welcoming, and the food is great. I came in here on a cold and rainy day and thoroughly enjoyed a half price beer during their excellent happy hour special. I also got a delicious salad with pear and blue cheese, which is one of my all time favorite salad combos. It also had some delicious grape tomatoes and red onion in it. Very tasty. However, the main event was undeniably their burger, which came with a mountain of crispy sweet potato fries and was served on a giant toasted english muffin. Growing up, I hated squishy supermarket hamburger rolls, and my mom came up with the english muffin as a substitute, so I was very happy to see the Bruckner employing one on their burger, which came nice and medium rare, with a nice slice of ripe tomato, some red onion and, for a dollar more, melted cheddar cheese. It was an excellent burger that I would order again in a heart beat. All in all, I was just so impressed with the food, the atmosphere, and the friendly service at the Bruckner Bar and Grill. The waiters were so friendly and encouraged me to come back again, which I fully intend to do. If you live nearby (I'm fairly close myself), you owe it to yourself to stop by!",11,0.9956
1111,17,11,4.0,"Move over Room Service! There's a new flamboyant Thai restaurant in town, and it's bigger AND better! Qi's decor is fabulously over the top. Adorned in textured white and clear acrylic, Qi is like a futuristic Buddhist temple complete with a Buddha statue in the back. To break up the sterile white, there are massive, lenticular panels of Thai dancers yelp.com/biz_photos/JzD9… that run throughout the whole restaurant, including a particularly creepy one in the bathroom that appears to be staring at you as you wash your hands. If you think chandeliers are just for ceilings, think again. Qi uses glass-encased chandeliers for tables as well as for table-top decor. yelp.com/biz_photos/JzD9… Too bad the front of the restaurant is completely glass. Even though I discovered Qi because their interior caught my eye when I happened to be walking by, when you're inside, being able to see all of the traffic and grunge of 8th Ave makes the experience feel a lot less glam. It would have been really cool if the glass were double-sided, a window from the outside but a mirror from the inside.The food at Qi won't win any awards, but it's just as good if not better than a lot of the other Thai restaurants in the area. Qi has two menus: the Bangkok Selection menu and the Bangkok Classic menu. Designed by Pichet Ong, the Bangkok Selection is supposed to be the more ""authentic"" out of the two. How else can they explain the higher price point? The Bangkok Classic consists of the typical soups, salads, curries, noodles, and rice dishes you'd find at any Thai restaurant in Hell's Kitchen. I've tried items off both menus and I enjoyed both. While the GREEN DUCK CURRY yelp.com/biz_photos/JzD9… I had off the Bangkok Selection menu was very flavorful and tasty, the RED CURRY yelp.com/biz_photos/JzD9… I had off of the Bangkok Classic menu was equally good, proof that more expensive does not equal better. Give the Bangkok Selection menu a try if you're looking for something unique to Qi, but keep in mind that items on this menu cannot be adjusted. The Bangkok Classic menu is easier to tailor to your own tastes since you can specify spice level and choose the type of meat you want in your noodles or curry. Do not skip dessert! Pichet Ong, known primarily as a dessert chef, also designed Qi's dessert menu. I had the CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT DOME (with green tea ice cream) yelp.com/biz_photos/JzD9… the first time I went to Qi and it was so rich and creamy. Even if you're too full for dessert, at least get the ice cream trio (Bailey's, chocolate-chili, green tea). yelp.com/biz_photos/JzD9… My favorite was the chocolate-chili; they definitely don't hold back on the spice. Qi can also boast of a creative drink menu. They have a huge selection of flavored mojitos (I recommend passion fruit, watermelon, or lychee because those are made from real fruit) yelp.com/biz_photos/JzD9… and potent herb-infused drinks. There's even a drink with a paragraph-long name! yelp.com/biz_photos/JzD9… Apparently that's the official/old name for Bangkok.I've already been to Qi two times in the past couple of weeks and I can definitely see myself coming back for more. It's a great place to grab drinks after work or pre/post theater as a well a solid choice for Thai food lovers, or if you simply want to overdose on glitz and glamor.----LUNCH: Hey Midtown lunchers, Qi delivers!

All in all, Black Duck is an intimidate affair with dim lighting, old American decor (with weird mermaid chandeliers) and a swanky bar. My bf and I came on a quiet Sunday around 8pm. Not many people were here - it was maybe 75% full. We made a rez for 8:30 but they sat us early. The hostess/coat check girl was super sweet. Our waiter was sweet too- he wasn't pushy considering we had a restaurant.com deal for $25 off $40 min. and 18% tip...and that we didn't order alcohol. Our waiter made good recommendations and food came out really fast. His top 2 dishes were the duck, and the halibut (per Yelp also) but sadly they only had the duck confit that night (not the breast, as the menu says) so he was honest in saying skip it. Apparently the breast is the highlight. Instead, I got the halibut. It was really good- nicely roasted to give off a crusty, yummy flavor. It wasn't overcooked at all. Atop really yummy sweet corn risotto, which was...really sweet! In a good way. Risotto done nicely. And sauteed spinach which was really nice and not overly done (just right). $28.My bf ordered the burger, done medium rare. He said it was more rare, and juicy. It came on a wheat bun (cheese is optional). Instead of fries, he got extra salad, which they had no qualms with. Didn't try as I don't eat beef but I take his word that it was yummy. $15. I would have liked to try the tuna tartare appetizer but we just weren't too hungry. I wasn't blown away by the dessert selection (and not hungry enough) but they had brownies with vanilla ice cream, berries and sorbet, creme brulee, and chocolate molten lava cake (but not that night). All were $8 ish. My bf ordered peppermint tea- which is kind of pricey here. $4 but you get 3 cups worth and they have lots of flavors.This is kind of normal new American hotel fare for me but done well so I had no complaints. They were also showing Golden Eye so that was a plus...a little entertainment on the side. Apparently they had live jazz sometimes but I have no idea where the band would play. I probably wouldn't come back just because there are so many other places I'd like to try, but I recommend this place.

There is an insular feeling created by the atmosphere, so even if you are sitting right next to another table of people, you still feel like the only people there. I've never seen any raucous drunken behavior here; everyone keeps it down, talking in the sort of hushed voices you use at the library or at church...it adds to the mystique, I think.

I can't comment on the prepared food, because I've never gotten any. I always would hit up the olive bins, the fruit, and the upstairs. Upstairs is my FAVORITE.

1118,6,6,4.0,"Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown seldom impress or even satisfy me. Having had many misses with Vietnamese places in NYC, I was admittedly a bit reluctant to try Pho Grand for the first time. Jesus Christ, what in the world was I waiting for?! I wish someone had told me how good this place is a long, long time ago... so I could have avoided all those mistrials at other inferior joints.First off, Pho Grand is quite clean compared to other Chinatown restaurants. The ambiance is acceptable, the menu filled with proper English and the prices very affordable. No wonder more than half of the diners there on the Friday evening I visited were Caucasian. I guess they had all turned to Yelp and I just missed the memo?As far as the food goes, the boyfriend and I ordered our usual. He had the #1 xe lua pho, I ordered the bun (vermicelli) with grilled pork, and we shared the cha gio spring roll appetizer. The spring roll wrappers were crispy and not too oily, and the filling tasted pretty fresh. I was also very happy with my bun dish, as the vermicelli was nicely steamed and the miscellaneous veggies providing some nice crunch. I was even more blown away by the grilled pork that accompanied my vermicelli, which were beautifully charred, thinly sliced pieces of sweet and savory pork. In fact, it was almost jerky-like, reminding me of the awesome fresh pork jerky I had in Shanghai this winter. While I didn't try any of the bf's pho, he was very pleased with it. I am so glad to have discovered this place, I'm sure to become a regular here in no time!",8,0.992

Just the way I like it.The go to place for Congee (pi dan shou rou), light and clean, the Chinese version of grandma's chicken noodle soup. Sure fire cure for a hang over. Dip some fried crueller in this, and you'll swear you're back in China.1/4 duck. Crispy skin. Good fat to meat ratio.Beef Chow fun- very authentic, since this is a Cantonese establishment.I also enjoy the Shrimp wonton noodle soup. But, I think the quality of this has gone down of late.All this will run you like $20, and feed 4 people. Throw a couple bucks down for tip and you're walking out with both your stomach and your wallet full.**EDIT** Get the Lobster Yi Mien! (Special on the wall). I believe it is $18 for 1 lobster cooked in ginger-scallion-garlic and served on a bed of ""yi mien"". Yi Mien is a kind of delightfully chewy golden colored egg noodle where the dough is made with soda water so it is super light and has a unique texture. These noodles soak up all the sauce that the lobster is cooked in, so all that lovely sauce + lobster flavor doesn't get wasted! Definitely a great deal, since you get LOBSTER for $18!***EDIT AGAIN***Get the Soy Sauce chicken from the BBQ deck. It comes with this garlicky green sauce to dip in. The chicken is extremely flavorful and tender. This is my new favorite protein... Soy sauce chicken is better than Roast duck in my book these days!",10,0.9889

All he wanted that day was a big plate of red meat (and some other things, but yelp isn't the place to talk about that...).The reservation was made with ease and we didn't wait at all for our table. Keens is oooooold school - according the man, it's the oldest steakhouse in the city - and you can literally see the history on every surface. Pictures and newspaper clippings and, of course, those clay pipes hanging from the ceiling. Dark woods and deep wine colored fabrics complete the ""den"" atmosphere. The next table over was a loud and ruddy cheeked group of eight middle aged men. Our server was a pro, not especially kind, but clearly seasoned and good at what he does. We got going with some cocktails, grilled thick cut smoked bacon, and Maryland crab cakes. I would have been content gnawing on five plates of the bacon, it was so flavorful and heavenly. These were my first crab cakes and, while they weren't bad per se, I was hoping to be more impressed. Next came wine and entrees: the 8oz filet mignon, the king's cut prime rib, and the scallop special. My filet was cooked to perfection and accompanied by a tasty au poivre sauce, the scallops were like buttah and served with a terribly cute mini pumpkin stuffed with some kind of magic rice pilaf, and the prime rib was HUGE. Like, HUUUUUUGE. People stared. I thought we were on a Man vs. Food episode. The man reports that it was out of this world and exactly what he was hoping for.And for dessert...the red berry bibble! Because when it's called a bibble, how are you supposed to resist? Turns out it's basically a fruit compote topped with creme fraiche and it's shockingly, lip-smackingly good. Our server was dismayed to find that the kitchen hadn't provided a birthday candle, so he brought out a slice of key lime pie as well. By this point, we were all so full we were unbuttoning our pants, so we only managed a bite each of that. But what a bite it was!The experience was quite an investment, but so worth it for those special people and special occasions in your life.",8,0.9951
1122,8,5,4.0,"Having been raised by Russian/Ukranian immigrants and a Polish nanny, I felt like it was a right of passage for me to check out Veselka on the East Village. And finally I seized the chance to make my cultural pilgrimage with my good ol' friend and fellow Yelper, Maeve C. And we had a jolly old time! First of all, I love the space. I think it's adorably cozy and spacious at the same time, and the waiters and hosts are extremely friendly and accomodating. The borscht was true to form and excellent, though I was disappointed that they didn't serve it with sour cream on the side by default. And the fried pierogies were very tasty even if they weren't the most authentic (which they weren't). My nanny used to serve up pierogies with caramelized onions and mushrooms, and just a tad bit pan fried, and they were much larger and much more flavorful than these. But Veselka pierogies definitely got the job done.What I like about Veselka is that even if you're not in the mood for a Ukranian spin on your food, you can still order off of their fairly varied menu and get a delicious American meal. I happened to also have the lentil salad with feta cheese, and it was phenomenal. I also couldn't help but notice how succulent their burgers looked as other people ordered them.I think I will definitely be dragging others here in the near future to try out the other treats on their menu.",9,0.967

That doesn't sound sexy, does it?)When my friend said he'd meet me there and it was right off of the 238th Street stop, I was a bit apprehensive, aimed with my Google Map on my phone, ready to explore a seedy neighborhood. But did he lie? I am pleased to say he did not. Though the facade didn't pop out at me right away amongst the other buildings in a fairly mediocre neighborhood, it was there! The subway station was a mere few paces away. The interior is wood-laden, with many a TV showing various sports. A little distracting to the person (such as I) that hates sports but am drawn to watch them if five televisions around me are showing a Yankees game. There was ample space at the bar with plenty of tables all around. Similar to Pony Bar, there are rotating selections of beers (and even cider!) on draught. A menu, though I did not try it, looked promising, with basic burgers and sandwiches along with friend mac & cheese and even falafel! On a future visit, I'll have to give some menu items a whirl. Still, my broke ass enjoyed my $4 Harpoon Cider and bowl of complementary popcorn. Also, props to the bartender that kept us waiting a hair past 7 p.m. for our drinks.

I mean who knew on this hilly street, next to an old tenement building and around the corner is a bunch of funeral homes - lays this cupcake place. It's really a hole in the wall. From the outside you would only see a marker board with their cake and frosting flavors written on it. Then on the right of the board you make an entrance and you will find yourself at the bottom of the stairs. This is pretty interesting.Climbed the steep stairs and found myself in front of a case of beautifully made cupcakes before my eyes. The two guys running this place was pretty nice. There was a buy 5 get 1 free deal, so that's exactly what I've got. I ordered black sesame, green tea, pink champagne, jasmine tea, mango and pistachio flavored cupcakes. I didn't choose the frosting because the dude said he'll choose them for me, I guess it's like a surprise frosting. I mean afterall, I do like sweet surprises, so sure why not.Based on my tastebuds, I know I've got green tea, lychee, strawberry champagne, lemon, orange buttercream and mango frosting flavors. Okay, it was also with the help from looking at the list of frosting they have on their website and matching them with each bite I took from the cupcakes*. The cupcakes were not too sweet and it was soft. The frosting was not overly sweet and it was fluffy. These cupcakes are actually pretty good. I like the whole concept of having cupcakes with an Asian twist to it.I also gotten their mango cheesecake. Their cheesecake was more like a personal size cheesecake, which was pretty cute. the mango cheesecake wasn't too sweet either and it was pretty good. It wasn't so much like a Junior's cheesecake, where it's heavy, but it was rather light and fluffy. There's so many other flavor cupcakes and frosting that I would love to try!*I didn't eat all the cupcakes and cheesecake alone. I shared them all with my sister.

1125,21,15,4.0,"NERD BAR!A night at Booker & Dax is like nerding out while acting like an 8 year old who just wants to play with toys and light shit on fire. And getting drunk. This is what happens when David Chang and Dave Arnold (Director of Culinary Technology the French Culinary Institute) open a bar.Make you a nice winter warmer with a 1,500 degree hot poker? (!!!FIRE!!!) Chill your glass with liquid nitrogen sir?Without question, there is no bar quite like this. For starters, I have never in my life, seen a bartender SO AFRAID TO USE equipment behind their own bar. They are still getting familiar with some of Dave's toys. But it's not all flash, and these aren't just tricks. There are some serious drinks being served up too. And not all of them are space age either. The Banana Justino seems ridiculously simple compared to some things. But it might be the best thing on the menu. It's Ron Zacapa 23 Rum that has been run through a centrifuge with Fresh Bananas. Nothing else. No Sweetness. No Bitter. Pour it over a large rock. And you know what? It's outstanding. The Banana sweetens it up just enough, and then it's rich, earthy, clean and light all at the same time. The Gin and Juice. The nice backbone of overproofed Tanqueray gin is mixed with clarified Grapefruit Juice and then carbonated on the spot. So clean. Almost like a bizzaro French 75 in a way because the excessive bubbles you get are more akin to champagne than your average soda water.The Mustachi-Ode is a Mix of Amaro, Becherovka, Bourbon, Pistachio and Egg White. All Herbs, Earth and nuts sweetened and frothed up like a sort of half-way dessert cocktail. And I don't mean that in a bad way. It's a great closing drink.Now lets light some shit on Fire!After trying 3 of the 4 hot drink options, I can honestly say I liked them all. The Friend of the Devil is a must for all Negroni fans, as it's basically a hot Negroni with a touch of Absinthe and a whole lotta heat. The French Colombian is a healing mixture of Pernod, Cinnamon and Brown Sugar. The Hindenburg, with Cognac, Bitters and Abbey Ale is like a cross between Beer and Mulled Wine. If I had one complaint at all, it's that they have no hot rum drinks. FOOD:Well, you knew they'd excel here. David Chang does the food, so how bad could it be? The famous pork (belly) buns that have been here since this was Milk Bar are still readily available. On top of that they serve Chicharron Jacks, which taste like elevated Cracker Jacks, and many other pork centric offerings. On the downside, Veggies, you have only pickles to choose from. It's not the most comfortable or alluring of bars on the atmosphere front. I wouldn't want to be here all night. But for a few drinks and some Pork Buns after work or late night, I would come back for sure. Overall this was a great experience. Not just for the tricks (they were fun), but because you can get a really good drink here that almost no one else could make you. And that's worth the price of admission.

While it's a bit on the pricier side (for someone with a budget as small as mine), the pre-fixe was a nice splurge.Got the bloody mary, which was delicious! Spicy, smooth, just right. And it got me pretty buzzed. I don't think that coffee was included, which I found weird. My friend and I decided to both order egg dishes for our entrees, and for our sides one of us ordered bacon and the other ordered the poundcake.Now, this poundcake sounded SUPREMELY boring on the menu, especially alongside the other delicious-sounding options, but the server suggested it. Jesus, they need to rename it, because it was amazing! Not anything like any poundcake I've ever tried, that's for sure. It was sweet, fresh, cakey but not heavy, and so yummy.Bacon was pretty solid. Both of our egg dishes (my friend had the basil and goat cheese omelet, I had the mushroom and spinach omelet which they happily subbed pecorino in for gruyere) were good.

1127,17,10,4.0,"This is one sandwich shop that knows how to do things right.At first I was a bit alarmed at the long line, but I saw that it was moving quickly. I was ordering within two minutes. It's a small shop with no place to sit in the inside, only a counter along the wall for you to stand and eat. Most people choose to take their sandwiches elsewhere. What's brilliant about their design, is that you stand in line to order OUTSIDE at their window. This may be a pain when it's really hot (or raining, maybe they let people in then, I don't know). After you order, then you go in to pick up your sandwich. This means that the inside isn't crowded with people and there's a long twisting line that you need to fight with inside the shop. The sandwich making is super fast too. I ordered and I barely stepped in (indeed I hadn't even gotten a chance to put my wallet back in my purse) when they called out my order number.A freshly made grilled peach sandwich was already waiting for me at the counter. Yes, grilled peach sandwich. Of all the possible fillings that one could imagine, I never would dreamed of peach, but when I about this in Time Out and Serious Eats, I knew I had to get one before the summer ended.Num Pang is the less famous cousin of the Vietnam's bahn mi. Every sandwich is garnished with spicy mayo, thin slices of cucumber, shredded carrots, and cilantro on a warm crusty toasted roll. At Num Pang, they have a draconian policy of no changes, no substitutions, no additions, nada. You need to order the sandwich as is. In part, they know how they want to feed you the sandwich. The other thing is that it makes the sandwich making process a lot faster as they don't need to think about ""Oh, what do I need to take out/add in/etc. for this sandwich?""As for my grilled peach sandwich, it was delectable. Two thick juicy slices and bacon were tucked into a a toasted roll with all the fixings. The sandwich was exactly the right size. Big enough to satisfy your hunger, but not so big that you can't eat it all in one sitting. And the price was right ($7.50). I thought they should have added more bacon or used a thicker smokier cut of bacon for the sandwich, because one thin little piece was lost on its own with the peaches and everything else. The bites were more of the bacon overlapped had a right balance of sweet and salty, soft and crispy from the peach and bacon.I also got a blood orange lemonade. The lemonade was a bright orangey pink color from the blood orange juice. I found the drink too watered down and couldn't really taste the blood oranges. I would skip this drink in favor of something else next time.Num Pang serves novel, inventive, and fresh take on the traditional Cambodian sandwiches. They have several different kinds (classics that are always on the menu and seasonal, which rotate in and out of the season). All looked amazingly good.

It famously resembles a tattoo parlor. 'Ed Hardy makes my head-suit,' I practiced saying to Jack as leather-vested Allie lathered my hair. I asked her -as the first white girl to touch my hair in 28 years- if the common knowledge that 'only Asians can cut Asian hair' was a conspiracy rumor propagated by the Asian haircutting community. She declined to take a strong position. Allie gave me a nice haircut. Stylistic differences are minimal (turns out my inner head-suit still favors Chinatown), but she put some lovely product in it following, and offered to trim my bangs for free any time (apparently, that's par for course. Salons! Who knew-). My head-suit is legit, and I've probably crossed a threshold that it would be inappropriate to regress from.

1136,21,11,4.0,"Having found Paletas in Manhattan ( La Newyorkina ) and in Queens ( Tortilleria Nixtamal ) it was only time that I came across Sley in Brooklyn. Paletas, Mexican ice Popsicles usually consisting of fruit juices and chunks of actual fruits, are one of the specialties at this little shop that appears to be an old grocery store from the outside. From what I've gathered off the internet, Sley's paletas are sold at other Mexican groceries and restaurants but this is the source where they originate from.Staring in through the glass of the freezer, one of the managers (owner?) saw that I was intensely trying to figure out which flavors to get because of the overwhelming varieties of paletas inside ( I was told there was over 30 ). Figuring out that it was my first time there, he suggested that I try the butter pecan.Me while nibbling: This is pretty good. Real creamy and smooth with lots and lots of large chunks of pecans inside. How much is it?Him: $1 each but we'll give you 24 in a box for $20.Me: Nice. So could I mix and match or I could only get one flavor per box?Him: You could get whatever you want.Me: Ok. So that means I need to get 23 more after eating this one.Him: Nooo... that one I give you. Free.That was real nice of him, especially since he gave it to me even before I decided to buy anything. The next few minutes had me picking out the flavors that seems most intriguing. The manager (owner?) was understandably real proud of his paletas and we had a nice conversation about it. The conversation got so deep that I lost count of how many I gave him to put in the box.Me: Um... I lost count. Did I give you 24 or 25?Him: 25Me: Oh.... Let me put one back then. Him: No. It's OK. I give you 25.What? Wow. I give this place 5 stars for customer service. Between the 3 places of Paletas that I've try so far, this one is better than La Newyorkina which was too icy but not as good as the ones found at Tortilleria Nixtamal which was smoother and have bigger chunks of fruits. The smaller fruits is forgivable in light of the fact that those were $2 each while these are only $1 ( or less if you buy it in a box like I did ). Before I wrote this review, I also tried Strawberry Ice Cream (Fresa), and Mango w/ Chili Ice ( Mango con Chile ). The strawberry Ice cream was creamily smooth with a decent amount of strawberry pieces inside. The Mango w/ Chili was more juicy, icy,and sweet from chunks of mango with a pleasant heat from the chili spices. They both tasted delicious and cooling on a warmer spring day.From my experience, the fruit juice only based Pops are not as good as the milk based ones so start with those.Although most of the ingredients from what I've read on the labels are natural, some people might want to be aware of the fact that they do use food coloring and natural mixed with artificial vanilla flavoring to create some of the Popsicles.*********************************************Update: Get the coconut flavor and rice flavor if they have them.

We had stopped by Reunion, but for some reason it was packed to the brim and they were playing their West Coast Pandora radio station at 120 decibels.So, I went into my Yelp app and typed in ""Happy Hour."" The first two places that come up (while standing in Hell's Kitchen) are Reunion and Barrage. I had never heard of this place, ""Barrage,"" but the top three quotes said, '...great place for happy hour...'Perfect!It was shortly after we had our drinks in hand, Mike with a gin and tonic and I with a draught Yeungling, that I began to notice my surroundings. ""Odd that there are no women here,"" I thought to myself, squinting. The reality dawned on us rather quickly, so I suppose the remainder of our silence on the subject was purely out of denial.""You realize we're in a gay bar, right?"" Mike asks.""Yeah. Should we leave?"" I inquire, hesitantly.""Well, they already have my credit card.""So with that, Mike and I enjoyed several drinks and a long happy hour at a gay bar. It was only then that I understood the ramifications of the name, ""Barrage,"" which I can truly appreciate in retrospect. We were waited on by a youthful character in cutoff jeans who was so light on his feet you would swear he floated from table to table. The drinks had sumptuous names like ""The Cock Ring."" The decor was trendy and modern, appropriately neo-Hell's Kitchen. I'll admit, I found it less than thrilling to use a urinal in the restroom while surrounded by gay pornography on the walls, but by my 4th beer I think I was subconsciously analyzing the photographs as I compared the size of my member to that of male pornographic models. I came out ok.If this weren't a gay bar, I'd go back in a second: Barrage is, overall, an awesome spot. Honestly, I may be back anyhow. I couldn't help but feel like everyone knew Mike and I didn't belong, though. Maybe it's paranoia, but that tingly feeling of being the elephant in the room made it hard to completely relax. That said, a good spot is a good spot: if you're gay, you owe it to yourself to give Barrage a try; if you're a woman, here's an awesome place you can go and not get hit on by douche bags. If that isn't a solid endorsement, I don't know what is.",21,0.9971
1138,18,13,4.0,"As the chilly weather sets in, the temptation to kvetch and complain like any regular New Yorker is irresistible. One of the great ways that shifts the focus from kvetching about the cold is to think of those delectable dishes that are wonderful on the taste buds during the cold weather. Xiao Long Bao (pronounced ""shao long bow"" as in take a bow) or soup dumplings is decidedly one of those savory treats perfect when the days are shorter and the nights are longer. So, when my best friend inquired what I wanted him to get for me from Chinatown, I directed him to Shanghai Cafe's xiao long bao. When it got to my dinner table, the eight (8) pieces of xiao long bao were still hot but just right so as not to scald the tongue. There are two (2) ways of eating xiao long bao: one is to place one xiao long bao on a spoon, bite the edge, slurp the soup and half of the filling. Another way of eating it is to place one xiao long bao on a spoon, get the whole thing in, bite it and savor the burst of a little broth in your taste buds, and chew the rest of it.  Just remember not to talk as this process of digestion commences, as it is not exactly a delicate sight to behold. :)  The reason I'm a fan of the xiao long bao at this place is that it is flavorful and yet not oily. The broth inside as well as the size of the dumpling itself is just right. At a little less than five dollars; alright, $4.95 if you want me to be precise about it, that savory treat of broth inside the dumpling is the perfect comfort food on a cold night. :)",18,0.9914
1139,46,34,4.0,"The French are coming!!The French are coming!!Lace up your sneakers, pick up a pair of dumbbells and take a few laps around the pool because the French invasion has begun. I'm talking about French pastries of course! No matter how hard I kick, run or lift in my battle of the bulge there's a devious Frenchman opening a patisserie in New York. They test my will power by seducing me with butter, sugar and classic technique. Payard threw open his doors last spring with a downtown location. Mille Feuille started off as the spunky kid on the block this summer with its superb offerings of croissants. Let's not forget Maison Ladurée who has invoked a cultish sense of panic among macaron lovers on the UES. Dominique Ansel and his namesake bakery look certain to carry on the caloric offensive with his competently prepared and whimsical Gallic goods.The shop, which takes over the old Cafe Rheon space in Soho, has been doing a brisk trade in sweet treats and savory items since opening in the fall. If there is a signature draw, it is the Kouign Amann, a specialty from the Breton region. My friends, Mr. Enabler and Mrs. Perfectionist, opened my eyes to it recently and I am grateful for this bit of French enlightenment. The DKA (certainly a more appealing acronym than a DSK!) is best described to novices as a caramelized croissant. Shaped like a crown, this stately pastry consists of layers of sugary crusty pastry that give way to a soft, tender center. It's buttery, rich and insanely good. Weighing in at $5.25, the DKA is a splurge best appreciated when fresh out of the oven. Additionally, the friendly staff may point you in the direction of the Cannelé, another pastry worthy of your attention. The mini cake sports a deep hued crunchy exterior that yields to an eggy and luscious inside. Texturally, I think their version is pretty spot on but I would have liked a little more oomph and jazz from the rum and vanilla flavoring. If you're not a fan of puff pastry, the store has a host of other baked goods to satisfy your sweet tooth. Their bunny loaf is a cute, cheerful take on carrot cake. This iteration had a moist batter and a light cream cheese icing but I wanted a little more than a whisper of spices. Serious chocolate lovers should definitely consider the Mini-me cake. Layers of fabulous flourless chocolate cake come interspersed with pillowy chocolate mousse. Mini meringues on top add a crunchy contrast to this airy, chocolate mass. I don't really care for their savory offerings; my chicken soup was bland and the sandwiches and salads are little pricey to justify for a light lunch. Also, the narrow setup at the front makes ordering somewhat chaotic and confusing at times. Take refuge at the back in their greenhouse seating if you are staying. Overall, the decor is little too stark and lacks warmth. The behavior and habits of some of their patrons is irksome. I'm referring to the Yuppie couple who dared to cast disdainful judgment on my shabby get up during my initial visit. What do you nitwits know about good taste?Anywhoo.As far as precious, decadent pastries are concerned, this bakery merits repeat visits from me. Friends, get the butter because resistance is futile.",49,0.9966
1140,6,33,4.0,"There is something ominous about the fork lifts out front and their 6 foot rectangular bales of vintage awesomeness, like the tip of some Murakamian iceberg of secrets. How they fill this massive space with unique, great finds is a provocative mystery to me.In the back they've got a cool selection of knick-knacks and what-nots. My buddy found a framed poster of Michael Jordan in the 45 jersey for $10 but the real reason you come here is for the clothes. Every few months I spend about $30 here to keep me on maximum handsome.Be weary of buying clothes that look cool in a thrift store but turn weirdo the instant you take them from their natural habitat. Happens all the time. Also, when you get home tie your new clothes up in a plastic bag and throw them in the freezer for five hours, that will kill any bed bugs.Relevant side note: One time I stepped into a shoe that had barf in it.",20,-0.6652
1141,26,22,4.0,"From the swanky bar with the fountain of stone at the entrance, to the semi-enclosed elegant wooden booths, to the real bamboo plants all around, to the general attention for details, this restaurant certainly doesn't feel like your average Chinese joint[1].Ambiance aside, the food is solid. I don't particularly like chicken, but their house special chicken (half for $9, whole for $18) is simple and tender, with a nice, crispy skin. The sauteed snow pea leaves with garlic ($11.95) was the perfect side for this dish.For congee, both the pig's blood congee ($2.95) and sliced fish and preserved egg congee ($3.95) were excellent.The star of the show, however, is the house special chilled[2] Dungeness crab in Chao style, which is part of the ""Gong Xi Fa Cai Family Dish"" banquet special.I can only describe this dish as non-edulcorated orgasm with a biomineralized exoskeleton of calcium carbonate!I came here with two other friends, and this is what we had:Tsing TaoDungeness crab Chao stylehalf house special chickencongee with pig bloodcongee with sliced fish and preserved eggpea shootsred bean paste with lily consommeTotal: $29 per person.Minus one star for being out of xiao long bao and flan.----------------------------------------[1] Rest assured, though: a visit to the restrooms will bring you back to earth.

A friend wanted soupy noodles but not ramen, so I yelped for help and found this secret gem!The portions are hugeeeeeee...the noodles came in bowls the size of face basins! My friend had the spicy noodles and polished it all up. I had myself the ginseng spring chicken soup which was really...'bland' in the good healthy way. I am drooling just writing this review. It took a while to prepare but so worth the wait, they stuff the chicken with rice and then boil/stew/cook it in this ginseng soup. Soooooooo good!!! It comes with salt, peppers and garlic. I just used soy sauce for the chicken. The seafood pancake was very nicely done too...alot of spring onions but I ate it anyway. Definitely my new favorite Korean/noodle spot in the city! Oh, ginseng chicken...I am coming back for you!Tip-bits:Only 5 people in the elevator- skinny ones at that.Bathroom is off to the left, by a desk/table/register?Cold barley tea is what they serve by default, but you can ask for hot one too",16,0.9915
1143,16,14,4.0,"Don't go here if you drink Amstel Light.Don't go here if you're claustrophobic.Don't go here if statues of little peeing boys in bathrooms freak you out a little bit.(On that note, don't go to Brussels either)I am amazed by how the space rolls out. A couple of tables lay strewn just as you enter, and there are little seats by the bar all the way to the back. On your way to the back, you'll notice little nooks and crannies into which people, large and small, have ensconced themselves. At the very back, grunge meets classy in a chandelier lit corner, with ornate velvet paper adorning the walls. It's all a bit carefully careless. The one-page beer menu at this little rabbit hole is kind of like the space in a way, quite constrained. They're not trying to go all crazy like rattle and hum or downtown bar and grill. What it lacks in variety though, it makes up in quality.The brews are mostly belgian, and usually excellent. Tell me you tried the St. Bernadus and the Rochefort 10 and did not love it, and I won't believe you. The bartenders are understated and perceptive, which is a nice complement to with the mood and the music of the Old Rabbit Hole (Yep, I refuse to call it the rabbit club).I don't even recall the number of times my husband and I have dropped in for a couple while we're in the area, and nor do I remember the last time I got to plonk myself on a seat without a bit of a struggle. I have had to do everything from sneaking in near a party and slowly encroaching on their space to standing in the narrow passage and totally blocking everyone's way. All's fair in beer and war.. but get here early for a clean conscience.",15,0.8157
1144,23,30,4.0,"I've been bitten by dogs three times throughout my life and all three bites were from Chihuahuas. Awful, bug-eyed, shaky, nervous, yappy little cretins that no grown man should own. They're like something that was born in the trash cans of a LES Chinese restaurant.The Chihuahua at Crif dog is the opposite. It's loyal, welcoming, brave and always there for you in your time of need. It is a prime example of stoner cookery. Something dreamed up at 1AM in between bong hits while watching Predator 2 on tv and wondering why you can't remember other movies that Danny Glover has been in other than this and Lethal Weapon 1-4.

1145,14,18,4.0,"If you come to El Rio Grande and do not order a margarita and/or steak nachos, you're doing it wrong. By this logic, I did everything a little too right the other night, if you know what I mean... From the first sip of my Marge*, I knew I was in trouble. Despite being super strong, their signature libation somehow remains totally drinkable and refreshing and devoid of that sharp alcohol sting. One (or five) of these will do some damage, providing any and all with a brand of hammered that shows no mercy or discrimination, inebriating recent college grads, cougars, suits, woo girls, and even adult males in their mid-to-late twenties who write Yelp reviews for their own self-gratification. We all must bow before the Rio Margarita.As for the steak nachos (or officially, Nachos de Fajita), where do I begin? First off, do not picture the typical messy, tornado-aftermath mountain of tortilla, meat, cheese and salsa. Because when El Rio Grande's steak nachos were being first raved about to me, I pictured exactly that and couldn't have been less excited. Then, I see that these nachos have been individually constructed - each chip with a generous and juicy-delicious chunk of perfectly grilled steak, rested on a bed of refried beans, guacamole, jalapeños, and cheese - and I nearly lost my shit. These nachos brought out the monster in me, as they did the rest of my happy hour crew, which included one self-professed health-nut of a companion who broke his diet to decimate these things, as well as anyone who may have stood in his path.The rest of my experience here was a bit of a blur, but no less of a blast. It can get awfully crowded during happy hour (the outdoor seating helps in the summer months), and without their two signature offerings, one might argue El Rio Grande could be most any other Murray Hill booze joint. Thankfully, it isn't. Well, that and it's got a giant stuffed animal buffalo with wings suspended over the bar. A few Margies more and I might've been tryin' to fly that thing home...*Calling margaritas Ritas is so 2010.",14,-0.5915
1146,24,16,4.0,"Oh hey, honey. Come on down to SoCo for some comfy breakfast food on your hungover Sunday mornin'.This place is ginormous. Huge. There is a little DJ booth in the front, along with a bar, that opens up to the hugest dining room I have seen in Brooklyn. Plus, there is a back patio. All this space and a tiny kitchen and the place was almost completely full on a Sunday afternoon. Whoa.The red velvet waffles that everyone is talking about were pretty good, but it was the bourbon maple syrup (totally the real deal, no Aunts were involved in the making of this stuff) that made it worth the whole trip. To get those waffles you HAVE to order it with the chicken, a bummer since I prefer eggs in the am, but since I came all the way just for those, I ordered a side of scrambled eggs and shut my mouth. And by shut my mouth, I mean I opened it to down the best grits I have ever tasted -- I even said : these taste like I'm eating clouds. So fluffy and just the right mix of cheesy and egg-y and grits-y. The fried chicken was not greasy at all and had a nice, sweet corn, flaky crispy outside. Perfect, when dipped in that bourbon maple syrup.The portions were huge, so great to share. The coffee was ok but presented so adorably on its own little tray with bamboo leaves holding it in to place, I can forgive them for it not being better.They also serve some hard to find New Orleans beer.Plus! 20% off with your check in on Yelp!",30,0.9936
1147,8,6,4.0,"The old Torrisi is one of my lunch time favorites for chicken parm and some delicious antipasto... brussels sprouts and cauliflower and all sorts of wonderful Italian goodies. I anticipate their brisk sandwich trade will continue in the new space next door, Parm. The new annex is dominated by a lunch counter with cheerful red stools, and the fun slightly Italiancized 1950's diner vibe compliments the more rustic trattoria-esque digs at the original.I saw a picture of their meatball parm hero, with a giantic meatball covered in fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce and basil leaves on eater, and I knew instantly what my first Parm order would be (gotta get parm at Parm, right?). Like all their other sandwiches, it was out of this world good: tender, moist meatball, gooey mozzarella, garlicky tomato sauce... The only thing I wish was that there was more cheese on it, since there's nothing like good fresh mozzarella, and they are using some quality cheese at Parm. They still have their stand out brussels sprouts and all of the old Torrisi lunch menu favorites, but they've added some stuff. Since I try to stick to a ten dollar and under lunch budget and my sandwich was already $11, I didn't get anything else, but the man sitting next to me tweeting photos of his lunch actually shared one of his deep fried pizza knots with me. I thought they would be like deep fried garlic knots, but the truth was they were more akin to savory zeppoles, slathered with parsley and garlic. The texture was surprisingly akin to a fresh donut. It was unusual and tasty, but could have done with some tomato sauce for dipping. Parm isn't doing take out til later this week, so there's definitely a bit of a wait for food, but service is pleasant and the wait for a seat was only 15 to 20 minutes, which is still reasonable. The prices are a bit on the high side for lunch, with full sandwiches clocking in at $11, not factoring tax and tip, which bought my hero up to $14. It makes a pretty expensive meal, especially if you want to try any of their wonderful sides. A good option is to split a sandwich and some antipasto with a friend. If Parm was nice, they would sell half sandwich antipasto combos. They do have smaller roll sandwiches, but only for a dollar less, and the rolls are the squishy, slightly sweet kind, which I don't really like, and have a difficult time standing up to hefty fillings. Sell half sandwiches for $6 on the regular hero bread and I will give you a fifth star, Parm!All that being said, the warm vibe and wonderful food make it an excellent occasional lunchtime splurge, and I am looking forward to their nightly special dinner plates, which will apparently start in a few weeks and include aged steak, Chinese food and a Thanksgiving dinner.",10,0.9981
1148,13,4,4.0,"4.5 stars...The New York Public Library is a huge system of 87 locations spread out throughout Manhattan, Staten Island, and the Bronx, but this listing is for the main branch (the Stephen A Schwarzman building). This historic 1911 building is the largest public library in the country and has so much more to it than just a library. I'm not a big reader and haven't been to a library to check out a book since grade school but I still love this place. The first thing that stands out is the architecture. Between the iconic stone lions flanking the main entrance to the impressive columned front facade, or the breathtaking interior, it's impossible not to be impressed with the building. Essentially the backyard of the library is Bryant park, a beautiful little park with lots of events and places to enjoy the weather while sitting at an iron table under the trees or on the field steps away from the fountain (which can become a movie theater, concert venue, fashion show, shopping mall, or ice skating rink depending on when you go). Beyond the interior and exterior of the building you get into the business of the place. If you've ever come here to get a book you've learned several crucial things. First is that this is one of the system's four non-lending research libraries so you can stay and read all you want (but you aren't leaving the library with any of the books). Second is that you don't fumble around trying to remember the dewey decimal system to locate a book, you go to one of the librarians who calls up your book for you. If you'd rather use one of their computers to do research (aka facebook) you may have to wait for one for a while depending on what time you go but it is free (you're better off going to the Apple Store if it's something you need to do quickly). Coming to this library you have access to checking out one of the most extensive collections of just about everything, from historical maps in the map room, to rare books, and everything in between (I hear they'll even copy whatever map you want for $30, I'm assuming it's better quality than a photo copy but I'm not sure, feel free to contact me if you've had this done). I came here primarily for two reasons. The first is to see the original Winnie the Pooh, Eeyore, Tigger. Piglet, and Roo. That's right, the original ones owned by the real Christopher Robin Milne who's father (A.A Milne) bought for him and later wrote tales about in 1925. They look nothing like the characters we grew up with but that's ok, it's still cool. They're located in a glass case down in the children's area on the ground floor. The second reason I came in was to check out their 100 year anniversary exhibit where they've taken many of their most valuable and recognizable permanent collection pieces, as well as other pieces on loan and combined them into a sort of best of show that has nothing to do with the NYPL but communication and literature in general. Like everything else it's free and you'll see things like: -The Guttenberg Bible: The first major book published with movable type. It was created by it's inventor, Johannes Gutenberg in Germany between 1452-1455. 180 were made, 48 have survived, and this copy was the first to be brought to the US in 1847 and is in remarkable condition)-Music written by Ludwig van Beethoven -Draft of the Declaration of Independence hand written by Thomas Jefferson-Hand written letter by George Washington-First published copy of the Star Spangled Banner (1815)-Charles Dickens' personal copy of David Copperfield (with hand written notes) and letter opener-First edition of John James Audubon's Birds of America (another copy of this book set a world record for highest price book when it sold for 11.4 million in London last year)-Original William Wallace Denslow illustrations for the Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) Those were just eight of the hundreds of items on display. Everything from typewriters of famous writers, to maps, personal belongings, and more. Definitely worth coming to the library just for this exhibit alone.",21,0.9985
1149,22,31,4.0,"Let's get personal for a second: When's the last time you cried while you were eating?Now, I don't mean you were crying because your partner just left you, or that you stubbed your toe really bad on the way back to the couch with that Hot Pocket or whatever. I'm talking about really profuse, public weeping. And sweating. And maybe some coughing. Okay, scratch that: definitely some coughing. For me, it was last night because I made the trip back to New World Mall for a bowl of Mala Tang (Ma La Tang? Malatang? no idea.) For $5-7 depending on what flavor you want your liquid death to be served with, you can get down with foods that your white ass has probably never even seen. Oh, and it's going to be so hot it makes you feel like you just made out with the Sun.Gourds? Yeah I made a bird house out of one when I was 7. And I'm pretty sure I haven't seen one since, until I ate part of one last night in my soup. And you know what? It was delicious.Some kind of mushroom that looked like a mummified testicle? Yeah, I ate that too. Strips of seaweed so fresh there were fish humping near them a few days ago? Down the hatch, bro. Seriously, I never fancied myself to be a masochist but there's something oddly appealing about eating food that's the same color red as a nuclear fallout warning sign.So I guess what I'm trying to say is, next time you see me crying while I walk down the street, do me a favor and let's both pretend it's because I was just eating here. I mean, it's not like I still get emotional sometimes thinking about when Buffy the Vampire Slayer got cancelled.",13,-0.7988
1150,10,10,4.0,"If Molly's cupcakes was a bar, I think I'd drink there every day. Instead of cocktails or beer, they are purveyors of cupcakes so I'd limit my intake or up my gym visits significantly. I can easily see a scenario where in an act of generosity inspired by the sheer delicious combination of cake and frosting, I say ""Bar keep, another round for everyone!"" while the staff obliges and teeters on calling security to escort a food coma drunk out of the building.I stumbled by here accidentally en route to Cafe Espanol on Bleeker. Post Film Forum, we circled back and entered a brightly lit, sparkling clean interior with a swing you can sit at! Yes, a swing! But that's not all for ambiance as there's also a wide selection of board games!Scrabble, trivial pursuit and more were readily available. One caveat is that a lengthy game of scrabble may require 4-5 cupcake poundage.I also liked the easy access to fill your own tap water. Yes, bottled is available but NYC taxpayer funded tap is fine by me.So enough of the establishment's interior, let's talk cupcake interiors.Peanut Butter Nutella. Like Mt. Rushmore or the Grand Canyon, there's a bewildering majesty found from putting those three words together. Now imagine eating a cupcake with those ingredients.First , the cake, which was the peanut butter part. I never had a cake part of a cupcake that tasted this good before. It could stand alone and all Molly cupcakes are actually available as sheet cakes.So I bite into the cupcake, experience the peanut butter cake and am also greeted by an interior treat of nutella. And to top it all off there's frosting of buttercream nutella.Forks are available for those who want to continue as members of society. I dropped out of polite society, eschewing convention and used my hands to deliver this cupcake of the gods into my mouth. I just had to lick the remaining buttercream off of the baking cup. My experience of the seasonal pumpkin spice cupcake was also overall positive although I preferred the pb and nutella. Composed of spice cake, pumpkin mascarpone center and sweet cream cheese frosting, I found the cream cheese a bit too sweet. Once again, an excellent cake part of the cupcake.By the end of round two, I was down for the count though lusted after other cupcakes through the counter- chocolate mousse, tiramisu, peach cobbler, minty mash up and so many more.And eating at Molly's is doing good through gluttony.

1151,8,0,4.0,"In my short time inside this small shop, I only saw people come in for freshly baked bread, but the reason I like it more than other Georgian bakeries is the decent selection of salads and hot dishes they can prepare as well, all for takeout.The star of the bakery are definitely the shoti long ($2), which were flying off the shelves as I was lingering over my selections. Shoti are in essence the Georgian version of a baguette that is long and shaped like a canoe. I gravitate towards khachapuri ($5.50, round), a baked cheese bread that Georgian cooking is famous for. They also sell khachapuri puffs here, but the problem with all of this is that it seems a bit tired. While the shoti are popular for taking home and eating with any meal and constantly popping out of the brick oven, these might be sitting around for a while.Also good for taking home are the meat pies ($3.50), which can come in potato, bean (lobani), mushroom tarragon, and cabbage versions as well. The breads are nice and chewy, and a bit on the greasy side.You might be asked to check out their arrangements of cold salads or your eyes might naturally avert themselves to this refrigerated case anyways, but the options are worth giving a try. The salad olivie ($6.99/lb) is not specifically Georgian but is very good here.The more Georgian options are versions of satsivi, a sauce made out of walnuts that is used with chicken, or other salads that use walnuts. They all look delicious. The prepared hot dishes also looked pretty tasty, but on this hot day the cold dishes appealed much more.

I perused the single malt and whiskey menu and settled on Laphroiag 10yr. (I wished they had the quarter cask) while my companion had an Irish flight of whiskies (sorry, I prefer peaty whiskies). They also give you a tiny cask/pitcher of water to add to your whisky, if you need it, which I thought was a nice touch. We sat and sipped and took our time. Because that's how you're supposed to drink whisky my friend. Perhaps it is my Scottish heritage that influences my affinity for whisky (sorry Irish side of my heritage), I know I'll definitely be back.*Please tell me you get that reference.

1153,14,8,4.0,"Like good live Jazz (I do)? Like World Class Cocktails? You've found the Motherlode.Another jewel has been added to the Petraske empire. And this one is sophisticated for sure. Silver Lining is the lovechild of Sasha Petraske and Vito Dieterle, who moonlights as a sexy saxman saxogramist himself. (If only I could get Vito to play me Careless Whisper!)Unlike many of the better drinking dens in this city, Silver Lining is unapolegitically a place to act like a grown up (Let's get all white tablecloth up in here!). This is where it excels, this is why you should come. Many of the best bars in this city are actually quite casual. Probably because the East Village is the most concentrated section of good drinking on the planet. But you know what? Sometimes I want to get all fancy with my friends and chill out to some good live music. And I'd like to do so while having a cocktail up to my standards (sorry B-Flat, you lose). Aside from a formidable lineup of trio and quartet jazz (starts at 9 on weekdays, 10 on weekends), they have a very formidable lineup of bartenders as well. Some of the best bartenders from Little Branch, Dutch Kills and Milk and Honey do shifts here, and accordingly there should be no problem with ordering drinks off menu to suit your taste. Lovely appetizers and desserts as well.Overall, this is an elegant jazz club/cocktail lounge that doesn't sacrifice quality on any front.

What you need is the perfect sized ration, and the robust and swashbuckwheat energy of Soba: enter Cocoron.As you enter the minuscule hole in the wall you'll be subdued by the visual zen; the wood panelling and furniture cleverly arranged in proportion to the very limited space. The chef counter occupying the prominence with the tiny tables in elliptical orbit, scarcely leaving space for any human locomotion, and yet, the birch veneer and other well-thought details trump over claustrophobia, making you feel utter relaxation as you take your place by the exposed brick wall.A variety of Ramen and Soba options abound, you know them well, but know that Cocoron insists that presentation and taste have to go hand in hand. So I dipped and finished my measured portion of Soba on the broth, and then watched as our waitress poured over more broth and handed us a long wooden spoon for us to finish up in true Nihon countryside style. Yes, I was pleased, not too full but satisfied. I even had enough space in my tummy to indulge in the decadent flavor of their luscious black sesame cheese cake, peppered with roasted soybean powder: O-I-S-H-I D-E-S-U-Y-O !And with that, I'm off, but lest we forget that pesky -1 star caveat emptor, sadly, Cocoron is a teetotaler, but not by choice; once NYC grants them that coveted license, it'll be sake days, we promise.

I'm not a big drinker so I'm probably not very qualified to judge the drinks, but we were all very impressed - everything we tried was tasty and they definitely didn't skimp on the alcohol potency. The decor/ambiance was lovely - very upscale-tiki-bar-esque. The theme was very clear but done in a classy way that didn't seem cheesy or false. The entire place has a relaxed, understated vibe, which I particularly appreciated on the double date - we were seated upstairs at a spacious booth and were able to chat comfortably without yelling over the music. When we came back the second time, we spent more time in the downstairs area, which is essentially the lounge version of the restaurant upstairs. Even on a Saturday night, our group of 5 snagged a big table downstairs (surprisingly, the place wasn't packed at all) and we relaxed with our drinks for a couple of hours. We never felt rushed, our waitress was attentive and our evening was very pleasant overall. Lani Kai is the kind of place you can go with a wide variety of people and know that you won't be sending the wrong message, whatever that message may be. I also want to steal their chandelier for my future Mediterranean timeshare, so I'll definitely be back.",12,0.9922

Yep, that happens too.But this white, Southern, Jewish kid knows when he has something he likes, even if he doesn't exactly know what he's eating. Such was the case at Madangsui.The chicken, beef, and pork were all excellent. I'm not sure which was which, but it all tasted damn good. The veggies were good too, as were the sides that our server/BBQer supplied us with.My whole table was rookies, and our server was perfectly fine with that. She made suggestions, told us how to eat it, and didn't give us a hard time if we did something wrong. One of my dining partners even used a fork. Gasp!We all had a lot of fun and were proud to have broadened our horizons, at least a little bit.

It has a crusty, bespoke feel that I like in a independent theater. It is in an older SoHo building and the lobby has hardwood floors, is full of comfy chairs and couches, and has a coffee shop. No arcade games, no foolishness, just people reading poetry books or something and engaging in ""deep conversation"", waiting for their movie to start. The screening rooms are a bit old school, in a bad way - long narrow theaters, with relatively small screens - but who the heck cares, just sit up front and you are all good.

1158,16,6,4.0,"Lyon is the French city that everyone forgets about. It's overshadowed by the glitz of Paris and the rustic allure of Provence and the Cote d'Azur. In reality, Lyon is France's second largest city and a true epicenter for food.The bouchon is Lyon's version of the brasserie or bistro. It's a warm, simple place, usually run by a family, that serves up unpretentious woodsy food, serves wine out of pots, and treats diners to friendly service with red-white checkered napkins to boot. Lyon Bouchon Moderne, which just got a positive review in the NYTimes and is bound to enjoy a ballooning in popularity, captures the spirit of the Lyon bouchon. They get everything right, from the food to the minor details. The food is classic Lyonnais food, with quenelles, blood sausages, dried meats, salad lyonnaise, and other regional delicacies, while the restaurant itself is extremely cozy, with authentic French antiques, bistro-seating, vintage mirrors, and what-appears-to-be an imported French waitstaff.Onto the food: Charcuterie - There's something magic about being served food on a cutting board. Heaps of dried meats, sausages, terrines and pates. It sounds bourgeois, but in everyday life in Lyon, the notion of a charcuterie platter is commonplace. Salade Lyonnaise - The salade lyonnaise was extremely well executed. Bitter greens (although where's the frisee?) tossed with a tangy mustard-base vinaigrette, topped with crisp bacon lardons and a runny warm poached egg. I was seriously in heaven and wanted to lick the plate after having sampled the salade lyonnaise. My wife had to talk me out of it. Be sure to order it. Duck Rilletes on Toast - Imagine slow cooked duck, thickened with fat, and strewn across crispy baguette. Sounds like something I'd want to eat all winter long.Skate - Lyon's version of skate, which is a poor man's fish, is superlative. I would go back and order plates of it. Crispy skate, arranged in a half circle to show off the arc like shape of its body, served with a delicious concoction of butternut squash, fried sage leaves and lemon-caper butter. Highly recommend.Ravioli Maison - Pumpkin ravioli with chestnuts and sage was rich and decadent as it sounds. Perhaps it was a bit too decadent for my tastes, but I am glad that we tried it.Pain Perdu - France's version of bread budding was done better at Lyon than I have ever tasted in France. Egg soaked bread, infused with butter, white raisins and fresh vanilla, with a crispy exterior and a warm gooey interior. Extremely memorable.I know the NYTimes criticized Lyon for not having yet found its identity but I think they are missing the point. The bouchon shouldn't be a place of culinary exploration -- it should be an inexpensive place to get a sausage with a glass of Cotes du Rhone wine.Don't come here looking for a scene. Nah, it's too small for that. Also don't come looking for ""moderne"" renditions of Lyonnais food. I would actually make a case to rename the restaurant Lyon Bouchon ""Classique"". For Lyon's identity is wrapped up in its authenticity. And authenticity alone sets it apart from other places.",18,0.9856
1159,10,8,4.0,"Fun, inventive food that will keep your taste buds on their toes. Chef Mehta himself took my coat! He was very friendly, very present, greeted many guests, shook hands, etc. I'm sure he knows -- as diners, we love that. For such an avant garde, anticipated restaurant, the service felt slightly amateurish. I got the feeling that it was the first job for most of the waitstaff. Drinks took a while, and they forgot one of orders altogether. The bartender was nice but he didn't appear to know how to make a martini -- he made us a kamikaze-like concoction instead, which we drank -- but he should have just said he couldn't do martinis so he'd be happy to whip us up something special. The bar itself is tiny and their liquor/mixers appear to be very limited -- they seem to prefer that people order off of the specialty cocktail shortlist -- if you don't have the ingredients for a grey goose dirty martini that's fine, just let us know what the deal is. They also have a limited selection of reasonably priced bottles of wine -- as a table, we ended up enjoying a cotes du rhone. The menu is short but pretty much everything is interesting and tasty. I wouldn't get the pop rocks oysters again -- it's a cool idea, and I give him points for creativity, but I didn't exactly like them -- I guess I don't like sweet with my oysters. The foie gras toasts were delicious, the truffle goat cheese pizza was perfect, and the main courses of cod and lamb were standouts. My god, that lamb! Falling off the bone tender, in a delicious sauce, with sweet potato fries. And get the spicy naan -- not to be missed. The sundae and hazelnut souffle desserts were very nice endings to the meal. Final thought -- they should give every table both the omnivore menu and the vegetarian menu -- we weren't offered the vegetarian menu, and I'm sure we would have ordered some dishes off of it had we seen it.",12,0.9929

1161,10,7,4.0,"I first went to Kuti's a couple months back after reading Deanna W.'s review. I couldn't believe that I got scooped on a place that was practically in my own backyard! Nevertheless, Yelp and let Yelp, as they say, so I swallowed my pride and headed over to check out what all the fanfare was about. West African shwarma didn't make much sense to me beforehand, but 15 minutes and 1 lamb shwarma sandwich later, I had seen the light and it was Good. I've made a couple pilgrimages back and have been similarly rewarded, most recently on a food outing where I was able to try most of the menu. Out of everything I had the lamb and the merguez are the clear winners. The lamb is shaved off a vertically-aligned spit that is constantly rotating, basking the meat with heat and slightly charring its surface as it makes its way around the orbit. It's flavorful and cooked perfectly - juicy and tender but not gamy. The other side of the equation consists of the accompanying ingredients in the sandwich. Take the usual suspects you'd expect to find in shwarma, fold in stewed sweet peas and sauteed green beans that have both been simmered in a heart-warming tomato and onion sauce, sprinkle some ras-el-hanout, a Moroccan spice blend, for added flavor and depth and squirt some mildly scorching hot sauce on top for tear-inducing joy and you've got what's quite possibly the greatest thing since Jean Claude Van Damne Fridays. For even more fun and textural gymnastics you can add fries to your sandwich. Could it get any better!!?But wait, there's more! Of course it can!! I bet you were reading this review, wondering ""Tell me, Mike, how can they possibly fit all of those ingredients in one pita pocket?"" Well, folks, you've been such a great crowd, so I'll let you in on the open secret: instead of using pita, Kuti's wraps your shwarma in what seems to be a flour burrito tortilla, which has two benefits. 1. the sandwich has a higher meat-to-bread ratio than your average pita sandwich 2. the ingredients are almost entirely wrapped up in the tortilla, which means that it's a lot less messy to eat than a packed pita. After assembling the sandwich they put it in a panini press to warm everything up and toast the bread. And it can be yours, all for the super-low price of $6!!!! Call Kuti's now at 212-222-1127 and place your order today!! (The day I found out I was just barely outside the delivery radius was one of the saddest days of my adult life.)Back to our regular programming, the other options - chicken, tongue, etc. - are good, but not at the level of the lamb. The brain - Abby Normal - wasn't too hot - creamy but difficult to eat, owing to it being too slippery and squishy (it reminded me of this Calvin & Hobbes comic - gocomics.com/calvinandho…). After satisfying our zombie tendencies we went back to the chicken, which comes on the bone in a platter that's big enough to satisfy... big people.I also have to give a shout out to the fried sweet plantains, which were everything I hoped for, but the hot sauce really pushed them to go above and beyond - they were delicious. Kuti's is literally a hole in the wall (Scott W.'s text reads ""Place looks like a little shack""); it has maybe enough standing room for four people to order. There are usually a couple seats at the ready outside, but you're better off walking the block to Morningside Park if the weather permits.If you live nearby you have no excuse to have not been here and if you don't I'd strongly suggest going out of your way to try it. The lamb and merguez are easily five star-worthy. Kuti's bills itself as ""a cuisine sans frontieres,"" an ambitious epithet, but one that fits it perfectly.

Feeling less maudlin about living in NYC than I have in a long time, I walked into this precisely appointed laid back space and booked a table for two. My friend was late, so I waited outside on the recently added benches - watching the passers by and enjoying the waning of the day into evening. Once arrived, we both were promptly seated in the large, open, lime-washed exposed brick room. It was both warmly intimate and open and airy - not sure how that oxymoron was achieved in this space, but achieved it was and it worked. As for the food, well, let's just say the way to this girls' heart is not diamonds, but duck fat fries. And maybe the Sweet Pea Summer Pie, which lets you hold onto the summer one mouthful at a time. Round that off with Green Curried Monkfish with wild rice and Sheep's Yogurt Raita - and you have one happy lady on your hands.* Highly recommend it for a dinner for one, two, five, maybe even a wedding reception?** You will not be disappointed.*all of these items were shared between me and my dining companion - the portion sizes are perfect for sharing.

Having it delivered, I was impressed by how quickly it arrived. The packaging was adept too because I was able to assemble the ingredients of the soup and was able to recover most of the flavor. In person it is of course a bit better. I really loved the Pho Xe Lua ($6.50) which is the house special. You get a nice mix of the beef balls, brisket, tendon, and tripe.  The meat is plentiful and actually quite good, very flavorful. The broth was excellent too, aromatic and complex. The noodles separated nicely and all of the add-ins were fresh. I had a great deal of fun working through this rather inexpensive and sizable dish. The service definitely stands out for Chinatown. No dour faces here quick to take your check as you are still signing it. No, no quite the opposite. Everyone is so happy, so quick on their feet, and so attentive.

Ask for the penne pomodoro to be extra spicy and, if you don't like spicy food, bring the dish my way. The eggplant parmigiana is seemingly a local favorite.

It seems like easy jokes goes on the house which such a name/speciality: meatballs. Have you seen the ""Ball Jokes"" section on their web site? themeatballshop.com/inde… . No kidding. But I don't know. You people can think about guys and stuff, but honestly is all about grandma. The homey taste. I think its the first thing will cross everyone's mind ... ok, the second one for some maybe, but it is unquestionable that a comfy feeling comes up on your first bite. The texture. Firm yet juicy. Forget about being sloppy, undercook, overcook or like a stone in texture which I find common mistakes in other's. As for the sauces, those are key. Thick and creamy. Smooth and comforting. Savory and filling. You can find same quality balls in many other places but let me explain. Only in terms of execution and meat quality because the concept here is a brilliant idea and not many probably will offer this meatballs innovation and flavors profile on the sauces. Do one thing and do it the best. Once, I heard Adria explaining how he reach his creations. Simple yet genius. Choose one ingredient, only one, and think about how to change everything on it, under any perspective. Obviously, things are more simple here, there is not deconstruction, but the idea seems to be the same.Therefore I like the approach to the patron offering a customize menu. It seems short at first but if you spin around the balls enough there is not much chances to repeat same meal even for frequent visitors. Take the sharpie and mark on the menu, which meatball, with which sauce and which format: naked (4 balls) on a bun (1) on a baguette (3) or smashed (2) over a brioche. Now, coming back to the traditional? aspect. The size is by the grandma measurement. Those things are enormous and they gave you 4 per order when naked is chosen. Come on. Don't tell me the biggest food coma is not been when family gatherings...right? therefore 2 people can share 2 orders and left satisfied enough. Suffering from gluttony? up to you. 4 per person its a lot. A lot, even under those circumstances. You are warned. At $7 per dish for the naked ones I find it more than reasonable. We choose the spicy pork with pesto sauce and the special with mushroom gravy. Loved the light spicy hint. And the cheese on the sauces. On a side we opted for polenta and the risotto. And once again both were comfy taste, creamy, rich and delicious. On the fail side, our special meatballs I find it occasionally dry and I would have like less sauce over it. Since it was so delightful I was ok with that. There is also a wait, probably always. On a pouring Friday night in this location, 2 people waited 20 min to get a table. It clear up around 11pm. I was ok with that too. And if you catch seats on the bar, you keep them. The decor, using one of my faves quotes, is very Brooklyn. Its like taking the L train and somehow you automatically know is going to Willi. You know what I mean? Somehow it also resembles to me to a 1950's style. Like if the Mad Men crew were hanging here after work. But without the smoke. The wall filled with old machines to ground meat can be a little disturbing at first but look charming after a little bit. This loft industry style is surprisingly well organize and bigger that you think. The lighting made it cozy even being noisy and pack. The individual tables would need to be bigger and not as close each other but I was ok with that even when it made us to drop one of our forks three times. Three. But the service was outstanding. More things to like is that its right at the L train station and its open later serving food until 2 (weekdays) or 4 am (weekends). Maybe its not worth it to wait on the Manhattan location. If you haven't try it yet, you know you have to do it. I remember thinking, come on, this is just meatballs .. what is the whole thing about it? Well, its not just regular meatballs and it tells you how the most simple things can fairly become everyone's crush. And you know what?

You can be sure that you will respect the craft, even while marveling at the ability to churn out consistent quality after all these years - not to mention you will be waiting in line for a long time.Taverna Kyclades (Kycla) towers above the competition much like the six foot six chef towers above mere mortals. But, let's just count the ways:1. Most diners at (the extremely competent) Watawa Sushi across the street are likely there because they couldn't find a seat at Kycla2. Diners would rather wait for half an hour in the cold as opposed to dining at nearby Greek restaurants (more than empty)3. It epitomizes destination dining. Despite the Astoria location, its customer base spans myriad different cultures4. I swallow my pride to come back and wait in line after telling the reception staff not to put my name on the (long) waiting list!!Few restaurants in the city can rival Kycla in terms of value-for-money. A meal for two (with a Carafe of the house wine) should cost less than 60 dollars. And, the quality is consistent across the year(s) - as my two dozen or so visits would testify.No one in New York has better grilled Octopus than Kycla: marinated overnight to ensure melt-in-the mouth texture, the first flavor to hit you is that of the grill, followed immediately by that of lemon, and finally olive oil. This would be the best version in the city, across any cuisine!The other mezes are also delicious: from the creamy Tzatziki (with dill, garlic, and cucumber) which accompanies the wonderful herbed semolina bread (hot off the oven) to the flaky Spanakopita (spinach pie), the pan-fried Saganaki cheese (not fried as deeply as at other restaurants) or the stuffed grape leaves, it's hard to single out even a single miss. The restaurant specializes in fish (they are flying off the wall and off the kitchen!) and so any entrée is guaranteed to be tasteful and fresh. However, I pay more attention to polishing off the unmatched lemony potatoes as opposed to working on the entrees. These soft and tangy lemony potatoes would so enrich your life that you'd wonder how come you'd never included them as a staple in your diet!More likely than not you will be offered complimentary Galaktobourekos (phyllo dough, custard, cinnamon) as dessert and while the phyllo dough crust should be crispier, the custard makes up for its deficiencies to end the meal on a good note. So, believe the hype. If you didn't appreciate the food - it's probably you. But stay clear of Kycla on the weekend - the wait might just transport you into the 'Hereafter'.",26,0.9892

A prawn dish with clam broth and cherry tomatoes called District D9NE ($14). The Fish and some Chips fried branzino ($16) served with a mohawk of roe[2]. The Smoked salmon pate' ($8) served in an ashtray with a bread stick burnt at the end to imitate a cigar.

Unusual murals decorate the walls of the wonderful patio, where recycled picnic tables and discarded chairs are also used.Whether you'll find this playful approach to food enjoyable or annoying is a matter of personal preference.

Also, the tako tacos ($6; octopus tacos) come to mind; together with the wonderful Shishito peppers quatre sel ($7; served with four salts: green tea, wasabi, seaweed, and yuzu).If I had to pick a signature dish, it would be the foie grad doughnut, aka Dough[3] or Dine ($11). A doughnut complete with sugar dusting and raspberry or apricot jelly, filled with wonderfully decadent, yet surprisingly light, foie gras.Not everything on the menu is a winner: the nippon nachos didn't do it for me, just like the pork and wasabi shumai ($8).

As an aspiring Betty Draper in training, I turn to few smokes for comfort after. Le sigh. This family owned German meat purveyor has been selling sausages, ham and other smoked goods out of their small UES shop for years. Most everything is made out of their factory in Astoria. From the best of the wursts, silky spreadable pates, smokey loins and bellies, there lies a veritable treasure for meat eaters inside those majestic glass cases. The butchers attend to your whims and needs politely and samples are handed out if you so wish.I like to get a few links of smoked weiners and bratwurst and maybe some weisswurst or spicy bauernwurst if I'm feeling adventurous. Their franks and weiners are flavorful and have a great snap to them. The cooked bratwurst are plump and juicy and require a quick boil and a few minutes on the grill or pan. Moreover, they brown and crisp up nicely, faster than Ron Jeremy hitting the payload. If you've been to Lugers or one of their many knockoffs then you know about the wonders of their famed, heart attack inducing Canadian bacon. Well, I'm pleased to report that you can replicate that experience here with a purchase of their famous double smoked bacon. Get it thickly sliced, broil at home and you'll quickly find yourself in a hog nirvana. Though your cardiologist may not approve.Finally, there's a good selection of side dishes, breads and imported German candies to round out your shopping excursion. I'm not so crazy about some of their cooked items but I can vouch that their in-house sauerkraut is as fabulous as sauerkraut can be. It's fresh, has good texture and a little tanginess-the perfect compliment to your stuffed meat. And don't forget the mustard, I counted at least ten different varieties on my last visit but their house version cuts it just fine.So yes, get stuffed here. Just don't cry if it's at the expense of one of your prized dishes. At least your meat eating, teutonic culinary inclined eaters will thank you.",34,0.9912

I gathered a big group of friends and terrified that we'd have to wait over an hr for such a large group, I called them the day before. Unfortunately they do not take reservations, but the host on the other line was very helpful. She asked me to call half an hr before they open their doors at 6, and they'll setup a large table if I could make it there upon opening time. Sure it was an early dinner but it's better than waiting. Since there were 7 of us, we decided to just order one of everything off the menu. I think we shocked the waiter by saying, we'd take one of everything. Everything except healthy stuff, no salads! After all why would we go to a place called Salt & Fat for healthy salad. Some of the plates were so small that they're really not for sharing, but we were on a mission to taste EVERYTHING.We had to reorder a few smaller items such as; the Korean BBQ wraps - they're hors d'œuvre size. Tasty little wraps on bibb lettuce that take 2 bites to finish. We also reordered the Fried Chicken cuz it was so finger lickin good! I'd go back just for the Fried Chicken. The seasoning on it was awesome, I tasted fresh thyme and it was perfectly crispy on the outside (we were fighting for the chicken skin), and juicy & moist on the inside. The herb ranch sauce is like crack sauce. Once we had a taste of that, we put it on everything. The chicken is half a small chicken with white meat & dark meat. Even the white meat was flavorful, tender, and juicy. I haven't had a fried chicken like this in ages.  Some of my favorite dishes were the scallops, crack & cheese, Korean BBQ wraps, and the steak frites were good too. Everything else was good but not amazing.The desserts were amazing though. We were amazed by the jalepeno, marshmallow, and yuzu lemon sorbet. The lychee panna cotta was heavenly.Service was attentive and on point, and all the dishes were beautifully presented until we massacred them. The decor is welcoming and romantic. Although I could see a small bar being put it for people who are waiting for a table/guests.",21,0.9974
1173,18,10,4.0,"Lodged in a quiet street on W 10th, Alta is deceptively small. When the passage opens into the restaurant space, I always wish to be (and luckily am) seated on the top floor. Alta's ambience whispers romance like none other (barring the one time our drunk and noisy neighbours drowned that whisper thoroughly with their raucous yelling), but I would definitely recommend it for bigger groups as well.I think it would be fair to say that almost every small plate at Alta is out to seduce your taste buds. Every dish has something to spruce it up - be it a play of acid/sweetness/crunch or the use of truffle emulsions or an interesting flavoured foam quivering atop the dish. The Philadelphia truffle surprise is sinful, and I end up ordering a couple of plates to share, though I am not usually a fan of the fried stuff. They also have an excellent baked sunchoke dish with what appears to be a tamarind caviar lacing the garnish. Also worth a mention are the warm vegetable salad and the brussel sprouts dish.They have plenty vegetarian options on their menu, and they'd be happy to bring you a separate vegetarian/dairy-free menu if you ask.Their cocktail list is above average, but I think the highlight of beverage list is the expansive wine selection. Wouldn't I love it if they had more wines by the glass. The last time I was there, we were celebrating something special and so the 'ezband went ahead and ordered an excellent barolo (which we paid an arm, a leg and a liver for). And, while I usually never finish a meal without dessert, I think the sweetmeats here are not the highlight of the restaurant.Service is the biggest reason there's a star missing for Alta. When running a wine bar it is utterly important for the server to be knowledgable about every dish and wine on the menu, or at least have a sommelier who can jump to the rescue when the occasion demands it. At Alta, I see none of this. Most of the waiters run about their duty busily and uncuriously, until you track them down to take your order or to refill your glass. And when they fix that, the 5 stars will be theirs to keep.",19,0.9941

No skimping on the toppings either, if you want a slice of pepperoni you're getting 5% of the pig.There's no salad, there's no beer, there's no pasta, there's no credit cards.

Unfortunately we got stuck in the most unattractive room in the place. Old photos and vintage beer cans adorned the room, but it didn't substitute for the charm that it was lacking. The old wooden wrap around bar and beautiful wood doors and molding of the main room was where we should have been. No worries though, we had a great time. Oh, did I mention the beer? We had pitchers of a lighter beer, which then led to a darker one. Helpful, eh? Well, I don't know beers. I just know I don't like em, but this went down eaaaaasy :) Now as for the food, I started with a spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. Although the spinach was fresh and plentiful, it wasn't what I was expecting (It was large leafed and chewy) and I didn't care for the dressing which was kind of bacon-jelly like.

Innovative drinks, due to a combination of creativity and fresh ingredients, has revolutionized bubble tea, at least in Flushing. For all I know, this probably happened in Taiwan 19 years ago. Oh wait, it did...Share Tea has been established since 1992! One Hurricane Irene day, when I housed refugees Daniel B. and Calvin C., we decided to make a trek to Flushing because, as the old (my) axiom proved to be true, Chinese stores are open in any weather. We wanted some bubble tea but Kung Fu Tea was unfortunately closed. Feeling hopeless (and wet, as it was raining sideways), we turned around only to see Share Tea flash at us like the light at the end of the tunnel. And better yet was the free promotional upgrade to a large with any medium sized purchase.I ended up with the mango green tea with cream. The cashier said the cream was fresh made and assured me it wasn't like whipped cream, which I hate. She also taught me how to cut open the cup in order to drink the cream and green tea at the same time, since they didn't mix. The cream still packed a caloric punch, but it tasted rather light and delightfully fresh. I wouldn't get it again, unless I wanted to intentionally gain weight, but a sip of my buddies' taro and milk teas assured me this was a quality place.Also, this was one of the more interesting cashiers, as Linny F. said. She is bilingual, fluent in English and Chinese. She was also incredibly knowledgeable about the drinks and competent. And, of course, she was a cutie.So story time. My friend, Calvin C., is 100% Cantonese. He faked passing Mandarin Chinese in college by speaking Cantonese either very quickly or very slowly, whichever resulted in the better Mandarin accent.

I guess in my time of doing this, I had neglected a place. A place that was in the middle of an alley, and which was oddly busy for a dim-sum place being that it was 7pm in the evening. Having a set menu was a great way to be introduced to this old-school spot, as it forced me to try a few new items, even though it meant I would miss out on a few standards of my ordering. Phil showed up with bottles of wine, and if there's any better way to make a lush happy, I don't know about it. Going back to the old-school nature of things, nothing says old-school better than red-checkered-cloth table tops, and coat and hat racks that look like they were scavenged from a vintage shop. Fact is, the closing of places like Nom Wah are what allows those kinds of things to make their way into vintage shops, being that the place hasn't changed a bit since the 1920s. Not that I know this for a fact, as I wasn't around then, but that's what I'm told.So, how was the food? In a word, great. Really great. There were some things that were a little subpar compared to others I've had elsewhere, and one that I just didn't really like, but overall this would be a great spot to take somebody for a late night craving.Oh, and I don't usually give out a tip like this, but...When you leave, head right out the door and two doors down there's a shop with a sign that says ""Gold Flower Restaurant"".

At most I'd occasionally peer into its windows, starving-Victorian-orphan style, only in this case I'd quickly decide I was most likely better off outside in the cold and maybe eating a dead pigeon instead. However, now that Taro has abandoned its intimidatingly shitholey old space for swanky new digs that are clean and warm and inviting, I finally felt okay going to try it, and dear god just typing that sentence makes me feel decidedly middle-aged and stroller-wielding.Anyway, despite being the guy who only liked your favorite indie band after they did a song for a car commercial, I'm happy to report that the sushi here is as good as other Yelpers say. The sushi was among the freshest I've had, easily on par with my other Brooklyn favorites, Kiku and Yamato. My girlfriend's salmon and avocado rolls were excellent, tasting quite like butter-in-fish-form and butter-in-fruit-form wrapped up in rice and seaweed, exactly as they should. Even our fried shrimp shumai appetizer tasted at least like particularly high-quality pre-manufactured goods.Really the only complaint I had was that the soy sauce here seemed unusually salty; a quick dab in the dipping bowl here translates to a half-submerged soak anywhere else. I also noticed that the lunch specials run a few bucks more than the $8-10 that's practically standard at other sushi joints. However, given that the last time I ordered my trusted sushi lunch special from Kiku, they only gave me three pieces accompanied by a suspiciously mountainous/subtly apologetic pile of California rolls, maybe I oughta try spending a few bucks extra after all.",10,0.9683

Most of the super negative reviews are just a bunch of Haters. There is a ton to like here. Don't dock a restaurant 2 stars because you made a reservation a month out and expected the moon. Just head up right after work and sit in the bar area, on any day of the week. It's actually pretty damn easy. Let's go over the Pros and Cons...DRINKS:Pros - For me, this place serves the some of the best drinks in Harlem right now, even if the bar is a bit limited. Granted that's not saying much as there is very little competition. Please do not mention 67 Orange (holy crap that place is WAY overrated). Red Rooster focuses mostly on their infused Bourbon's and has some great originals. Personally, The Dillio is the best thing on the menu (Peanut Infused Bourbon, Canton Ginger, Lime and Muddled Dill). Close runner ups include the Brownstoner (Nutmeg Bourbon, Cherry Herring and St. Germaine) and Big Red Rooster (Cinnamon Bourbon, Dolin Rouge, Averna and Orange Bitters). The Peanut Bourbon is amazing though, and I had a Peanut Bourbon Old Fashioned made off menu that was just awesome.Cons - It's a restaurant bar, and as such the variety of bottles is somewhat limited. Earl of Harlem Cocktail looks like it's stirred but it's a shaken drink with Lemon that is not mentioned on the menu. Drinks are downtown pricey but not quite at the level of a good downtown cocktail bar.FOOD:Pros - Food tastes pretty bangin! First of all, the Fried Chicken Caesar is a total revelation with Smoked Vinaigrette and a Runny Egg on top. Also love the Fried Yard Bird. Good Fried Chicken with an almost candied crust. The Mac & Cheese is delicious. The cornbread is unbelievable. The Meatballs are very tasty as well, and I love the lingonberries that come with it. Best of all is probably the Whiskey Fudge for dessert, which is intensely packed with flavor and topped with Macadamia Nuts. We also enjoyed the Coffee & Donuts. Overall, not one miss on taste.Cons - Yes, it's pricey for the portion sizes. The Meatballs (you only get 6) and Cornbread (2 pieces) are probably the biggest offenders here. Definitely coming back when I hit the neighborhood. If nothing else, I would come here repeatedly for that Caesar, Peanut Bourbon, Mac & Cheese, Cornbread and Whiskey Fudge.",30,0.9963

Only because I just don't think the whole world is aware of such a jewel near Time's Square that is NOT overpriced or touristy or downright tacky.... BUT, I made a commitment as a Yelper to spread the word on all restaurants deserving of my praise. So here goes: I freaking love you Dafni. Does that make me a lesbian? No, not yet, but if I continue eating your delectable Greek fare I think I might have to change teams. In all seriousness though, Dafni has become my favorite Greek restaurant so far in the city. Why, you make ask? Here's why!#1. They bring you hot and toasty complimentary pita bread triangles to start with accompanied by tasty olive oil and vinegar. Just pace yourself accordingly or you might just eat the entire basket before your meal arrives then you are f*cked (and not in a fun way)!#2. The Melitzanosalata appetizer is to DIE for. Melitzanosalata is a baby eggplant spread made with garlic and olive oil. It was freakishly delicious, garlicky, full of eggplant and I ate up every last bit of it with all the hot pita bread I could. I had to duke it out with my boyfriend over the last specks on the plate.#3. Calling all large and yummy entrees! I had the lamb kebab and the boy had the chicken slouvaki. Such huge portions and tasty! Both came with delicious tsziki sauce, zesty cucumber salad and we opted for the rosemary mashed potatoes! So good. And because there was just so much food, I actually saved half for lunch the next day. Yaye for spreading out meals and saving even more money.#4. Service! Great service as well. The waiters are nice but not too chatty. The restaurant itself is simple- tasteful and casual. #5. Price! You usually don't see quality and quantity go hand in hand in the vicinity of Time's Square for such a good price! Dafni offers very affordable plates and you get a lot of fare for the money. Always a plus.So what it comes down to is... Dafni is definitely my new favorite restaurant near Time's Square plus my new favorite Greek restaurant in NYC. Whenever I go to see a movie in TS I check to see about dinner at Dafni afterward. Trust me go after the movie otherwise you might have to bring your leftovers into the theater which we did last time.... people started looking at us funny because we smelled so good.",22,0.9973
1183,27,14,4.0,"ATTENTION! ATTENTION! Can I get your attention, please? Authentic Cajun food has landed in Astoria! That's right. We Astorians now have our very own Cajun restaurant. But I can't take credit for this discovery. That belongs to the Princess of Astoria, Elle P., who I can always count on to inform me on the comings and goings of our neighborhood. When Elle first told me about Sugar Freak, I admit that was skeptical. What kind of Cajun restaurant is called Sugar Freak anyway? During dinner I had my question answered when we had a chance to chat with the owner, Michelle, who explained that Sugar Freak was originally supposed to be a bakery. But when she realized that Astoria was lacking in the Cajun/Creole department, a demand she was qualified to supply because her family is from New Orleans, she decided to redirect her shop's focus from desserts to Cajun and teamed up with a chef from New Orleans. At that point she'd already fallen in love with the license plate Sugar Freak logo that she commissioned an Etsy artist to make for her and couldn't bear to give that up. yelp.com/biz_photos/kSI-… Thus, Sugar Freak the Cajun/Creole restaurant was born. When we were there over the weekend, the restaurant was having a Heatwave Special inspired by the recent killer heat - $8 for their regularly $11 specialty cocktails. I went for the Ramos Fiz, while my dining companions had the Lynchburg Lemonade and Watermelon Punch. My drink was SO good: strong but well-mixed and really tasty, frothy, and refreshing. I'd go back to Sugar Freak for the drinks alone. As we were deciding on what to order, Holly (our server who was really friendly and attentive) brought us a tray of peanuts. Like a true fatty, I mindlessly reached for the peanuts set in front of me. It wasn't until I popped a peanut in my mouth that I realized they weren't regular peanuts. They're spiced! Nice touch, Sugar Freak.Our group of three decided to eat family style. We started with the CRAWFISH BOUDIN BALLS. yelp.com/biz_photos/kSI-… For those unfamiliar, boudin balls are basically fried risotto balls. Sugar Freak's take was awesome: piping hot, perfectly crispy exterior, and flavorful interior with plenty of crawfish. This was my favorite thing from dinner at Sugar Freak, and a must order! One order is three boudin balls, so if you have more than three in your group, I'd suggest getting more than one order. You won't want to share.We also shared the JAMBALAYA yelp.com/biz_photos/kSI-… and the SHRIMP AND CRAB BOIL yelp.com/biz_photos/kSI-… with sides of MAC AND CHEESE yelp.com/biz_photos/kSI-… and COLLARD GREENS. The jambalaya was really good, fluffy rice with a generous helping of chicken, shrimp and sausage. However, I'd pass on the shrimp and crab boil next time. The shrimp was overcooked and the crabs were tiny and not worth the work it took to get to the meat. The collard greens also weren't anything special, but I really enjoyed the mac and cheese. Though the macaroni noodles weren't smothered in cheese, the cheese was sharp and packed a punch. The dusting of baked breadcrumbs on top provided the perfect finishing touches. For dessert we split the BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING. yelp.com/biz_photos/kSI-… The dessert took so long to come out that I joked that they were making it for us fresh. Turns out that indeed, they did make the dessert to order, and it was worth the wait. The bread pudding was luscious and warm, and the accompanying butter glaze paired wonderfully. I took more than the obligatory taste bite of one who lacks a sweet tooth. As a designer, I love cohesive and well-thought out design. Sugar Freak was just that. I couldn't help gushing over the adorable interior of the restaurant all through dinner. Everything about their look, from the hand-painted chandeliers to the patchwork pillows and curtains, from the mixed-media menus to the kitschy mismatched china, all contributed to Sugar Freak's quirky, homey feel. We found out that Michelle is responsible for most of the interior design and she was very big on recycled materials. I love that the wooden booths, wood in the bathroom, and tin paneling on the ceiling were all appropriated from an old barn. Don't let the name fool you. Sugar Freak is home to authentic Cajun/Creole and great drinks as well as rich desserts. I know I'll be back. In fact, I've already made plans to introduce some fellow Astorians to our new neighborhood gem next week.",28,0.998

My Lebanese friends would say the food is traditional Lebanese. My Greek friends will say that the menu features many dishes their grandmother would make. And my Turkish friends would vehemently disagree, saying that the Greeks steal everything from the Turks. In order to appease everyone, let's agree that the food is traditional Mediterranean?Because we were in the mood to share and to try many different items from the menu, we ordered the Mezze Royale. This particular spread includes 5 cold mezze and 5 hot mezze. Our waiter suggested ordering an entree in addition to the Mezze Royale in order to make sure we were satiated. Umm, okay. Granted we were the heaviest folks in the restaurant, we were definitely full after the round of cold mezze.From the selection of cold mezze, my favorites were the Baba Gahannouj (it was much spicier than the simple hommus also served) and the Tabbouleh (the combination of mint and parsley was delightful). The grape leaves were also executed perfectly and did not disappoint.We were granted a few minutes to allow our stomachs to meditate on the wonderful first round and out came the hot mezze. After cracking a joke about whether the recipe for Phoenician fries was written in cuneiform (yeah, I descend from a long line of nerds), we dug in. In addition to the perfectly spiced Phoenician fries, I also loved the mekanek (delightfully spiced lamb sausage) and falafel. I didn't think it could get better than my East Village student staple falafel, but it does. The perfectly crisp exterior, the delicious yogurt-tahini sauce - both make a world of difference.For dessert we shared apricot Lebanese ice cream and baklava. The ice cream was much creamier than expected, but the apricot flavor is very pronounced. It triggered memories of travels where we would gorge ourself on apricots and dates. Two varieties of baklava were brought out - pistachio and cashew. Both were much lighter on honey and had more delicate pastry than the typical baklava. It's always surprising that when ""simple"" dishes are prepared well and thoughtfully, they can go from ""good"" to ""outstanding."" This was exactly the case at ilili.",20,0.9935
1189,13,17,4.0,"SUSHI OVERLOAD!!!I'm a HUGE fan of sushi. Basically anything raw like oysters, tuna and scallops. If it used to be alive and it's not cooked... I'll most likely be eating it. After watching a movie a friend of mine ended up near K-Town and sushi sounded really good. I've never been here so I was excited to try it out. The place is big and spacious and the variety of food seems to be endless.They have a HUGE assortment of rolls, sashimi and tartares. I'm the type of guy that only gets sushi and stays away from all the rice and noodles. You can have noodles any day, but great sushi isn't something you get everyday. I made a few trips to the sushi area and then made my way down to the hot bar where the meats and fried things are. I picked up a few things here and there, but I was still in ""sushi mode"". All in all the food was really good and I got my sushi fix. For dessert they have 3 types of ice cream. Green Tea, Mango and Red Bean. If you see my pic. I ended up getting the Green Tea and adding pieces of Green Tea cakes on top... REALLY GOOD!Things you will always see at this place:-The guy who has two plates and always asks for something that's NOT on the menu.-The Chinese guy who takes ALL the crab legs EVERYTIME you go and get some.-The Family of tourists.-The lady who takes a lot of food and doesn't even finish anything.

It's the underground spot frequented by Chinese and Filipino locals deep in the heart of NYC Chinatown and, as it gained popularity, by celebrities and food television personalities like Anthony Bourdain.The restaurant itself is not much to look at. The floors are greasy, the smell is a medley of fried food, raw seafood, and lysol, and the florescent lights are pretty obnoxious. But the food, goodness gracious, is downright impressive. I agree with Ken G. on this one. Most of the items we ordered were well-seasoned, well-cooked, and authentic. I'm normally not into saucy and overly savory dishes, Hop Kee's dishes work. Fried items came out hot and crispy, sauced items were neither too creamy nor too salty. Though the prices are on the higher side (cash only), they give you an enormous portion. The won ton soup was particularly impressive. Not the kind of soup I typically see. This one is loaded with chunky slices of bbq pork, chicken, duck, shrimp, bok choy, straw mushrooms, bamboo shoots and, of course, giant wontons...more like 20% soup and 80% meat and stuffing. Though the flavor was slightly bland for my liking, it was still soothing, warm, and refreshing. This soup is definitely heavy (because it's ""won ton""...get it? womp, womp...corny, I know...).I also enjoyed the spicy beef with chili peppers...super tender beef. But, honestly, I became fixated on the Cantonese style snails. The sauce was wonderful and fun to eat. I'm stopping short of five stars because some of the dishes fell short, like the salted pepper squid (not tender enough) and the Walnut Prawns (too creamy). Overall though, I enjoyed my meal at Hop Kee and will definitely be back.",22,0.9957
1191,18,15,4.0,"A dinner out with the family was long overdue, so we all decided to head over to ""downtown"" Flushing and check this place out. I've walked by here so many times...always peeking in and feeling intimidated by the lack of English signage and non-Chinese patrons. Of course my feelings intimidation were baseless since a) the menu is in English and b) it's usually a good thing when, well, Chinese people patronize a Chinese restaurant.* We got a table pretty painlessly, despite every seat being full when we arrived - good sign. Not so good a sign that we had to wait 20 mins for the appearance of our first dish, especially since diners seated after us were getting their meals. My grumbling tummy was in concert with my general grumbling to the family. But, as cliche as this sounds, the food was worth the wait. We shared the Spicy Squid Legs, Spicy Lamb, Garlic Eggplant, Lamb and Carrot Dumplings and a chicken dish that was all dried red chili peppers**, fried ginger and scallions with small morsels of fried chopped chicken wings. The waiter tried to convince us to go with all white meat on the latter dish - when confronted with our confused looks, he proposed a compromise of half white meat and half chicken wings. In the end a good call because while I like to crunch on bones as much as the next person (what? no bone crunching for you?!), respite in the form of chicken breast is a good thing. All dishes were so amazingly good - the squid legs with the schezuan peppercorns and thinly sliced celery, and the garlicky eggplant were my favorites. In fact, that eggplant was the best eggplant with garlic sauce I've ever had anywhere (so far) - it was sweet, savory; there was a wonderful caramelized texture on the eggplant that was oh so delicious. We cleaned our plates and left feeling full and content and really happy that we decided to come here. Confirmation for myself that Chinese cuisine is still my favorite. I'm a fan!*same goes for other ethnicity's... it's a sign that good food is being made at the restaurant. **do not attempt to eat the dried red chili peppers if you aren't a fan of heat.

1192,19,8,4.0,"They serve up a delicious lobster well worth the trip to Red Hook to seek out. A mere $15 will land you an authentic roll, a bag of Cape Cod potato chips, and a delicious pickle. The roll itself is a hot dog bun fully toasted on the outside (presumably with the addition of butter) and sliced deeply along the top. The slit holds tasty, massive chunks of lobster meat largely intact. The meat is minimally dressed with a scant use of mayonnaise and, I think, a hit of paprika. Celery shavings top this wonderful creation so as to provide a nice contrast of texture. For a little extra, you can wash everything down with Maine Root Soda -- a must. The place itself is separated into two distinct parts. In the main section, you place your order. The space is cramped and it is clearly set up for takeout orders. Fortunately, you can have your meal next door in the other section. There you will find several picnic tables in a nautical themed room. It's very kickback, relaxed, with no hint of pretense. Just a simple place to enjoy your summer food on a nice summer day. Overall, their lobster roll is the real thing, just like you would find in the lobster shacks along the Maine coast. The only place in the city with a roll of comparable quality is Luke's. I really rate them equally. They are both fantastic.4.5 stars",18,0.9883

1194,28,15,4.0,"It's said that ginger and cinnamon are aphrodisiacs. Well, I don't know what it is but I knew I had to drink it just by breathing the intense aroma of cinnamon floating in the air. A fantastic mix with Tamarindo, reposado, pineapple, ginger liquor, d'aristi xtabentun (Maya liquor made of rum, fermented honey, and anise) finished with cinnamon and salt rim. Who would knew the night at Macondo would start with such a drink. My friend's mojito was very good too and we fully enjoyed it waiting at the bar for long time until the rest of our group arrived. A group of 20 when I first book the table, 10 the day before and that ended up being 13. Crazy. Inconsistent and late. Would you like us after this? they did. Apparently a lot. The service at Macondo was much better than expected. And I always expect good service at least. Go figure. Was it aphrodisiac as well? perhaps. With such variety of races, plenty to choose and good looking ... if it is, it goes on you. Choosing Macondo as destination is more about the whole experience than a breathtaking meal. The decoration is exotic, like a tropical forest with a Meatpacking district touch, mostly in the back area. That color changing ceiling that we requested to be purple gave such a character to our dinner. The food is meant to be shared and it focus on street food from all over Latin-America. But having chef Maximo Tejada behind, the guy born in Spain that claims his free style Latino cuisine in Macondo's sister restaurant, Rayuela, it can't be nothing ordinary at all. And in fact Tejada's style reminds me to Richard Sandoval, the guy behind Zengo, La Biblioteca and Maya, although while Sandoval's tendencies go to Asia, Tejada keep his fusion in Latino and Spanish. Our main entrees were my least favorites. Although I liked the special of the day, halibut with polenta, the Pollo Gallego (roasted breast of chicken Galician style) was good enough but nothing memorable as you can tell for my lack of words. The Mofongo (mashed green plantain) De Pulpo (octopus) failed for me in both, flavor and execution, mostly in the last one as the pulpo was though, even difficult to eat. And the Asopao Santiago, a soupy version of paella as themselves described to us, wasn't something that I enjoyed much, mostly because it was too soupy and not in broth but in a sauce instead. But there was very good things. Like the pork belly. That unfortunately, I didn't have the chance to try, not even a small bite ... people . But you should order it. I enjoyed very much the Patatas Bravas, thick round slices of baked and fried potatoes with spicy chili mayo sauce. Being one of the most common tapas in Spain, Macondo's version is different because of the type of potatoes and the cut, and also the spice, spicy paprika for us while chili at Macondo. It was very good and satisfying for only $6. Another good dish was the camaron (shrimp) ceviche, with pineapple chunks and onion, cilantro and apparently there was ginger in the sauce which I didn't really notice. Having tried the ceviche at Desnuda and La Rayuela, Macondo's was nothing extraordinary and I would have like a bit more flavorful, mostly on the tangy side. But still, it was good, the shrimp were crunchy chunks of camaron for real, not those baby shrimps that can easily melt in a marinade like this. More suggestions, A La Lolita or mushroom croquettes with figs and almonds. I really liked everything about this dish. The crispiness of the fried balls, the sweetness on the sauce and the nuttiness of the flavorful Marcona almonds. I would also order again the Lasagna Escalivada, compose by roasted peppers, tomatoes, onions, eggplant, cabra (goat) cheese and garbanzo (chickpeas) puree. Another incursion of Spain as escalivada is a popular dish over there, although not in a lasagna format, neither mixed with cabra cheese that I found to be a wonderful idea. Don't expect a version of moussaka because is nothing to do with that but more like a salad instead. One last thing .. we also drank sangria, not the best I have had but not bad either, and paid only $25 per person. Besides the obvious meaning, cinnamon, ginger and all the others that you may have heard about to lust you (more ideas anyone? .. I kid) can be simply and innocently? a ""thing that cause excitement"" and that is what Macondo could do with you. It happened to us. Nothing was breathtaking by his own but all all the elements acting together... had such an effect.",26,0.999

The Massaman braised goat with purple yams and mustard greens was deliciously fatty, flavorful, fall off the bone - it was the favorite of the night. Other dishes passed the test: - A perfectly prepared roasted duck breast. Accompanied by the additively buttery roti, I could not stop eating this dish. The fresh herbs and green mango fulfilled the fruit/vegetable quota - hi mom! - The crispy oyster ""salad"" served with a garnish of celery in a minty chili-lime vinaigrette was absolutely delicious. The accompanying pork belly was criminally dry. Skip it:- Three diver sea scallops with snap peas, coconut, pea greens - A la carte shrimp skewers. Overly salt/spiced to numbness The first (and last) time I had 'reinterpreted Asian,' the kimchee was presented in a MoMA-worthy lacquer box, the cabbage leaves daintily weaved into a basket and bow tied with a thread of scallion, steamed and ice bathed into a neon green.

It's a mature and low-key wine bistro on a classy stretch of UWS costing, as my erstwhile companion correctly noted ""about $8 too much to make into a regular spot"". I suggest BB for their eroticaesque charcuterie menu only. It favors terrines: $10-$15 buys fascination-concepts like head cheese, Berkshire pork, and truffle-and-port-drizzled foie gras. Entrees were relatively medium-grade bistro staples running closer to $30 than $20. We finished with an ostentatious showpiece dessert-for-two ($25) that incorporated about four sweet varietals too many, and whose style (if not its substance) eclipsed the unmemorable mains. Take a break to explore the wine cellar dowstairs - it's beautiful, and it feels like a secret.

1198,8,8,4.0,"Rarely have I encountered such a case when the gustatory component of an upscale dining experience was so unbalanced with the quality of service provided. Before you read on, I want to clarify. I definitely recommend Bouley! Let yourself become enveloped by the warmth and grandeur of the restaurant, with its floral curtains and indoor white pillars. My mother and I had the lunch tasting menu. If I were to describe the day's meal, I would say that it was a compilation of simple and yet sophisticated tastes and flavors that were both comforting and creative at the same time.The breads to start, the apple raisin mini loaf, herbed baguette, pistacchio rye, olive sourdough, and walnut rye were fun to taste.The bib salad, upon first inspection, seemed boring - a pretty arrangement of clean leaves, but beneath the greenery was heart of palm thinly sliced and paired with trumpet mushrooms that were tossed in a refreshing dressing. My tongue could not dissect the intricate flavors of the sauce, but truly, it was perfect for the marrying of crisp heart of palm and tender mushrooms.The porcini flan, OH the porcini flan!! If I hadn't known any better I would've thought this to be a Chinese crab soup complete with the corn starched broth. Hints of butter tickle your fancy, and you're brought back to the French essence of the dish. My mom, after her first spoonful, covered her mouth and said to me ""can we come back again?!""The duck came with a most brilliant sauce, a trick of both the sweet and savory - honey and porcini puree.Even the palate clearing selection was excellent - perhaps even more notable than the actual dessert dish - a yogurt gelato, whose tartness so wonderfully contrasted with the slightly sweet and crunchy pineapple granite, all atop a smooth coconut soup.Bouley serves spectacular food - 5 stars!! But the service leaves much to be desired. Inconsistency was the theme of the day. Some servers were incredibly polite, thoughtful, and accommodating (from folding your napkin to pulling out your chair for you to directing you to the restroom), while others were not so attentive and even a bit cold. Our neighbors at a nearby table were given full descriptions of the ingredients of each dish when dishes were brought to their table, while our servers only did so for the amuse bouche and otherwise somewhat carelessly dropped off our other food and left. Lastly I'll note that the dishes came out a bit too fast, so I did feel like I was getting rushed to finish my lunch. At a fine dining restaurant such as Bouley, that's definitely not something a patron should experience.I sincerely hope that servers and managers alike read this review. Every restaurant could benefit from some constructive criticism, and I do hope that upon my return the service at Bouley will be just as wonderful as the food served.

Old Brick Café is a restaurant that specializes in tasty meat links among other Balkan* delights. It's also an apparent fraternal hangout for the Balkan men in the neighborhood. I didn't realize that when my friend and I crashed their den of dudedom for lunch. It might explain why the server seemed shocked to see us. He and his barrel-chested buddies in track suits were engrossed in the soccer match on the mounted flatscreen TV, till we walked in. His face seemed to say, ""Are you girls lost?""I'm glad that didn't scare us off because the food here is truly delicious, in that soul satisfying way that transcends cultural familiarity and nostalgic ties. Despite the aforementioned TV and wary glare from the server, the place is actually inviting. Decked out in dark wood and Balkan knick-knacks, it feels homey and authentic. The menu is a mish-mash of globalized guy food (fries, mozzarella sticks, wings) and Balkan classics. I decided on the pasulj ($10). It's a huge bowl of creamy white beans simmered with about a dozen big chunks of insanely smoky beef. The meat was streaked with thick layers of fat like bacon. I decided they weren't worth eating after they'd given up all their flavor to the luscious broth like spent 9-volt batteries.My friend played Russian roulette with the menu and landed on the Sudzuk & Cevapi combo ($10). With no translation provided, we were pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be two kinds of grilled sausage. The sudzuk was two fat links spiced, hard and dry-aged while the cevapi was five pieces of juicy free-form sausage that looked like the brown 'n' serve breakfast variety. A block of fresh cheese, sour cream and chopped onions rounded out the platter. As good as our entrees were, the highlight was the basket of warm pita that came with our meal. The thick, doughy pockets were grilled crisp on the outside and chewy, soft in the middle. We were stuffed but still devoured every last one.However, a quibble: I wasn't impressed with the spinach burek (two slices of spinach pie, $5). The phyllo pastry arrived limp and rubbery--as if it had been microwaved. Aside from that misstep, everything else was great, including the Turkish coffee that my friend got in a beautiful copper service set. Even our server had warmed up to us by the meal's end. I'd definitely go back for the irresistible pita and pasulj or maybe try one of their Balkan salads with feta.If you decide to visit, go armed with a big appetite, tolerance for lots of sausage around you, and greenbacks.

1201,34,18,4.0,"Deanna W and I have been trying to get to Shopshin's for a few months now. Between her schedule conflicting with mine and the fact that Shopshin's have a very limited and weird opening hours, it was hard to find time to go to this place. The restaurant is open only 5 days a week. Sunday and Monday they are closed. When they are opened, they close crazy freakin early. 3 PM everyday except Saturday, in which they close even earlier at 2:30 PM. A few days ago, the stars, the moon, my lucky rabbit's foot and both our schedules finally aligned together perfectly and off we went to Shopshin's.I have read about how mean the owners could get if you didn't follow their rules and if they didn't like you, there was a very good possibility that they would refuse to serve you. Anticipating that, I have studied up on some of the things I am not supposed to do. Don't take photos. Check. No using cell phones. Check. Make sure I had an idea of what to order from their menu ( jammed to the max with a crazy amount choices in tiny tiny small fonts  shopsins.com/wp-content/… ) before you get there. Check. No party bigger than 4. Check. Arriving at Shopshin's, we were initially thrown off by the fact that there was no diners and the chairs were upside down on top of the tables. Crap.  Were they closed early? It was only 1 :30 PM. A moment later, we saw the stickers that was stuck on the underside of the chairs. I don't remember the exact words but it was something like ""Don't touch the chairs unless we say you could be seated."" Nice.  Even their chairs have attitudes. We quickly waved down one of the people working there and were given permission to sit down. With a short discussion of what to order, we ended up getting the smashburgers and the mac'n cheese pancake.The smashburgers is basically 3 small sliders on a roll with melted cheddar cheese and grilled onions.  The meat was incredibly soft and it was overflowing with onion goodness. The whole burger feels like it was going to melt into your mouth and taste buds. It comes with a side of greens and slices of pickles to add as you please.Two of the most mentioned plates here are the mac'n cheese pancake and the slutty pancake. I chose the mac'n cheese because it seemed more savory based on the description. Along with 6 pancakes, they gave us a brand new unopened personal bottle of maple syrup with just enough syrup for the meal.  Unexpectedly they also gave us a large squeeze bottle full of hot sauce. I know what you are thinking. Oh no, there goes Wing with his hot spicy stuff again. I swear I didn't know that it came with this before ordering.  The hot sauce, which is indeed spicy, gives the pancake a nice kick to the taste buds but the maple syrup's sweetness neutralizes the heat enough to make it more than bearable to the palate. Pancakes and hot sauce are a strange combo. Sweet and spicy, who would have thought it'll work so well together? The pancake was really soft and fluffy with bits of the mac'n cheese within giving it a contrasting chewy texture. It's a plate that is hard to imagine so it's best to try it yourself.Walking away, I think the biggest surprise was that when we were there, the people were very nice to us which is so unlike the image I had of them based on their reputation.  All that anticipation of a hard time...wasted... sigh. I have seen the documentary about Shopshin's called ""I like killing Flies"" so I know how rude they could get but it seems like if you respect their rules, they will treat you with respect in turn. With the large menu, I would be happy and even thrilled to go back to this establishment to try out more of their creative recipes if they are all up to par with what we tasted that day.",32,0.9879

I feel all responsibility slipping away, and my heart hurts as I hear that each cocktail would cost me $14. I am ANTI fancy expensive cocktails, but sometimes you just have to act like you're hot shit to feel like shit the next morning. You'd think that having no menu would be liberating. You'd think it would be a pinch. I had a panic attack at the number of options. A chalk wall boasted a myriad of fresh fruits, herbs, and veggies for flava. I couldn't decide! So I started with a ""refreshing herbal bourbon based drink"". I got a clementine & thyme concoction. It was fantastic. And easily my LEAST favorite drink of the evening. Halfway through I switched with my girl and finished her Kiwi Honeydew drink. Mmm. Those kiwi seeds (nature's pop rocks) really took the drink to THE NEXT LEVEL. Every drink following was awesome, I think the most impressive was my friend's blackberry ginger gin drink. The bartender put like 5340986 different things in there. It was amazing, complex, and refreshing all at the same time. I wanted to cry. I begged for another sip, and then I asked him to make something similar with bourbon. It just wasn't phenomenal. The food was pretty decent. The pork belly needs a lot of work, but they get points for serving it on apple chips. I really liked the tuna tartare with what was basically guac on top. It was accompanied by a watermelon gelee and chopped cucumber. I could eat 10lbs of tuna tartare. 10lbs. The sweet potato fries were..sweet potato fries, and they proved to be a fantastic vehicle for the scrumptious chipotle mayo. I should not eat 10lbs of chipotle mayo. I'd definitely return again, but it would be:A) After paying my friends back for my bar tab lololol      andB) for one or two drinks. You really don't need to get this drunk.

After all, going out of business from a dearth of word of mouth may be a more disagreeable event than being run amok with popularity.This was a great find because it closed the gap I had lingering about two things I heard about from friends: 1) the wonders of West African shawarma and 2) the eclectic food that came out of a former French-African restaurant in Brooklyn-Korhogo 126.

Kuti's main feature is shawarma, Middle Eastern sandwiches by way of West Africa. I used to be under the impression that the Lebanese made a fine shawarma but a former Ivory Coast colleague of mine used to chide me for my so-called simple tastes. She extolled the virtues of her home country's shawarma, claiming that the difference was second to none. And you know what? I'm almost inclined to agree after tasting Kuti's lamb shawarma. Seriously, I thought my head was going to explode from gastronomic euphoria after tasting the potent potable. Succulent, crispy shards of rich, earthy lamb are deftly shaved off a spit and bundled up in pita bread. The meat is delicately flavoured with coriander, cumin and ras-el-hanout spices. Stewed lemony peas, tomato, pickles and steak fries complete the fixings. After a few dashes of hot sauce, the wrap is put in a panini press for a few minutes until the exterior reaches a golden crunchy brown. The rest of the shawarma flavours vary: homemade merguez, beef tongue, liver, kidney, brain (yes!), peri-peri shrimp and chicken. Hey, chicken is chicken but Kuti's serves a tasty version which they label as West African jerk. The dark meat pieces are tender and carry a nice smokey flavour. Be prepared to do some gnawing though, it comes with a lot of bones.Portions are huge and the prices are fantastic. $5 for a sandwich or $7-8 for a platter of meat, rice, potatoes and veg.They get a lot of business from the taxi and livery cab drivers that stop by for a quick bite on the go. Some will tell you that the velvety liver is dope, while others opine that the shrimp is beautifully sautéed and has a nice peppery kick. But oh man, that lamb is something else. It's renewed a food lust inside me for all things that go 'bahhhhh!'",56,0.9914
1205,20,15,4.0,"""I can't eat that.""""Why? Is something wrong?""""It's just too pretty.""Beautiful - that's the word that comes first to mind when you enter graffit. The decor is breathtaking - with three sections designed in different ways, you pass from a bar area to a classy dining room with mirrors and graffiti on the walls, to a sunlight back area with a distinct garden feel. And it's not just the interiors, each dish that I've tried there has been conceptualized in a moment of inspiration. The plating is absolutely gorgeous. The execution is mostly nice, with a few exceptions.I've been here several times, for brunch and dinner. While the portions are not large, I think the brunch menu is quite interesting. I do have a gripe though - the sweet section of the brunch menu should really be called dessert. I honestly don't think anyone eats that much whipped cream with their pancakes, or eats a deconstructed cappucino or those mediocre churros for brunch. No sir, they don't. It's dessert, alright. I do however recommend the tortillas and their poached eggs. Their fresh ricotta is delicious too.Their dinner menu does offer much less variety for vegetarians, but has enough to keep me interested. Also, they are happy to serve tapas from the bar room in the main dining area, so do ask. The ""egg"" with the vegetable stew is one of my favourite dishes. It's mild, earthy and flavourful and I have no idea how they injected a whole egg yolk into cauliflower puree but it is genius. I have heard great things about the carrot cake but the creamy kale is average and the roots dish is just plain daylight robbery. I am not about to shell out my precious 14 dollars for a bunch of chopped turnips and daikon. Among the carnivorous eats, my friend enjoyed her suckling pig dish muchly.They also have a great selection of Spanish wine and serve a mean cocktail, often with stuff like lemon dust or bergamot mist or apple foam thrown in. I would recommend trying the beet goes on.. but only if you like beets. and celery. (I know I am talking to a pretty tiny audience here). Among the desserts, the warm liquid is a must try! The spanish moscatel is interesting as well, but I found the cheesecake a tad unidimensional despite its components. To be fair, it's only their version 1. I'm waiting for the rest.I certainly have been here with some people who agree that it is one of the most arrestingly beautiful food they have laid their eyes on, but it is form over function. I'll let you decide, but where else would you find patatas bravas served in a Piet Mondrian style?P.S. Check out their forks and knives. It's like the Avatar version of silverware.",23,0.9982

I've tried about 2/3rds of the menu and am aiming to try everything.Despite the orange colors which remind me of the Yelp stars, it's actually a pretty cool place to chill and have dinner with friends. The ceiling is a little low so it does make it very loud in here but it's very casual.Some of my faves include:The chop chop saladImperialist hot dogBibimbap burger (this won best Burger in NY!)Smoked ribsHot wingsThe Bulgogi burgerThe Hanoi burgerSome things to skip entirely:Southeast Asian pickles - No flavor and not enough pickleling.Both desserts (Yuzu cream puffs & chocolate toffee brownie).When I went, they didn't have their liquor license yet but I've heard they got it now. Also when I went Angelo was making his rounds but I didn't get to catch him. I'd already met him during his first week of opening when he was giving out free food. He's actually really nice in person and not at all like his TV persona from TC. He does however wear tight pants and dwarfs me in comparison. Maybe it's his low ceiling's in the restaurant?The burgers are huge and really messy to eat, and cooked medium but the flavors are deeply embedded into the meat and toppings. I wonder if they made them into bite size sliders if they'd be easier to eat?The wait kind of sucks because they're still new but hopefully it'll get better.",15,0.9828

Don't come here if you're trying to get greens with every meal. Even the ""salad"" is basically just delicious, fatty avocado atop a pile of crunchy water.

I was not feeling happy about what I had to eat after the damage was done, but while I was downing it, I was highly enjoying myself.The options are endless:Cheeseburger Nosh (self explanatory),Mediterranean Nosh (goat cheese, spinach, olives and garlic)Alpine Nosh (gruyere and BACON)Parisienne Nosh (brie, figs, mushrooms, rosemary)Cajun Nosh (cheddar, jack, andouille sausage, bell pepp, onions, etc)Buffalo Chicken Nosh (cheddar, blue cheese with boneless chicken and wing sauce, duh)ETCBesides having gluten free or multi grain macaroni, S'Mac also offers reduced lactose cheese, and has some vegan/vegetarian options (ew). You're also able to add on any other items/mix-ins for an additional $1. I decided on the buffalo chicken nosh and it definitely did not disappoint. Super greasy, super spicy (plus added tobasco), and 100% filling. Typically, I'm the girl who will lick the plate clean no matter how full I am, but after 1/2-3/4 of the MAJOR MUNCH size aka medium (super gluttonous), I couldn't fit anymore in my stomach, plus I felt ill. The staff wasn't very friendly and seemed like they were rushing us out. Other than that, I'd definitely go back, but order the smallest, NOSH, size. You must be insane to order the MONGO. I was still feeling grotesque the next day. I don't plan on going back any time soon, but what a treat!",10,0.9048
1209,14,5,4.0,"I must come clean before I write this review... I was completely ready to dislike Salt & Fat. I do not write about places I don't like and I was just about sure I would have nothing to say about it. I was in the mood for something salty and fatty while sipping on a fourth or fifth Guinness across the street, but it was just a guilty pleasure kind of meal.They had me at ""...popped in bacon fat,"" which their complimentary small bag of popcorn is. It did a nice job of loosening my defenses so that I could enjoy the rest of the meal as much as possible.The place itself is a weird little pocket to pop up in Sunnyside, a facade and menu that might feel more comfortable in Williamsburg or Greenpoint. The interiors seem more formal than the people and food, which is 100% casual. It has weird classical accents but for the most part is awkwardly minimal. I might be intimidated if the prices were higher.It is pretty new, and obviously getting its traction, but most of the food we had was very good. The Hampshire pulled pork sliders ($9) do not disappoint, with juicy meat, a nice toasted bun, and a cucumber that somehow imposes its will on each bite.Also served in a plate of three were the short rib buns ($8), which in my opinion were all about the apricot mustard. The meat and bread is good, but this apricot spread (not that mustard-y) was really perfect in there.Lastly, we had the shining star of the meal, the fried chicken ($12), a healthy portion of pieces served with an herb ranch dipping sauce. Unfortunately the skin here has been removed, but the crispy exterior and marinade is so good it doesn't matter. It had a striking similarity to eating salt & pepper chips, if those tastes could be transfered to chicken. Even the thick white meat pieces stay very juicy, and there was not one bite that did not satisfy.For dessert, we could not resist the lychee panna cotta and yuzu buttermilk sorbet ($6), which successfully caters to two desires of sweetness. I really loved the cold sorbet but also could not help going back to the creamy panna cotta. Interestingly, the two do not taste very good when eaten in the same bite, but no matter, they come plated as if to resist each other.So Queens Boulevard now has a trendy go-to new American eatery to lean on. It's definitely better than it might sound on paper!",18,0.9972
1210,23,29,4.0,"We set a menu on fire.Before we could panic, and even before the table next to us noticed, one of the waiters grabbed the flaming laminated paper and doused it with water. And walked away, and brought a new one. With a smile. Now THAT'S what I call service!!!!!!!!After we nearly destroyed Pegu, we commenced drinking. I'm sort of in love with Dark and Stormys (dark rum, ginger beer and lime), but Pegu's version - called the Jamaican Firefly - is far superior, and is served with a delicious slice of candied ginger. If you mash it up into the drink, it's phenomenal. I also tried a drink called the Gin Gin Mule, which is also made with ginger beer, but has sprigs of fresh mint that make it taste like an entirely different drink (which, um, it is). The seating is comfortable and the decor is classy. There are candles and dried flowers on every table (ripe for burning). As others have mentioned, it has a speakeasy feel - replete with ""mixologists"" - without the snottiness of a place that's trying to be undercover. The drink list is delightful to read, especially because it's fun to imagine what these concoctions might taste like, and you get to ask what certain ingredients are. This is no Jack & Coke joint, people. Be prepared for sweet and sour and bitter and ginger and interesting colors served in interesting glasses.It's good to go early to snag a table, especially if you're a party of 3 or more. I also recommend sharing drinks, since they are all delicious and unique. Oh, and try not to knock over any candles.",25,0.9972
1211,9,7,4.0,"Nice find! I've been wanting to try this new, trendy Russian bath house thing for a while. After asking around Yelp, seeing less than stellar reviews at the main one located in Manhattan, in the East Village- lo and behold Travelzoo was offering a day pass for $15 to this place (normally a $30 value). Score! I realized it wasn't too far to get to, and would be the perfect place to unwind with my bf (after NY Mag wrote it as a spot for a ""hot date""). Just take the B or Q out to Beverly Road and walk left for 3-4 blocks to Coney Island Avenue. We came around 4pm on a weekday so the place was not crowded- the front desk lady was super nice and had no qualms with our deal voucher. She explained where the locker rooms were, where to get towels etc. They provide towels, and locks. The place isn't really that big but it has everything it describes: a cold pool (regular, rather- it's not ""icy"" as described- the trick is to go in AFTER enduring heat, then it feels reaaaally cold), a heated pool (jacuzzi), wet and dry sauna, and steam room. I would say that it's moderately clean. It's clean for the most part but you see bits of grime here and there. Let's say it passes just fine but it's not pristine or ""spa"" like. The clientele are authentic Russians (who splash buckets of cold water on each other in the steam room, ha ha), who speak the language, day-drink vodka, and eat eat eat!  The restaurant seems spacious and clean- you can eat outside near the pool area. A waitress comes around to take your order, and seemed a bit disheartened when all we ask for was tap water. She curtly smiled and then brought us a whole jug and tiny plastic cups. *shrug*. I was there for the facilities, not the food (not a fan of Russian food anyhow).Note: you should bring some magazines or books to at least keep yourself company because after a while you just want to sit near the pools and chill without putting your body through drastic temperature changes. We hit the steam room first- it wasn't extremely steamy as first but some of the local folks put cold water into the radiator and whoooosh out came way more steam. It gets a little too steamy so that you can barely see anything! It was good for my bf though, who had a bit of a chest cold...but a little unbearable after 10 minutes so we left to take a rinse in the shower, and then dipped into the ""cold"" pool- which I stated was not cold. A small, 3.5 feet deep pool to relax and do a little horseplay. We got pruny and then left to try the dry sauna- which was a scorching 200 degrees Fahrenheit. We spent about 5 minutes in here- it's a REAL sauna. All wood- heated by a coal oven. Nothing like the electric kind they have at your gym- the real deal! We then went to try the wet sauna- which was about the same temperature, add on major humidity! Occasionally, you will share the rooms with others (and if the locals in the steam room, loord help you haha)- but overall, we had the rooms to ourselves- it wasn't crowded. The saunas were a bit dirty. I laid my head down on my bf's lap. Occasionally, a worker will come in; ask how you're bearing the heat and then fire more heat by throwing water onto the oven.  The last stop was the heated pool- I liked this the least, but it's just me. It would have been an amazing touch after a big workout to relieve soreness but I don't know, my showers are never that hot, and it was a little TOO hot for me. I got out after 5 minutes . The nice thing is that they have a ledge installed, where you can sit down and melt away. I did dip into the ""cool"" pool once more and it did indeed feel icy! Just like how the Russians do it :) I recommend doing this- it felt nice! We hit the steam room once last time before we left- and I looked like a raccoon by this point due to all the loose mascara on my face. Ladies! No makeup at this joint, or minimal as possible if you really ARE on a date; otherwise your eyes will be runny and look scary. Locker rooms are spacious (of course I can speak for ladies' only)- but again, not as clean as could be. Not bad by any means- but I bet Equinox gym is cleaner. They have showers (with no curtains) and drying hand soap if you must for a rinse. They also have flip flops which they can loan (ew factor) you so you can walk around (which you MUST otherwise you might get warts, ringworms and other nasty shit), so PLEASE remember to bring your flip flops. In any case, I really liked it here. It was relaxing in the middle of winter and overall, a great health benefit. But I've had the experience, it's kind of far, and it's normally $30, so I'd say I'd probably not come back (or I'd try another place). Travelzoo also had the deal come with a 60 minute massage, but it then became $60. I don't know that I'd recommend this- I can't say for sure, but I didn't see any massage rooms per se - just one of those massage chairs you see in the middle of mall near the rooms (er. ok).",19,0.9983

1213,9,9,4.0,"Last Friday night, the parentals came to town. Had to take them somewhere nice. Since the Mussel Pot opened, its been constantly abuzz so it was time to check it out. The atmosphere is perfect for family/friend get togethers, and also great for dates: upscale but approachable, lively but not overbearingly loud. Cozy bar upfront, and a small outdoor space in the back which will be open for dining shortly. Excellent service - water glass and cocktails were never empty, the waitress knew the menu, and Giorgio (the manager) made sure he was a presence at each table. The first few spoonfuls of the lobster bisque were astounding...but it was so rich that after a while that I couldn't take it anymore. Same trajectory as an episode of the Housewives of Orange County. Main course was the Louisiana Mussel Pot: andouille sausage, shrimp, fried okra, scallions. There's no way one person should finish this entire thing...which means 75% of Americans probably will. I'd estimate there were 40 mussels and 3 colossal shrimp (looked to be u/15s) in this pot. Deliciousness. Recommend sharing one of these with whoever you're with. At $17, not a bad deal especially if you're splitting. Aim (Mom) got the salmon. She clean plated it.  Pops (Dad) got the blue mussel rigatoni. The lobster cream sauce was too heavy for his taste, but gave a head nod to the mussels. Giorgio brought over a complimentary piece of homemade cheesecake for the table (that's how the Q's roll). Aim and Pops said it was the best cheesecake they'd had in 2011. In summary: be cautious of any cream-based dishes, you may be overwhelmed...share a pot of mussels (don't go it alone)...and if you like cheesecake you're in for a treat.",14,0.9958
1214,8,4,4.0,"This space used to occupied by an old slice joint, but after renovating the space it looks like they kept around a few signs from the old place as mementos or trophies of war. From what I saw of how this places operates however, as opposed to most of the new pizza places opening in this area of Brooklyn, thankfully its the former. Its very homey inside, and they even had a kids' menu with a large mom-and-kid clientele to match. The menu was basic with only pizza, salad, and pasta, but had a good mix of basic and more ambitious options. The service was very friendly and relaxed, with the owner front and center but not lording over things. I loved this place as an establishment, and thankfully the food matched up. The pizza I got was called ""Will to Live"" This was worth ordering if not only for the epic receipt I received at the meal, as it was labeled on there as such. Anyway, it had fresh mozzarella, shallots, pecorino romano, blood orange slices, and watercress. While this sounds like one of those pizzas that a chef might think of when he's high, it simply worked. The crust was a great example of the Roman style: thin and crackery, with the end crust having some nice softness to it and a bit of char too. The mozzarella, romano, and shallots blended together beautifully, and were subtle and delicious. The watercress added a little pepper in, and the blood orange brought it all together. The bittersweet juice combined perfectly with the rest of the ingredients. The biggest reason I'm not giving a better rating is because the blood orange slices were cut way too thick on average, and there were far too many of them. They were overwhelming things, so I ate some of them off and we were good. . Cheating notwithstanding, this was still a great combo and a great pie, and thus worthy of the rating. Instead of super pretentious pizza restaurants, this is exactly the kind of simple places that need to open in New York because they will resonate with the local populace and thus do well. I'm also glad to see a Roman pizza place that represents the style well, as this is only the second I've found thats even worth mentioning. Very strange, seeing as pizza al taglio is similar to our grandma slices, and Roman pizza bears a resemblance to Staten Island ""old-fashioned"" style pizza. Suffice to say, this place is a winner and I will be back.",9,0.9983

Bar Seats, Please!Matthew Piacentini opened this spot with the help of former colleague Dan Greenbaum (of Brooklyn Social) to construct a cocktail list that pairs well with the New American menu put together by Chef Garrett Eagleton. The Cocktails: Love the creative list with a mix of Classics usually overlooked (Sherry Cobbler), twists on Classics (the Tequila Based Negroni Variation called La Rosita) and a whole host of interesting originals. The Astor Painless Anesthetic with Gin, Armagnac, Bonal, Cocchi Americano and Orange Bitters is a great booze forward drink. Interestingly, they shake this drink instead of stirring it despite the lack of citrus. When I asked, they said ""we like to break the rules"". The Longines Cocktail is a really interesting refreshing drink with a lot of layers and punch. Cognac base with Gunpowder Tea, Anis Del Mono and Fresh Lemon. In the future, they will also have some Barrel Aged cocktails, but they are still in the process of aging them. One of the bartenders is Tom Richter, who supplies one of the better Handcrafted Tonics out there to places like Freeman's, Hearth, Rye House, Il Bucco etc. (Tomr's Tonic: tomshandcrafted.com/toni…). So of course, Tom's Gin and Tonic is on the menu. This is no ordinary Gin and Tonic, and if you haven't been a fan in the past, it's highly recommended. Quite frankly, if you don't like it you will never be a Gin and Tonic person. The Food: The menu is overflowing with things that make my mouth go ""WANT!!!!"". I will say, that while most things we tried were solid to good, this is where I had some issues. A lot has to do with size. Some of the tidbits like the Pork Rillette and Dates were totally worth the price point. The small plates? Not so much. The poached egg in particular is $14 for one egg and some asparagus spears. I really enjoyed the Lamb Neck Pairing Board that comes with a mini Preakness Cocktail (basically a Rye Manhattan with half Benedictine and half Sweet Vermouth), but only after getting past the incredibly over cooked/charred crust on the outside.As it's not on their website yet, you can find a link to the menu here..images.nymag.com/images/…Overall, Solid experience, but be warned that most of the plates are extremely small servings. Also, bar seating is extremely limited here (6 or 7 seats).

On this particular night, we began with dinner at Lederhosen in the West Village, then moved onto drinks at Vol de Nuit (yes, Belgian, I know) and then further onward to Zum Schneider. Vorwärts!One of the first people in my father's family not to be born in Hamburg, I have a bit more wide-eyed excitement at the idea of these establishments. I do resent them if executed poorly, but generally the idea of long tables, tall beers, and cheerful clink-clink of friends becoming tipsier and tipsier - these things ignite the German in me. Wandering the streets of the East Village and surveying the alternative drinking locales, I could not understand why someone would frequent a sh***y lounge full of blowouts, spray tans, and 13 dollar Coronas when a comfortable seat, good chums, and a 12 dollar giant mug of Weihenstephan are only a Zum Schneider away. (For those who don't know, Weihenstephan is the oldest operating brewery in Germany, and a delicious draught, if you can find it). There are, admittedly, a good number of douch-tastic NYU kids in here on the weekends. I don't actually have a problem with NYU students on an individual basis, they all tend to be at least tolerable, but as a group, they descend onto locations with a vengeance and locust-like fury that can knock a star or two off of even the most concrete of Yelp ratings. The decor is fairly spot on, insofar as we could have hoped. Beer flags and exposed beams abound, without coming across as overly affected or Epcot-y (""Irish pubs"" do that, and I could not hate it more). The back area, through the arched gaps in the wall, is as cozy as can be, and is horribly conducive to further bonding of both close friends and strangers alike. The music is a bit off - not the accordion yodeling cartoons would have you imagine of such a place (thank God), but some Chumba Wumba was blared at a certain juncture.

And Basquiat's paintings look like a bipolar 3rd grader went nuts on canvas. I said it - it's finally out in the open. You know you think so too.Now to elaborate...Atmosphere: Unlike some, I am not bothered by the Time Warner Center location. I've been to a fair number of malls in my life and although TWC houses retail stores, it's hardly a standard mall. Once inside Per Se, the environment is much like a restaurant at a swanky, boutique hotel. You enter into a less-than-glamorous waiting area, but the dining room is peaceful and minimalistic (borderline sterile). Everything is clean and crisp. The dining room is a semi-tiered amphitheater, where every table looks out onto the city through a wall of windows.Service:Service is outstanding. Many of the employees have worked with Keller for years, including a few French Laundry veterans who moved to NY to help start Per Se. Food:Not as great as I wanted it to be. Now it's true that Per Se's reputation is difficult to live up to, especially because I expect as close to perfection as possible. But even cutting them some slack, I didn't eat a single thing that felt truly innovative or memorable. Desserts were especially boring (sorbet, apricot tart, etc). Don't get me wrong... it's very good. But $250 good? Not so much. Especially when there are surcharges for all the most appealing items.Worth Noting:- Jackets are required for gentlemen. If you are jacket-less, they have loaners on hand.- Purse stools available on request- They can always accommodate dietary needs... it doesn't have to be an allergy. If you dislike something, let them know. It's too expensive to suffer through a course.- Ask for a kitchen tour! They are accustomed to giving them. Look out for the 2 way television that connects to the kitchen at French Laundry. BUT make sure to ask for the tour at the end of your meal. Otherwise, you may find yourself surprised and ushered out to the waiting room instead of your table. (Beware, this is a FABULOUS trick to get people to leave. They will literally clear your table and bring your bags up front.)- If you want wine pairing, there is no set menu. They pair based on your needs and desires. I would advise giving them a budget, however (unless you have a black AmEx. In that case, get wild. And feel free to bring me with you). - They can write personalized menus if requested at the time of the reservation.

The cucumber yoghurt was delish; refreshing and full of flavor, I could also eat this every day using the pita bread they gave us (mmm... more carbs).

You know what was even better? Being brilliant and dipping the already amazing bread into the tastebud-blowing mussel curry!My entree came out and it didn't disappoint. I ordered the lamb cous cous and umm... wow. Tender, perfectly cooked meat sat atop some of the best cous cous I've had. The cous cous was light, fluffy, and above all not too buttery or salty. Although some of my dining companions weren't as enthused as I was with their entrees, I'd still sit down to eat here any time. That is... assuming I could find a seat after 6:45pm. The place seemed to fill up mighty quickly for a random weekday dinner. Friendly service, good food, and MORE-roccan food? I'm in.",17,0.9921
1221,18,15,4.0,"No bunny was harmed in the making of bunny chow. What is bunny chow? Food made from bunnies? Food for bunnies? Nope! It's a delicious South African Indian curry served inside a hollowed loaf of bread. Everyone should be down for some bunny chow. The etymology for bunny chow is under debate, but it definitely originated in Durban, SA where there is a large community of people of Indian descent. What I really enjoy about South African cuisine is that it has such a strong influence of the various cuisines and cultures that have infiltrated the country. It's a melting pot of incredible rich flavors where you recognize the place of origin, but you still see that South Africans have put their own twist and made it uniquely South African. Like the bunny chow! The flavor of bunny chow was absolutely delicious. You clearly taste Indian spices (cumin, which I love, was particularly strong), but it's not like any Indian curry that you've ever had. I loved eating the parts of the bread that had soaked up the curry sauce. So soft and redolent with pungent spices. We loved the seafood bunny chow so much that we ordered another one. Next time, we'll just get our own bunny chows! Bunny chow! Bunny chow! So fun to say too. :DI really enjoyed the Sauvignon Blanc. It was a great great wine -- beautiful body with a touches of mineral and fruity notes. Perfectly-balanced. A glass is only $6 and they actually serve it to you in a little carafe, so you end up with a glass and a half really. We had an order of Xai Xai salad (baby greens, thinly sliced papaya, roasted mushrooms, and goat cheese dressed with a ginger-lemon-guava dressing). It was nice and light. I loved the fresh taste of papaya and the umami of the roasted mushrooms. The dressing was tossed with a light hand (nice!), but I didn't taste the ginger whatsoever.Frikadelle is a German/Dutch meatball dish with a diced tomato sauce. The meat was tender and juicy. For dessert we finished off with Koeksisters because who the heck can resist koeksisters (especially when it looks like KOCKSISTERS in the menu because of the weird font they used). All I can say is that it was twisted and just a little sweet. What was underneath couldn't handle the heat and melted.Overall the quality of the food was 3.5, but I rounded up to 4 stars because it's a great little place for a date (cozy, dark wood, exposed brick, candles, etc), prices are very reasonable, and who can resist BUNNY CHOW!",22,0.9982

1224,22,10,4.0,"Fake meat is murder. Or at the very least, an offense to one's culinary sensibilities. On my soapbox, I've decried the contemptible existence of fake meat products that some less enlightened restaurants serve for their vegetarian punters. To wit; tofurkey, textured vegetable protein made to vaguely resemble bacon or sausage, soy scrambled 'eggs'? Balaboosta save us.Balaboosta serves as a reliable denotation that vegetarian food *CAN* be exciting. Sexy even.We'd unconsciously ordered an almost completely vegetarian meal, not because of any inclination towards healthier or wealthier goals, but because these were the most appealing dishes on the menu. Fried cauliflower with a sprinkle of currants and pine nuts was addictive-ly good. So was the za'atar flecked patatas bravas, which arrived screaming hot and crispy with a luxurious side of garlic aioli. Course after course arrived, with nary the animal protein component that one comes to expect from the New York dining experience. A smoked eggplant bruschetta, with a baby soft puree of eggplant topped with a wonderfully refreshing parsley salad was so good, that we talked of canceling our main course in lieu of another order of bruschetta. Similar talk followed after a course of dreamy sunchoke and chestnut soup, topped with a finicky dallop of crème fraiche and sprinkle of nigela seeds.To further drive home the point of this review, our main course of Balaboosta's famous preparation of half chicken cooked 'under a brick', the lone source of animal protein of the meal, was the least exciting dish of the evening. Oh sure, the chicken was deftly cooked - the innards moist and the exterior pleasantly crispy. But the conceptualizer of this dish had lost their nerve with the seasoning, and the brilliance of the previous parade of vegetarian dishes faded to a weak after-glow.",20,0.9522
1225,21,17,4.0,"My latest food addiction is the black-sesame ""doughnut"" ($1.80) at Paris Baguette. After a Korean meal in K-Town, I'll get a doughnut. If I'm nearby shopping at Macy's, gotta get a doughnut. On the subway passing through midtown, might as well make use of my unlimited MetroCard and duck out for a doughnut.Despite its name, the doughnut is really more like a morbidly obese Munchkin--about the size of a rubber squash ball. The outer shell is resistantly crisp-chewy from the rice flour while the hollow interior oozes a gooey seasonal filling. (These days it's pumpkin.) As expected, this outpost of the Korean bakery chain has all the standard Korean pastries like croquettes, streusel bread, doughnut twists, red-bean filled buns, and other flaky, crusty, buttery things in addition to sandwiches, jams, and breads including their namesake baguette.And because I see way too many customers here who don't know how to procure their baked goods, let me break it down for you:1. Get a tray 2. Line it with deli paper3. Use the serving tongs to grab items5. Pay at the register6. Take away your purchase or eat inMove down to the vitrine and you'll see a variety of highly decorated cakes in flavors like blueberry-green tea and tiramisu.

They're excellent birthday cakes for people like me who don't like overly sweet desserts.[1]Other things to note:- If you want to pronounce the name commes les Koreans, leave off the last S in ""Paris"" (for savings? I don't know).- They have coffee, green tea latte and scalding hot tea that comes in fancy silk pouches.- It's the friendliest service I've ever had at a Korean establishment and the cashiers are bilingual.- Avoid weekend afternoons lest you be subject to the ear-splitting chatter of gossipy Korean aunties. - It's not polite to point and laugh out loud at the male employees dressed like Marcel Marceau.

1226,29,26,4.0,"On a rainy evening, while in search of this little place, I passed by a shuttered restaurant and saw the dimly lit words ""Islands"" and ""Jamaican"" and went NOOOOOOOO!!!!! All that traveling halfway through Brooklyn for this much raved about Jerk Chicken and it ran out of business? Then I squinted through the rain, looked closer and saw that the place that closed shop was actually called ""Islands Tast"" (That is not my typo) and that I was actually a block from my real destination. Calming down slightly from my momentary panic attack, I arrived at The Islands and went indoors.Whoa that interior was small. You enter and just like that the ordering counter is right in front of you with maybe a few short feet of moving space between you and the wall. The matronly lady by the counter casually asked me am I new to the place? With a nod, I answered yes and went about my business of ordering. The rice orders comes as either small or large, the large being about $2 more per order. Thinking that I wanted try more then one selection here, I chose two small orders, assuming it'll be tiny enough to manage. My thought when my orders came was, ""Damn if that is the small size, I can't imagine the big one."" The portion size was generous.My orders:Jerk Chicken. This dish must be filled with crack. It's so moist, juicy, flavorful, and surprisingly had a decent spicy kick to it. The meat was of the fall of the bone variety and the skin was peppery, well spiced, and slightly soft but not soggy. The rice with beans that I chose with this order was just as good.The beans infuses the incredibly soft rice with it's flavor and gives it a slightly sweet taste. Not that I know what crack is like mind you. No.. really. I just assumed that it's like eating this dish. Once I start, I can't stop. Help me... I think it's my new addiction..... One of the best Jerk Chicken I've had in NYC.Curry Goat with a side of salad. It's pretty tasty if you could get past the gamy taste of this particular type of meat. The chunks of goat meat were tender if a bit chewy, and pieces of it came with the bones still attached. The rice this time was infused with the non spicy green curry sauce that smothered the whole dish. The side salad came in it's own small Styrofoam container. I was expecting a typical bland salad but this pleasantly surprised me. The salad was drenched in a light semi sweet dressing and consists of (from my memory) leafy greens, raisins, red peppers, yellow peppers, cucumbers, onions and probably one or two ingredients I don't recall. I would happily order the larger version of this from the menu if I had to.I took everything to go. There is an upstairs dining area (Which I heard was also super tiny) but in order to eat in, it costs an extra $2 per person. I would happily tip more for great service but no way in hell was I paying extra just to sit down.Luckily, this place is located across the street from The Brooklyn Museum, a few blocks from The Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, and more importantly, a block from Prospect Park. In warmer weather, I suggest taking it to go and eating it nearby.I think I could understand why that other Jamaican Restaurant had to close down. It's hard to imagine staying in business with a rival that makes food as fantastic as this place only a mere block away. Especially with that Crack Chic...

1227,16,9,4.0,"About a week ago, while I was in the car I saw this new place opened up. I passed by so fast that I didn't really make out the name of the place and even til now holding their business card in my hand, I'm not sure how to pronounce the name. ""Tab-bil-isi"" I would think.With my adventurous parents, I chose this place for dinner because I never had Georgian food before. For some odd reason, this location is considered a cafe bakery, but they have restaurant foods. They do have a real restaurant also in Brooklyn, which I believe their food menu would have more selections. The decor here was really simple and they also have a yard area for dining as well. Our servers were really friendly and informative when we asked them about the foods on the menu.For drinks, we ordered a large Geogian Limonade, which was green. It looked like mouth wash water, but it did not taste like it. I'm not sure what flavor it is, but the flavor reminds of black jelly beans.For soup, we ordered a Chakapuli - it is made from onions, lamb chops, dry white wine, tarragon leaves, tkemali sauce (plum sauce), mixed fresh herbs (parsley, mint, dill, cilantro), garlic and salt. This soup was pretty good and very flavorful.For appetizer, we ordered Badrijani Nigvzit- Eggplants seasoned with ground walnuts, vinegar (or pomegranate juice), pomegranates and spices. I am not really an eggplant person, but the way they made this dish was amazing. I liked how the walnut is crushed and it's infused into the eggplant, which brings out the taste of both eggplant and walnut without overpowering each other. I liked it a lot.We also ordered the Xinkali - pork buns with a soup base inside each bun. These pork buns reminds me of the soup dumplings at Shanghai cuisines, but the texture and taste is very different. The Xinkali does not have as much soup as soup dumplings does. The Xinkali are also bigger in size compared to the soup dumplings. This dish was good.I'm not sure is it because we didn't really know what to order, but it seems as though a lot of foods are bread and cheese in different variations. We've ordered Acharuli Xachapuri - bread formed into an open boat shape and the hot pie is topped with a raw egg and a pat of butter. This was pretty interesting and it was tasted really good.Another form of dough with cheese we had was Imeruli Xachapuri, which is in a circular form and it is the most common type. It reminds me of a big cheesy pancake. This was was good too, but I liked the Acharuli Xachapuri more.We also ordered Achma - which has multiple layers of cheese and looks more like a sauceless lasagna. This one was pretty good too, but I liked eating this with the very soft complimentary bread.We also ordered the lamb shish kebab, which was really tasty and grilled very nicely. It was very tender and the burnt parts were just right. It was also flavorful and not chewy at all.Last but not least, we've ordered the fried chicken in garlic sauce. This dish took the longest to come out, but I think it's because it was slowly roasting in the oven. When this dish came out, the aroma of garlic filled the air. I was so happy there were so much garlic rubbed on the chicken because I really love garlic. The chicken was so good! The skin was crispy and the meat was so tender and not dry at all.It was an interesting experience with Georgian food. Everything we've tried tasted really good. Just with all the dough and cheese variations I was getting really stuffed from those alone. So the next time I order Georgian food, I'll make sure not to order so many kinds of cheese and bread lol.",16,0.9984

1229,55,40,4.0,"As an English-Canadian, it's somewhat ironic and amusing to find not one, but two Quebec owned restaurants taking New York by storm in recent months. In hockey terms, it's akin to being a Maple Leafs buff traveling halfway across the world, only to find out the locals are die hard Habs fans.You see, Quebec is the sexy cousin that drinks early, fucks around and generally traipses about without a thought in the world. Less Joe Clark, more Pierre Trudeau. Mitsou. Strip clubs that are beloved by American bachelors on the Eastern seaboard. It's got that extra somethun, somethun that the RoC (rest of Canada) chastises but wishes it could have. So, really it should come as no surprise that the ""Canadian"" food invasion of New York has been engineered by la belle province. Mile End kicked it off last winter by introducing Montreal smoked meat and poutine to the masses. And now M. Wells seems poised to wrestle some of the foodie spotlight by offering an inspired, eclectic take on diner food. I first heard about M. Wells last winter when I ordered a tourtiere -traditional Quebec meat pie- from the owners at one of the local markets. It was a decadent, savory mix of foie gras, pheasant, pork and brisket encased in a thick, buttery crust. The pie was supposed to serve 4 easily but the hubby (a quebecer) and I, being the fatties that we are, took a voracious pleasure in wolfing it down. Shortly thereafter, we were informed that the owners were opening a LIC diner. I waited with bated breath. And waited...until reports of approval, awe and satisfaction rolled in from fellow diners. Finally, after seeing so much good press, I deemed a visit as necessary as a proverbial cleaning of the pipes. In other words, I needed to get it out of my system....Many have regarded the menu as Quebecois or French Canadien fare but I think that would be an oversimplification. The tourtiere, buckwheat crepes (ploye) and Pâté chinois (quebec shepherd's pie) are nods in that direction, but the menu also features a mishmash of dishes that pay tribute to the diversity of Queens. Here's what I've had so far:-Bone Marrow with Escargots. Two French bistro standbys yes, but hardly something Bonhomme or Jean Guy Tabernack would be enjoying on a regular basis. A flintstone-esque bone split lengthwise with fat escargots resting in the rich marrow topped off with a gratin of breadcrumbs, butter and herbs. This was supposed to be an exquisite exercise in hard and soft but it tasted rather flat for me. Earlier reviews had this dish paired with a red wine puree, that might have provided a nice contrast.-Brussel sprout bacon hash. A puck of creamy fried hashbrowns served with browned brussel sprouts, smokey bacon bits and a silky poached egg on top. Well prepared hollandaise permeates every bite of this wonderful breakfast dish.-Pickled pork tongue. This is a true quebec brasserie classic. A no fuss, tasty appetizer that breaks apart into tender tangy forkfuls. Off-ally good. Served with a stiff dijon and homemade soda crackers.-Cubano. M. Wells take on one of my favourite sandwiches. I appreciate the effort but I'll stick to my regular haunts for this. It's a well pressed hoagie attended to with generous lashings of butter. But I didn't think the roast pork, mortadella, thick mayo and cheese melded enough together. The advertised pickles were also MIA. -Tortilla Espanola. Another pan-cultural item. A homey omelet of fluffy eggs, potatoes and onions. Get it with blood sausage for an extra savory bite.-Coquilles St. Jacques. Bay scallops and razor clam bits nestled in a fantastic creamy gruyere sauce. Small portion. The MIL almost squealed liked a twelve year old at Bieber concert upon catching this on the menu. -Egg souffle. M. Wells takes on Korean steamed eggs. Made with a mushroom broth with good umami flavor. Finished off with bonito flakes, scallions and seaweed in a cast-iron crock, the overall effect is dramatic. This was okay but I prefer the Asian version. It's lighter and softer.-Ceasar salad. I have a new favorite ceasar salad. Crunchy romaine leaves gussied up in a tasty, smoked herring dressing under a cloud of parmesan. Cheese poofy croutons add to the pleasure.-Beef lamb burger. Wow. This is a mouthful of awesome. A hefty patty sports a beautiful charred crust yet remains moist and juicy after the first bite. Rich flavour, slightly gamey. A schmear of harissa mayo and pickled carrot slices round out this hit parade of textures and flavours.If the server asks you if that is all, your likely instinct is to give up and utter: 'ça suffit!' But their banana cream pie is luscious and the coffee strong....I've been here a few times already and in doing so, I've had to postpone my New Year's resolutions.

But chances are James Bond won't be here because he was only in New York City once. In 1973. I fact-checked it.Whether global espionage is on your agenda or not, this place is a party. Dinner at The Establishment Formerly Known As Bagatelle starts out like any other night at a high-end Meatpacking restaurant - the constant murmur of clever conversation, the clinking of champagne flutes, the slinky dresses hanging off waif-like, scarecrow-esque females, the exposed legs stemming from high-ass stilettos, the flashy suits entertaining their parties, and the cougars at the bar locking eyes with the well-dressed pieces of meat that walk through the doors. Mind you, this is merely the pre-game, the calm before the storm. But you can hear the main event coming like a freight train from miles away - a slow, deafening crescendo, a Doppler Effect that arrives but never seems to pass.Oh wait. You came here for the food? Truth be told, the off-menu Gnocchi a la Parisienne is some of the smallest of its kind I've ever had, but they will melt in your mouth like cotton candy. The Cote de Boeuf (natural-fed grilled rib-eye steak) is both tender and flavorful, but make sure you order it to your liking, otherwise the French kitchen will cook this sucker well done.

This has happened. Also, don't be surprised if there is some maniac girl in a skin-tight dress shakin' it atop the table next to you, her choice of accessory for the night being ski goggles.

Somehow, it earned a legit terminal in South Station and enabled online ticket sales to spare people the medieval auction atmosphere of the ticket booth that used to be tucked in a corner of said alleyway.The company must have done well, because they jacked up their prices to $15 per way, and there the fare has plateaued, hopefully for good! After moving to New York, I was quite taken with Megabus because of their $1 prices for those who plan ahead. Predictably, though, these prices soon became more and more rare, and the lines outside Penn Station turned into a total shitshow.

These wontons will probably give you indigestion, heartburn, higher cholesterol, but they taste so good. Think about it - fried dough and meat, in a rich sauce of peanut butter and hot sauce/oil. Okay - it tastes a lot better than it sounds. I don't know why it is amazing, it is one of those dishes that serendipitously work out. You know kind of like, fried ice cream - how do they do that?? Culinary magic. Anyways, expect a great contrast in flavors - creamy peanut butter, crispy friedness, and a spicy kick. Look for it on the menu under appetizers, I believe it is no. 7 and it is in red font. I also ordered the Shanghai Noodles, these were pretty good. Noodles were cut short to ensure that there were no danglers after you slurped up half the noodle. The sauce was all there - that is, the noodles were pretty brown (they start out tan colored). There were shreds of pork and some bok choy. Basically, it was made the way it should be. This place is tiny. They have, at most, nine tables. They only have two servers that double as cashiers. The wait for food is probably longer than one would expect, but I was oblivious to this fact since I was busy chilling with some old friends.

Let's open a cozy Italian wine bar, serve food at long wooden tables like mama used to have, and decorate it with white pillar candles in paper bags.""Replied the other, ""No no no, I think we should open a bar dedicated to the Prohibition era! We can have brown cocktail menus burned around the edges to make them look authentic, wear suspenders and cool hats, and become experts at making sidecars.""Protested the first, ""But in my vision, there are cured meats hanging in the open kitchen, piles of ripe tomatoes in baskets, and long lists of special wines! We need exposed brick and wooden beams! And we must serve lasagna.""Said his partner, ""Well... I suppose we can combine the two.

1239,25,44,4.0,"Someone should warn you that you coming here is taking a step into a new world of hotness, sweat and lots of nearly naked bodies. The pictures on the website cannot prepare you for this experience. It was hot, raw, steamy, yet oddly PG-13. I had never been to a bath house and it sounded like a good idea. Originally I was going to go by myself, but thank goodness my friend came along which made the whole experience less scary. We walked into this brownstone and it felt like we were in a old deli that smelled like a gym, except some people were clothed, while others were half-naked eating lunch while watching Sportscenter or Eminem videos.The room is filled with Russian banter and lots of bare chests. Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by Victor who was asking us what massages we want. I had read from another yelper that they try to hustle you into other treatments but we had already planned on getting the infamous platza. We checked in, headed over to the tiny women's locker room. It smelled like a mix of feet, body odor, hairspray and chlorine so definitely bring your own flip flops. There's not much room at all so on a busy weekend, be prepared to be getting butt-naked whilst touching the person next to you. Ladies, bring a bathingsuit and preferably one that covers your ass since the hot room seats can be pretty hot. The day we were there some girl braved the hot rooms in g-string with a thin Rio cut panty on top. It was strange and seriously... Two wrongs don't make a right in this or any case.So we were led downstairs to the hot rooms to relax and get ready for our massages. It really wasn't all that relaxing since it was crowded and ridiculously hot. We braved the first hot room for like 10 minutes then headed over to massages. Victor initially tried to have us go in separately but we were intent on going together not really knowing what to expect. Eventually after some pleading and telling us ""I am only one man, I can only do you (wink wink) one at a time"", he found Igor so we could get our platzas together. Ok here's where we went from ""Whoa this place is pretty strange, to where the f are we and what did we get ourselves into?"" They led us into the Radiant heat room which I had misread as the Radiation room and was a little terrified. It was a dark, 200 degree cave with people all around and big rocks. People were dumping buckets of ice water on themselves like they had just won the Superbowl since it was ridiculously hot. And frankly, I was scared. I laid down on this wet hot pad and Igor placed an ice cold towel across my face which was relief from the heat but also a big blindfold to the crazy world. Igor immediately went to work. This wasn't a relaxing massage. It was intense to the max. He was sloshing around soapy water and beating us with wound up oak leaves which felt surprisingly good. The massage was incredible. Igor is a strong man and man does he have good hands. At one point, he was stretching me out better than any trainer I have ever had. He also massaged and scrubbed around ALL OVER my body. I really felt like we should've had dinner or something before hand.... or at least a cigarette after. It was INTENSE! Just when it got like too hot, literally too hot temperature-wise when my legs felt like they were on fire, he'd dump a bucket of ice water on me. He had good timing like that.I should note that these massages are a spectator sport. There's steps with people in the room, usually watching you. I let out a couple screams when I had ice water dumped on me and I definitely heard some laughs but no biggie. It's definitely something you should try and I would highly recommend Igor and would go back to him specifically! The rest of our stay there was interesting. The cold pool is super cold and feels refreshing after being in the radiation room for minutes or seconds at a time. It reeks of chlorine/bleach so I didn't stay in long. The aromatherapy room smells like an Aveda salon gone crazy and gets super foggy where you almost can't breathe. The redwood sauna was my favorite room since it was actually relaxing.All in all, great experience and would go back. Definitely some unique people in this place. Tips:1. Bring your own flips flops and bathingsuit.2. Eat at the deli for sure. Ask the ladies behind the counter what's fresh and they will dish out some Russian deliciousness.3. Definitely request Igor if you can for a platza.4. Don't bother pre-watching a platza treatment before you get one. It'll scare you, so just go with it. It feels pretty awesome.5. Bring water and don't forget to hydrate. There was a guy in there talking to himself who looked like he'd been in there for 3 years straight. Hydrate!",42,0.999

Beautiful, low lit space, with cute booths and a few different enclaves with tiny tables and/or couches. I came here with an interior designer who wouldn't stop gushing about the space. Matty Gee (Milk & Honey, Boom Boom Room) and Niko (GoldBar) take charge at the mostly ""Dialogue Based"" bar. Have a conversation about your spirit of choice/flavors you like, and whether you'd like something refreshing or boozy. They will take it from there. The guys are fun, and the Cocktails are well executed enough as befitting a proper fresh ingredient bar. The one downside is, many of the drinks are sort of the same strategy: booze muddled with a lot of fresh fruit.I love that they have a full kitchen, always a huge plus in my book. Michael Camplin from Boqueria runs the show in back. Items like Braised Short Rib Sliders, Crispy Porkbelly, Mackeral Crudo and Seared Scallops are always going to get my attention at a proper cocktail bar.

1241,16,6,4.0,"Mombar's menu is different from many of the other Egyptian places on Steinway. Don't come searching for kebabs or falafels: Mombar is not a fast food restaurant. It's more about slow, home-cooked food. House recommendations will be made, as if you are dining at the restaurant proprietor's home. Prices will be overlooked. You will be taken care of.A sampling of spreads, stews and meats was a nice way to get acquainted with the Mombar experience. Talapia tagine was my favorite dish: imagine white fish, slow cooked on a clay skillet with a triage of summer vegetables -- yellow squash, green peppers, red tomatoes and garlic. It had a faint sweet and tangy taste, similar to a French ratatouille. Side of couscous was also sexed up with desert thyme, sea salt and sesame seeds. Duck in molasses exercised restraint in its sweetness. I found the dish to be pleasantly balanced -- a bit saccharine, but not too much to overpower the dense taste of the duck. Stewed okra on the side was a nice creamy and salty accompaniment. All of the dishes struck a balance in their contrasting flavors, and that balance was subtle. Some reviews coin the food as being lacking in flavor, but the flavor is there; it's just more subdued.The apps and the desserts were also delicious, albeit pretty standard. Doughy Egyptian bread with an olive oil and sesame dip; mezze platter with fresh pitas and a trio of baba ganoush, hummus and foul; dessert plate of baklava and a side of Egyptian coffee laced with cardamon.The menu has got hints of magic in it. The rest of the Mombar experience is a mixed bag. The prices do exceed the $15-per-entree-mark, although I feel that the quality is worth it. The setting is dark, yet cozy; not airy, but more than compensated by the homemade art on the walls. No drinks menu, but it's BYOB, which is better in my opinion. Service is humble and hospitable.

I love the adobe-esque walls and decor - something about it just makes me want to sit back, relax and enjoy my meal for awhile.And with so many items on the menu to choose from, it's easy to do. I'm a fan of the crab quesadilla - it's a huge portion with big chunks of crab you can see and taste. My husband is a glutton for their ""shepard's pie"", which is really more like a glorified mac & cheese with ground beef and pork. It's ridiculously rich, cheesy and filling - we usually order it as an appetizer and share, but never even finish it. I can only take a few bites before my belly feels laden with meat and cheese. Mmm meat and cheese.Mojave is a really convenient date-night spot for me and my husband, for when we don't want to travel too far but still want to have some good eats.

Girls dressed like they were in a nightclub, guys spraying bottles of champagne all over the attendees, people dancing on tables while a DJ blared music - this was not what I had been led to believe ""brunch"" was. But needless to say, when the opportunity arose for me to attend another famously drunken brunch (now that I live here), I jumped at the opportunity. Enter the Sunburnt Cow. We arrive just at the start of the two hour brunch madness, knowing some, but definitely not all, of what was in store for us. $19 dollars each, and we're in, ordering up our brunch items, and being handed our first (of many) booze-filled glasses.

Going in, I wasn't actually 100% certain how the American interpretation of this particular cuisine would manifest itself, but was taken aback by the scrumptuousness. Was I tipsy? Yes. So maybe I had drunk goggles. But for all I know, those banana pancakes with strawberries were the hottest food I have ever laid eyes on. I'm pretty sure we smoked a cigarette in the bathroom. The last thirty minutes of the open bar were just madcap, as far as I know. I swear to God there were some bloody mary chugging competitions. I'm not sure if I joined in, but if my previous life as a frat boy is any guide - probably. The end of this story is that I showed up at home in the early afternoon, absolutely plastered, to find my roommate and her friends trying on dresses. I am sweaty. I am hammered. I am jolly.

1246,23,12,4.0,"When U Dzika (yelp.com/biz/u-dzika-jac…) closed last year unexpectedly, I was devastated. As a sucker for Polish food and a fan of cheap and abundant offerings, it was definitely a blow. Somehow my prayers were answered when in the fall of last year Zlota Rybka came into the Little Poland scene, offering an impressive spread of Polish goodies via a buffet. And unlike U Dzika, this is an all you can eat buffet.Zlota Rybka, or ""Little Fish"" in Polish, is going to be among the big fish in the Greenpoint when more people find out about it. The restaurant, like many nearby Polish places, is quaint and small but clean. Decor is at a minimum but they've still maintained a nice interior, like that of it's predecessor, Damis (yelp.com/biz/damis-brook…).The service is outstanding. They're friendly, attentive, and polite. I've seen them go out of their way to educate the non-Polish savy, breaking down the nuances of Polish cuisine and helping them understand what they're eating. These ladies are quick to refill waters and swoop up plates, all while doing it with a smile.My expectations were pretty low for a sub $10 buffet, but I was pleasantly surprised with the variety. Most of what people know of Polish cuisine is probably here: stuffed cabbage, pierogies, kielbasas, zurek, koldony, goulash and it goes on and on. I managed to sample a few helpings and raved about each one. My favorites, however, were definitely the potato pierogies, stuffed cabbage, Polish meatballs, and kitzka (roasted sausage stuffed with potato). Most everything has tasted fresh, which is not often said for most buffets.The buffet was $8.95 a few months ago, but it seems the price is now $9.95. To justify the price, the buffet seems larger to me the second time around, with a bit more stuff than before (mainly soups). Takeout is available for $5 per Ib and I'm not sure if delivery is an option. This place is definitely worth trying for the most Polish centric eaters and especially the most novice. It's ideal to come here during lunch time and easy to sample a lot of different stuff without having to stuff your face off (though that's not a bad idea either).

I got served right away, though I did get a good look around. As expected, the place is very polished and has pretty good variety although it skews more to the artisan bakery side than the old school Italian bakery side (although the favorite items from the latter are still present). I ended up getting a fresh sfogliatelle, coffee, and a half pound of their small sesamee cookies (AWESOME that they have 2 sizes). Staff didn't seem thrilled to be measuring half a pound of cookies at 8am, but they saw by my look that I wasn't going to take any BS. The coffee was good quality, and the sfogliatelle was great. The crunchy exterior had a nice butteriness when you bit into it. The inside was nice and soft, but it did lack a bit of flavor surprisingly. The sesamee cookies were up there with the best I've had. They had a bit of sugar in the batter but not too much, were slightly burnt, and avoided being too bready or crunchy. In other words folks, we have a miracle. Its actually lives up to the hype.

I felt all flushed with fever, like Lauryn Hill circa 1996, or some old dude circa 1971. I sweated, shopped, and crash-dieted, and when the big day arrived, I was so anxious that I failed to hail a cab, got caught in the rain, and arrived to Blaue Gans (understudy to Gutenbrunner's better-known Wallsé) a late, bedraggled bundle of nerves.

Put yourself through a grueling workout? Okay! Time for a Sicilian Kit Kat break! At least that's how things work in my skewed worldview.Upon entering the Bensonhurst bakery, you'll find yourself in a psychedelic wonderland that would make Liberace proud in terms of excess and color. Gleaming glass cases house an eye popping array of sweets-cakes, cookies and pastries, oh my! It's a sugar rush of epic proportions, a diabetics worst nightmare. Marzipan shaped fruits and structures resemble refrigerator magnets that look so pretty you almost feel guilty consuming them. Cakes are festooned with elaborate flowers, ribbons, towers..whatever the occasion dictates. In this light, Le Pain Quotidien seems positively staid compared to Villabate's sweet technicolor magic. The shop reminds me of the ""Pasticceria Gelateria"" I labored in for a couple summers during college. Huge variety, long on tradition. If I linger long enough here, I'm transported to those hectic lunch hours when the fellas from the Italian hardware store would drop in for a quick espresso, affectionately calling me 'chino' during the process. However, Villabate's sweets are better made than my former employer though there are a few pits in the lineup. A black forest cake I ordered for my birthday this year was far too sweet and cried out for some kirsch and extra cherries in the filling. Cookies are beautiful and tasty but have been stale on occasion. Their gelato is delicious and features unique Italian flavors but I'm not convinced that it's the best I've tasted. What really rocks my boat, like the other patrons, are the pastries. Their canoli are a mouth-watering, indulgent treat. I'd happily endure the vocal stylings of William Hung and Ricky Martin if I could scarf this confection at the close. The canoli though prefilled, holds its crunchy, fresh texture. They nailed the filling too, a creamy smooth ricotta mix laced perhaps with marscapone and embellished with a couple of chocolate chips and candied fruit on each end. Ladies, this IS worth the damage to your thighs! Similarly, Sfogliatelle is worth learning to pronounce properly so you can procure a bite of the warm multi-layered cone. It's like buttah, and the ricotta filling is heavenly and lightly perfumed with orange. If you want more excess, consider the lobster tail-it's like the sfogliatelle ramped up with a richer filling and dusted heavily with powdered sugar. I could eat a canoli and sfogliatelle from here for breakfast and not bat an eye at the added calories. The ricotta cheesecake is also nice, light and fluffy contending very much with Veniero's version but some would argue there is no contest!Service is quick, verging on brusque at times though the staff will offer suggestions or advice when asked. And I wish they had a proper seating area so patrons could enjoy their pastries inside. Anyways, most everything is good here. If you need further proof of this besides my gluttonous word, come down here during the holidays.

The Wango Tango Jumbo BBQ Chicken Wings were dripping with tangy flavor, even if they were a bit too jumbo for my liking. The Fried Green Tomatoes, topped with Pecorino Romano cheese and served with a cayenne buttermilk ranch dressing, were crazy, off-the-charts delicious.

Whenever I leave New York, it's a vacation. So I go BIG. After riding a bus all day and only eating pretzels, I disembarked in Beantown and went straight to a bar. And then another. And then another. And then another until it all blurred together. I became SO inebriated that later, when we went to get pizza, just the thought of having to handle a slice was enough to turn me off from ordering one. So I went home, wasties, my stomach on E for empty.I think you can guess what happened the next day: I puked my guts out. I felt sick all day. I hated my life. I cursed my poor decision making.However, because I never really learn from my mistakes, I went out again the same night.* I went to a bar. And then another. And then another. And then another until it all blurred together.But this time! This time I ordered a slice of pizza. I ate its cheesy goodness with delight. I went home, wasties, my stomach on F for full.The next day? I felt amazing. As if I was Helen Keller and pizza was my miracle worker.**This is a long way of saying: Pizza Park is my new go-to place when I want drunk pizza on my way home. Their pizza is delicious--if a little pricey depending on what kind of slice you're getting. I've gone pretty late at night before, when their selection is less than stellar. I got a garlic knot to make up for the lousy cheese slice I was getting, and you know what? They gave me another one . . . fo' FREE!Bless you, PP. I've woken up sober so many times because of you. It's a weird feeling I'm getting used to.__________* See? Poor decision making skills.** Is that right?",15,0.7894

Carlos and I split the burger and the mac and cheese, mom & little unlucky both ordered the burger, and my father ordered the half chicken over mashed potatoes with pan juice. I was VERY happy with the mac and cheese. Radiatore is such a good vehicle for this dish. My mom liked it too. After dinner I realized I should have just given her the whole bowl because it was Mother's Day. But I was positively high from the calories and richness, and did not think straight. I ordered the burger medium, much to the boyfriend's chagrin. It came to our table well. I was pretty pissed off about that, but it was still a good burger. I am kind of picky about these things. Maybe I'll try it again another time and order it medium rare. The cheddar and bacon that topped off the burger were awesome, and the whole thing was a, pleasant greasy mess. The fries were also out of this world. I'd definitely come back to try one of the special entrees. They were featuring some pastas that looked magnificent, including a pea canneloni.

That being the case, the drinks are actual designer cocktails that are carefully made and blended, not well mixed drinks. Over $10 in Brooklyn for a vodka cran would shock the mind. For a Jalapeno infused tequila cocktail, with some peppers in it, that has my attention. And it was good. Commonsensical tip, they are good bartenders and what they sell isnt limited to the drink menu. I once went in and they made some drinks with eggs and it was actually good.

1261,13,9,4.0,"Who knew such a cuisine existed?Qingdao food doesn't fit neatly into the four main schools of Chinese cooking. It's not really spicy like Sichuan or Hunan food. Naw, well maybe except for the Qingdao chilled noodles with vinegar, garlic and a secret kick of chili. And its not really sweet like Cantonese food. Well, except for the stewed tofu with mushrooms. It's not terribly sour, except that everything seems to have a cut of vinegar offsetting any taste of soy sauce. And it's not supposed to be that salty, although the abundance of pickling seems to contradict.M&T Restaurant serves up a unique/bizarre mix of regional Chinese food, and the experience is definitely one to be had. All of the dishes were super weird and super good. Case in point: chilled fatty pork with vinegar, garlic and ginger sprinkled on top. Sounds weird, but imagine the saltiness of the pork, melting with the fatty bits, all cut by the acidity and kick of the vinegar/garlic. Perhaps one of my favorite dishes.The Qingdao noodles (or ""pasta"" as listed on the foreigner-friendly picture menu on the wall) were chilled and opaque, served in a vinegary brine, with a very neutral and refreshing taste. I was told by my Chinese friend and dining partner that seaweed was used in some form to season the dish. It tasted as fresh as a walk by the beach (Qingdao is by the ocean after all). Only con was that the vinegar and raw garlic was a bit overpowering for me (and my breath still reaks because of it).Dried tofu with Qingdao mushrooms were simple but had a real ""tebie weidao"" or particular flavor as they say in Mandarin. The featured mushrooms are rare in the States and when combined with a bit of soy sauce and oil, they bring out an amazing woody flavor.Sauteed squid with jiucai (garlic shoots) marked a land-meets-water dish. The garlic shoots were woody, almost as if they had been freshly picked from some Flushing garden (doubtful!), while the little squids were so soft and tender that one could discern little hints of their salt water origins.The pickled starters sound boring but were actually an amazing accompaniment -- particularly when paired with a tall bottle of Qingdao beer. Light, refreshing beer combined with pickled celery and peanuts, generous crunchy bits of lotus roots, and strips of cucumber. Perfect to pick at.I am a fan of M & T, despite my fear that all of the blog coverage will spoil it. Go now while you can. [To be fair, I do read blogs, so I shouldn't knock them. In fact, I wouldn't have known about M & T if I didn't stalk Jeff O's blog and read Judy K's reviews. Thanks guys! You've done it again.]A few logistical tips: come with a big group so you can sample all of the odd dishes. Other things I would have liked to try include the spicy lamb with cumin (Xinjiang style) and the pork face and cucumber salad. Oh well, perhaps next time.Also, beware that it is a schlep from the Flushing-Main St subway.

Alas, a big ribs and beer lunch was out of the question, so I decided to go for a simple sandwich. I went with the lean beef brisket on a soft brioche bun. Came with pickles and a sesame vinegar based cole slaw. Slathered on some of their sweet BBQ sauce and joy was had.

Instead, assessments should be made while keeping in mind that you get what you pay for. And that is why Synergy gets four stars from me. It's simply not fair to compare this fitness club to Equinox or the Health and Racquet Club. They exist in totally different spectrums of the fitness world. In fact, Synergy isn't even trying to compete with them. Instead, it's going after people like me -- people who want to stay fit but don't care that much about spacious locker rooms and the latest, most modern equipment. And most importantly, they're going after people who don't want to spend a lot of money on a gym. For us, Synergy is great. A short walk from my place, Synergy provides me with enough cardio options so that I don't have to wait, enough equipment to keep my body in peak condition (I'm a MACHINE!), and enough cash left over in my pocket to replace those burned calories with burgers and beers. After all, it's only $39 a month! All of the employees I have encountered have been plenty friendly, though I'm sure part of that was an attempt to get me to transfer my trial membership into a permanent one.

Myanmar Fish Broth Noodle Soup with Vegetables -$4.50 3. Myanmar Fish Broth Noodles Soup with Fish- $5.00This is my first time trying mohinga so I got the simple fish broth noodle soup with rice vermicelli ($4).The broth was slightly spicy and flavorful; it was light on chili and light on cilantro; I prefer more spice. The Kyaw (yellow spit pea crackers) added a nice texture to the soft rice vermicelli and the sliced hard-broiled egg is a nice touch. At $4 for a large bowl of soup on a cold day is delightful.

I don't really enjoying thinking weeks in advance whether or not I will be hungry for something as common as a steak, and I certainly don't want to be told what to order either. No, for me, the Palm Tribeca is where it is at. At the Palm they easily accommodate walk-ins though we made reservations just to be sure. The atmosphere is decidedly relaxed, helped considerably by drawings of celebrities and politicians along all of the walls. The service is friendly and inviting too. I am pleased to report though that while the dining environment is casual, the food standards are not compromised in the least. I opted for a porterhouse steak and a side of three cheese potatoes. The porterhouse weighed in at a commanding 28 ounces and was about 1000 calories all by itself. This was aged, prime grade meat prepared perfectly at medium rare, and it was absolutely delicious! I was so pleased that they cooked it properly; often with bone-in steaks, there can be considerable variation in doneness throughout the steak, but that was definitely not the case here. The steak was so tender and really was a delight to eat. The potatoes were served family style, which was a treat for my girlfriend and I to work through. The potatoes were tender and the cheeses came together well -- another delight, since often multiple cheeses can just amount to clunky mounds of salty fat. Here, I really enjoyed the creaminess of the dish.To drink, I was pleased that they had an extensive number of nice selections of wine by the glass. I opted for a Super Tuscan that held up well to the demands of the porterhouse. Better yet, they offered it in quartino size, which was perfect for pairing purposes. After the main course, I opted to sit out dessert and just have coffee, given the substantial size of my dinner. However, my girlfriend was taking advantage of a 4-course special that included an appetizer and dessert. Apparently the staff didn't want me to sit alone while my girlfriend ate her dessert, so they brought me out a slice of cheesecake on the house. Wow! I was really impressed by this gesture. Mind you, this was no sliver of cheesecake. What was presented to me was a mammoth slice sitting atop a strawberry drizzle with fresh schlag, made in-house, served on the side. Delectable and wonderful! It was such a pity that I could not finish it -- literally, too much food in all!The general manager was kind enough to pay his respects at our table and ask us if we enjoyed everything -- we did.

I certainly would not have labeled the uptown end of the 3 train, up in Harlem, as such a neighborhood. Indeed, Charles' Country Pan Fried Chicken is comically far from any other point of interest to me (except Highbridge Park). But who needs another point of interest? This is fried chicken we're talking about.It's set up as the star of an all-you-can-eat buffet, lying in a set of warming trays that are meant to be used for both eating in and takeout. I noted to my disappointment that when I walked in, it wasn't quite fresh chicken, but I was on a schedule and didn't have time to wait for a new batch. I ponied up my $15, picked up a styrofoam plate, and began.The collard greens had that wetness I love about soul-food preparations of them and were tasty enough, though not spectacular. Sweet potatoes were much the same. The mac and cheese, however, was revelatory. Charles Gabriel could singlehandedly put S'mac and Macbar out of business if he served just his mac and cheese out of a cart or something downtown.As for the chicken, in the name of research, I took no fewer than four pieces. For not-quite-fresh fried chicken, it was shockingly moist. In fact, it took me a surprisingly long time to realize that my first bites were from a breast piece -- it had that wet mouth feel that I associate with dark meat. The crust was crisp and thin in a lovely way. I have to admit, I was disappointed that I wasn't eating it straight from the pan, but it was definitely credible fried chicken.And then a new batch came out.By this time, I'd almost finished the four pieces, as well as a piece of baked chicken, not to mention the three generous portions of sides I mentioned above (well, four really, because my serving of mac and cheese was huge). But it looked to be the man himself, Mr. Gabriel, tonging the fresh, glistening fried chicken into the warming trays. I couldn't resist. I got a drumstick. I took a bite.Cutting Crew immediately started playing in my head. You know: ""OH! I just died in your arms tonight...!""I don't even know how to describe it. It reached that rarefied category of foods that I must keep eating even as they physically hurt me with plasma-hot temperatures.

It was also wonderful.Finally, I left, and whatever strings of enchantment that had held me were snapped: I was suddenly disgustingly full. I couldn't breathe. Was it my enormously distended stomach pressing up against my diaphragm? Had my blood's oxygen carrying capacity been diminished by all the fatty chyle suspended in my circulation? Whatever it was, the phrase ""hurts so GOOD"" jumped to mind. Then, an existential moment of crisis: what was I doing to myself? Questing into unfamiliar neighborhoods just to binge eat ridiculously unhealthy food... Was this what I wanted to be doing with my life?Then the moment passed.You know that scene in ""Precious"" where the heroine steals an entire bucket of fried chicken for herself? I remember being pretty sickened at the idea of one person finishing off an entire bucket. Well, I came perilously close to doing just that at Mr. Gabriel's joint. It would have been revolting...

When the tomato soup (that's right... good ol' tomato soup) arrived at our table, we all dug in, hoping just to steal some of the warmth for our shivering bodies. What happened in our mouths was unbelievable. I think my taste buds must have gone into shock because that was honestly the BEST TOMATO SOUP I have ever had in my life.

1270,33,64,4.0,"With tax, admission here at the Museum of Doin' It clocks in at nearly $20, which is a bit steep when you consider the fact that I already know how to do it. But it turns out this place isn't just about teaching people how to do it (or, it turns out, not really about that at all), but also about the history of doing it, the changing nature of how doing it has been captured on film, and also about how animals do it and stuff. For instance, did you know that dolphins sometimes do it in the blowhole? That shit is hilarious.The first floor exhibits were kind of a wash, and made me miss that $20 in my wallet a little. It's just a series of paragraphs written on the wall about how sex has been captured/alluded to in film, from pretty much the invention of moving pictures onward, with accompanying, almost random, looping video clips, ranging from obscure black-and-white spanking movies to one of Pam Anderson's sex tapes. So basically it's a mash-up of the Wikipedia/YouTube searches of a random 12-year-old boy. Not exactly $20 well-spent so far.On the second floor, however, business starts picking up. Besides the section on STDs that features way too many graphic, close-up pictures of syphilis-infected genitalia for me to hurry past, nearly everything here is interesting in some way--Tijuana Bibles of Popeye/Blondie characters, real examples of uh, Real Dolls that indeed show that they're a colossally creepy waste of money, and neat old tins that condoms used to come in. And if there is anything funnier than old-timey writing about sex, I have yet to find it. I mean, if you don't find Olde English instructions on how to use/maintain a reusable condom entirely entertaining and engrossing, you life could stand some changes.But oh, the third floor is where it's at. This is the floor exclusively devoted to exhibits about animals doing it, and it is equally informative and hilarious, while simultaneously giving me an entirely new scale to feel inadequate against. Again, this probably isn't anything you couldn't look up on the Internet yourself, but better to study it here all in one place, in a professional, academic environment, rather than sullying your computer with just about the worst Google search history ever. I don't want to spoil too much, but some of my favorite facts learned here:-Monkeys will trade sugarcane for sex-Elephants will jerk each other off with their trunks-A dolphin failed to clear a training hurdle and got stuck there, and then discovered that repeatedly trying to jostle itself off the hurdle felt really, really good, which led to it eventually trying to fuck all of its toys and training equipment-A duck will chase another duck all morning trying to rape it, and if the pursued duck happens to die before it gets caught, well, that doesn't necessarily mean it's not still gon' get raped.Man, animal sex: it gets no funnier. Thank you, Museum of Sex, for helping me learn more about sex than I ever wanted to know, and to laugh about it even more than I already do.

This is mild Indian food. It's also a hit or miss from what I've gathered. Delhi Heights was my first official meal in Jackson Heights as a resident. Some neighbors bring you a basket of goodies as part of the welcome wagon, other neighbors bring you to an Indian lunch buffet. I'm glad I'm neighbors with the latter. My first meal at Delhi Heights was a bit more on the spicy end. This time the spice was pretty much non-existent. I've heard at times their food is salty and at other times really bland. So you never know what you're going to get but so far I've liked it. Delhi Heights is a good place to take guests. It's considered fancy for the area with nice plates, silverware, flooring, and a renovation that can't be beat. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. When we asked about the chutneys, instead of making us get it ourselves from the bottle at the buffet table, they brought them out to us in dishes. They also kept encouraging us to eat more because there was plenty of food available. If you are well versed in the art of buffet and all you can eat, then you can do very well here. At a mere $9.95, you can really pack away a lot of punch for your dollar. They will also give you more naan than you could ever hope for. Drinks are a separate charge so be careful. A lassi costs about half of your meal.I barely know the names of Indian dishes. I was glad to find that this time they marked the buffet. I would say on average there are about 10 dishes available. Dishes vary by day but there are always the staples. I gorged on veggie pakodas, chicken tandoori, chicken makhani, goat curry, palak paneer, mixed vegetables, chickpea salad, and chicken biryani. My absolute favorite is the goat curry. I could eat that all day long. It's not gamey whatsoever, the curry is mild, and the meat is very tender. For dessert, they have moong daal halwa which is a rich sweet yellow lentil pudding. It has the consistency of polenta and has a hint of almond flavor.

So this year, I decided to avoid the reservations, the expensive night of alcohol and the inevitable look of death the next morning.Instead I took my oldest friend in the world, my mom and her mom to Spa Castle - a magical world of spa pools, sauna's and massages that I have been itching to go to since it first opened in College Point.A 15 min drive from house and voila - we arrived. First impressions - clean, bright and efficient. You pay your $35 (weekday rate), get your electronic ""golden ticket"" and walk through to the locker room.* Everyone gets their own electronic shoe locker and then larger clothing locker. You are also provided with a uniform of sorts (cotton shirt and shorts), towels (if you need it) and a smile. ** Then you exit into the wonderland that is Spa Castle.I soaked. I was pummeled by therapeutic jets of water in a mineral pool. I partook in the Hinoki tub on the roof, which gave the illusion that you were truly in some outdoor garden and not on a rooftop in Queens. I baked in the Gold Plated, Mineral Salt and UV Red Sauna's. I cooled down in the Ice Sauna. My skin felt amazing. I was limp as a noodle*** at the end of it all. We all were in agreement that this was awesome. A perfect way to spend an odd little birthday.Notes:* The women-only locker room does not have private changing areas or showers - be prepared to see women of all shapes and sizes in their birthday suits and for you to have to wander around in yours if you are to partake in the hot and cold pools. It's a great way to lose your inhibitions. Ahem.** You cannot wear your shoes inside the spa, but it was clean enough to walk around barefoot. If you are squeamish - you can buy their slippers for $5. I didn't.*** There is food here - a tad expensive for what it is, but you are a captive audience. And there are no other restaurants in the area. You also don't need your wallet, just scan your locker key at the food areas and pay your bill when you return your key.",32,0.933
1273,30,24,4.0,"I have macrophobia, the fear of long waits. As a New Yorker, this is not a good fear to have, as we deal with interminable waits all the time - Shake Shack, brunch at Prune, the E train, NY state income tax refunds, etc.Casellula is no different - plan for a wait, which can be attributed to a variety of factors. It's small, it's cramped, but it's intimate, with dim ambiance, bright wood tones, and dramatic ceilings. It's also the only restaurant in Hells Kitchen that can compete with the great tapas bars of the Village, NoHo and LES. And finally, the food and wine is good. It's damn good.Typically, we expect no more out of a charcuterie platter than thin bits of meat and cheese, scattered on the plate, garnished perhaps with a few gherkins and olives. Moreover, most restaurants stick with 'safe' cheeses - brie's, port salut's, and edam's are crowd pleasers but not very imaginative. At Casellula, meats and cheeses are artfully plated, and sport an encyclopedic library of cheeses, many of which you've likely never heard of. The food is beautiful. A refreshing mixed green salad, is plated with the skill and precision of a brain surgeon. A dish of creamy burrata is so strikingly beautiful, i'd be happy just gazing at it all night, instead of shamefully shoveling it into my maw.Don't even get me started on the wines. Let's just say that oenophiles are in good hands.I think it's safe to say that Casellula is worth a little wait, phobia or not.

1274,33,27,4.0,"This brightly lit joint was bustling and packed to the gills when I arrived on a weeknight last week. Situated on a rather quiet and dark stretch of Coney Island Ave as well, so allow me to play devil's advocate and think of reasons why one shouldn't bother with this already mad-popular Turkish kebab house: -Distance. For all you outer borough phobists, it's at least a half hour subway ride each way from Manhattan.-The atmosphere and sound level is raucous and lively. On any given night you are likely to find a good mix of Turks, Russians and local families chowing down. It's hard to carry a conversation as I found myself doing my best Lil' Jon impression every third sentence or so. Long narrow tables. Harsh fluorescent lighting. Lineups out the door. Don't bring a date here to impress!-There's no (obviously) pork on the menu. But some of the dishes are so mouth wateringly good they'll make you forget why you dine on swine.-Adding to that, the menu features a simple roster of Turkish kebabs and mezes. No confit this, nothing sous-vide, dishes unadorned of foams, gelees or anything of the like that would send Michelin vultures into a masturbatory frenzy. The restaurant has been a neighborhood favorite for over twenty years, it's no flash in the pan. The bragability factor from dining here is low.BUT! If the following doesn't dissuade you and damn if it doesn't, there's good value here especially if you come in a group. All the families here must be right about something. BYOB keeps your bill low too if you feel like indulging. I recommend bringing a bottle of Raki just for the shock value from the servers here when you ask them to serve it to a group of lightweight Asians. Our group was relatively small but we managed to polish off a good cross-section of the menu. The starters whetted our appetites and helped to hold our ground as we let the intense Raki seep into our systems. The shepherds salad was fresh and bright: chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and onions dressed in a lemony dill dressing. Snowy mountain of shaved feta on top. Sigara boregi arrived next. Cigars of feta and herbs wrapped in filo pastry and fried to a greaseless crunch. Since when is fried cheese bad? Pan fried cubes of calf's liver could serve a case study for all parents trying to get their kids to ingest more iron. Creamy and crispy goodness. Smokey, luscious eggplant dip. Tarator-a refreshing dip from the extended family of tzatziki paired well with our basket of sesame bread and the meats that followed. Of the kebab dishes that we enjoyed, I was most impressed with the iskender kebab. Shaved pieces of spit roasted ground lamb smothered in a mixed sauce of tomato and yogurt over pieces of fried bread. Buttery. Slightly acidic but heavenly. Adana kebab couldn't quite hold a candle to the richness of the iskender but it was satisfying. A couple of juicy brochettes of chopped lamb, it had a nice char and also came with grilled roma tomatoes and sumac dusted onions on the side but that's it. We thought our side order of french fries would be an afterthought here but they were hand-cut and more addictive than they ought to be. Portions needless to say, are generous. Service is fast and the dishes arrive at your table quickly. Maybe too quickly. The servers whiz by at breakneck speed leaving one to flag them down for water or the bill at times. As mentioned earlier, the lighting is harsh and oppressive but thankfully the food here has nothing to hide.",36,0.994

Back in New York I found some solace in newcomer Kajitsu, a shojin ryori (Zen vegan temple food) restaurant nestled in the East Village. Located in an austere and spacious basement, it is distinct Japanese/NYC hybrid yelp.com/biz_photos/fCxQ… We were seated at the (seemingly much too large for our group of three) front window's organically undulating slice of hefty wood, the only bold object in the otherwise restrained dining room, but in this restaurant we are arranged with purpose, and negative spaces becomes a part of the $70 (+$30 Sake pairing) eight course Hana menu experience.My favorite dish of the evening was the ""7 Gems"" Sushi Roll, Plum Nama-Fu, Roasted Nuts yelp.com/biz_photos/fCxQ… The picture cannot express how tiny these dishes were, I felt like a looming monster (and may have pretended to be one) when they were placed before us. My friend called the little pink nama-fu ""The Alien"" after it slipped into her mouth in its entirety as she tried to take a little nibble. Despite this attack, at the end of the meal when we reflected on our favorite dishes, that chubby chewy nama-fu flower was the first thing that came to mind. In the background, a half snowflake of lotus root rested on an otherwise unremarkable vegetable roll. The dollhouse dish of beans and nuts was not eaten in a single amuse-bouche style swoop only because the chopsticks forced us to select and examine each morsel with singular intent. The most dissipointing moment was the deep black lacquered bowl holding a scoop of Steamed Rice with Grilled Turnips served with Crispy Turnip Leaves and House-made Pickles yelp.com/biz_photos/fCxQ… While Japanese pickles are a food I annoyingly obsess over (according to my BF), even I could find little redeeming quality in the muddy offering of mushrooms, eggplant and daikon. The salted dried turnip leaves were the only exciting element of this dish - served whole, leaving to us to crush them in to dull green glitter with our hands... an act filled with all the tactile satisfaction of popping bubble wrap.Our bill plus tip was exactly $400 for 3 people, a somewhat difficult penance to pay for a meal that did not dazzle with every bite - especially considering that the similarly sized vegetarian Omakase menu at Zenkichi is only $48, though not as decadently prepared nor as elegantly served/serviced as Kajitsu.",14,-0.1292

Everyone is well dressed, Burberry jackets are seen hanging by almost every diner's table (did I miss a big sale or something). The bar is always very crowded so if you are thinking of sitting at the bar to relax, don't bother here. There are also mini-tables in back of the bar to sit and enjoy drinks without a bartender trying to engage in small talk aka working for tips. The only problem with the bar tables are when sitting down, you are perfectly aligned with someones butt. Sure the men may have no problem with this, but me? I was aligned with what reminded me of a typical fat guy plumber butt. Needless to say, I never did sit by those tables again... The waiter was super friendly and polite. He didn't even seem disappointed when we didn't order that much (scores points in my book). The food never disappoints here. The hamburger, though pricey at $16, is enjoyable, spring for the extra $1 to get cheese added (the Gruyere is a good match but you could choose from a bunch). The burger comes with fries; skinny, long, and salted to perfection. The macaroni and cheese was also a really good side that I wish I had endless portions of, worth every bit of that $9.

How do I say this without losing my Friend of Dorothy card? I don't . . . really . . . like show tunes. THERE. Are you happy? I'm uncultured. Yet at the same time breaking stereotypes, oh hey!Anyway, I don't know, the Broadway thing just never happened for this little 'mo. Sure, I found my way to the stage a number of times--like any confused outcast--but I avoided musicals. Probably due to my phobia of singing.Yet, there's something about Marie's charm that suggests you should know more tunes. That way, you too can belt your heart out like the drunk girl falling all over the piano. Man, she's having a blast!There are few things I love more than a cheap drink with a heavy pour. The bartenders know how to get you liquored up while pinching pennies. That alone is reason enough for me to go back time and time again. It's also liquid encouragement. Have you ever seen a person naturally-inclined to singing Broadway tunes drunk? It's 10x the crazy!Weekday happy hours (and even weeknights) seem to be less crowded than weekends, so be aware.

I would definitely recommend a side of the fried plantains, they do them very well here, and their empanada appetizer is large and delicious. If youre looking through the drink menus, you may be inclined to get the mojito. But despite the mojito's familiar convenience and minty goodness, I would recommend switching it up and going with the ginger caipirinha. Not the regular one, the ginger one. It's delicious, and you'll definitely be interested in getting a second. Go ahead, try it, and don't hesitate to post back with a compliment after you do :)Pretty much anything on the menu is a winner. I got the paella and it was loaded with lots of delicious seafoods, all done really well, some nicely spiced chorizo, and a delicious piece of tenderly cooked chicken. YL's chimichurri steak was juicy, buttery (in a good buttery steak kind of way) and the chimichurri itself was nice and tangy. The side of yuca mash was exceptional.

I'm totally cutting edge, trendy, kewl, awesome and radical. HOW YOU DOIN!Because Baddies is so ""hip"" on popular going-out nights, I took the space for an early-evening Sunday birthday soiree. Other than securing a credit card for incidentals, I didn't end up paying anything upfront or afterward as we made the event a cash bar - pretty cool! They staffed us with 2 bartenders and a coat check and allowed us to use our own DJ. The staff were extremely accommodating, amiable and laid back.Served in cocktail glasses reminiscent of Fancy Feast commercials in the 90s, the signature cocktails are killer. Who knew tequila, mint and cucumber mixed well? Drinks are moderately priced (around $9-$12). Besides great cocktails, the draw at Baddies is the space itself. Though the space could have easily looked like a grungy restaurant basement, it is spectacularly designed as a veritable 70's coke den.Curio cases with random specimens and amethyst crystals. Trippy red lightbulbs. Mirrors. Iron curtains. Fuzzy rigid couches. Mirrors. Ornate Liquor Cabinets.

I covered Tribeca to the Lower East Side, up and down and sideways across the city until finally coming across a place with the ambiance to fit my mood and tired tootsies. It was the lounge of Le Zie - quietly tucked off the street, candle lit, and softly whispering my name. Actually, I think it whispered something more like ""Enough walking already... you like alcohol and it's inside....."" I snuggled into a bar seat with my name on it, and within seconds was greeted by a sweet bartender. Together, we tackled Hendricks. She poured and shook, I sipped and slurped. Talk about teamwork. I think my only disappointing moment was that she set the mini javelin of olives on her bar mat for a second, but she made it up to me by over pouring. I ordered an appetizer of braised octopus, sundried tomatoes, and chickpeas... tossed in a tapenade or something of the sort ($12). I enjoyed the chickpea concoction with or without the octopus, but can't say the charred octopus had much flavor when flying solo. Alas - perfect portion, served with fresh, yummy bread and olive oil.

1282,14,11,4.0,"LOVE IT!(funny story)So I have a friend in town visiting who loves to try new food, and always likes the ""higher end"" places. I was introducing my friend to another friend here in NY who works with startup companies thinking that they might be able to do business together. I went onto the Yelp mobile app and searched for $$$$/$$$ in the West Village and came up with this place: yelp.com/biz/antica-vene… which looked interesting enough to take him to (he likes Italian). I call the maitre'd and ask him if my friend would enjoy coming there and if I needed a reservation. He said to come by whenever we are ready.We're walking up the west side highway, and the two friends are talking to each other about business, travels, life etc and I see the beautiful decor etc and assume that because I searched $$$$/$$$ and there are not too many restaurants on this street that this must be the place. Not even looking for a sign that says Antica, I walk into Perry Street with the two chatty friends in tow certain that this is Antica (I think it was a Friday night btw) the woman at the front asks if we have a reservation and I tell her that we called and the nice guy on the phone told us to come in and I gave him my name. She looks down at her brightly lit screen and replies, I have no reservation here under that name. I thought it was strange that there was ""no room"" and the entire place was empty. The woman comments on how they get VERY full soon and that she may not be able to accommodate us. Ten minutes later we are seated at a table and enjoying our first round of drinks/appetizers.I was very impressed with the menu options and thought it was odd that an Italian restaurant would have such items, but the decor was amazing, the food looked incredible, and I was happy to be out of the chilly wind and rain.More drinks, sake... ( at no point did it occurred to me that an Italian restaurant would never have sake, hind sight tends to be 20/20).So the waiter spills my friends calamari all over him (as though we are part of a Seinfeld episode) the people next to us seem to be enjoying every course of their ""Italian Meal"" so I ask them which was their favorite course so far and if they were enjoying it. They said ""eh"" and both lit up and raved about the crusted tuna appetizer. We had considered doing a tasting, but after their suggestion, we decided to pass. My friend then spills and entire glass of sake all over himself (yep, right on his pants) because our table is so small it's hard not to knock over a skinny tall champagne glass full of sake (hey seriously not a good idea to have such towering glasses if the table is full and you have too many people at it), but can't complain too, they did seat us without a reservation on a Friday night. Oh and I ordered the filtered sake but they brought unfiltered.Right... so now you're noticing the great star rating and the restaurant's mistakes (1. spilled calamari all over my friends suit, 2. wrong sake, 3. reaaaally small table for three people, 4. less than rave reviews on their tasting menu)So we move onto our food. One of my friends leaves to go to another dinner, and we continue on with our meal.  I had a sashimi appetizer that was pretty good (small portion, minimal flavor, I hope the fish was flown in from Japan, that would merit it's price tag), the Tuna was BY FAR the best item we had all night. Then we move on to the main course. I ordered the skirt steak, again another rare thing to see on an Italian menu, only the skirt steak arrives and it looks like two pieces of filet mignon. For the most part I've never seen a skirt steak cut that thick. Yea, you're going to say - I bet it was ""tough"" well it was. Skirt steak is a mouthful in the first place, but sawing through a thick piece is even tougher. The flavor was good but when you feel like you're chewing on a rubber band and you can't get your teeth to break through, you have to wonder what the chef was thinking when he cut it that way. So, what do I do? Well I want to feel helpful to this nice Italian establishment, and I mention to the waitress when she asked ""how was your food"" that I found it interesting that the chef chose to cut the steak this way. That it was too tough and he should consider slicing it different. She mentioned that there is filet on the menu, but they ran out and reprinted the menus (yes all of the menus the same day) impressive I know. I thought it was incredible for the Italian place to care this much about proper serving and details with coordinated butler style service. Little did I know that I was telling Jean George how to cut his steak. My god - the nerve. *laughs*GREAT decor, delicious food, and lovely things to wet your pants.

I love great finds in NYC!!!!!On my first attempt to eat here, I got slammed. There was a long wait, and despite the fact that I put my name on the requisite list, 45 minutes did not earn me a table. The owner did give me a 10% off card to entice me to return on a less busy night, however, so return I did.We picked a weeknight to dine at Vai. The cuisine is more Mediterranean than Italian (lest I be picky), and the menu is not particularly expansive. There were only a few items I was interested in, but they sounded fantastic. My friend and I opted for the Italian entrees over the seafood/Mediterranean cuisine: I had a pasta dish with warm spinach pesto, which was delicious, while my friend had the mushroom ravioli with ricotta and truffle cream. Both were great, and the portions were perfect.Also noteworthy is the sangria - Vai's own flavor creations include blood orange and blackberry. We chose the blackberry and were very happy with our selection, which comes in carafes as well as glasses. They offer an extensive wine list, but cold sangria is always welcome in the summer heat! Dinner is served with a homemade loaf of bread smothered in olive oil and spices, and you can get more than one loaf fo' free (so sue me, I'm a sucker for warm bread!!). Last but not least, our waiter was funny and personable, made sure we were well-tended to, and our water glasses were never empty. The place never filled up, so we had room to stretch our legs, time to eat slowly, and the opportunity to enjoy our food. Vai lesson learned: do not go on a weekend without a reservation!!!

Because you have to push some weight to get in here.We rolled up in a black SUV with tinted windows driven by a chauffeur. Our party was on the list, but the mafiosi-esque people at the door still gave us a silent once-over before letting us in. The lobby was clean and empty and boring, like that of a luxury apartment building.Into the elevator we went, where the trippiest audio-visual artpiece EVER played on the plasma walls the whole 50-plus floors to the top. I was seriously entranced by this thing - definitely influenced by Dante's Inferno. The elevator emptied us out into another boring hallway at the end of which was a 360 view of New York City through glass so clear I immediately felt adrenaline in my veins.It was Wednesday and we were early, so there were about three other people in the whole place. It started filling up quickly, though, with short, well-dressed, constipated looking men and tall, beautiful, insecure girls with expensive clothes and eating disorders. Everyone was ridiculously young, and I wondered how and why they were all there. The DJ took his place and started bumping great music at a perfect volume...more '90s Jay-Z than Lady Gaga, thank God. Lady Gaga has no place in an establishment like this.A non-anorexic waitress with powerful thighs hazardly exposed by the shortest white dress I have ever seen came up to us and started taking our orders. With wild abandon, the leeches, I mean, friends, around me started commanding $400 bottles of pink Veuve Cliquot to be popped and calling for Grey Goose hand-mixed with fresh cranberry juice, soda water, or orange juice. I was so full from a decadent Italian dinner (also paid for by the gracious semi-royalty who had ferried us into the Boom Boom Room) that I started feeling too sluggish to dance. What a damn shame; everyone else was busy shimmying with bored looks on their faces and striking VOGUE poses by the glass walls and on top of a rose-colored grand piano. The bathroom was the best part...there was a wide-eyed Asian man with a towel literally wiping the whole place down after every single use. He pointed me in and I strode in, and literally jerked back for fear of falling off the building...then I realized that there was glass in front of me. Heart thumping wildly, I scuttled backwards onto the toilet and did my thing, and went back to the safety of my party's lounge.Soon, it was raining like mad outside, and we were treated to a show of lightning. Was it fun? Well, it wasn't not fun. But something about this place - Boogie Nights meets Eyes Wide Shut meets some scene from an unborn James Bond film....something about the social climbing bumpkins secretly thrilled to death at being in a room full of filthy rich people but trying to hide it behind faces of affluent boredom...something about it all fell short of thrilling me. After all, in Seoul or any other Asian city worth its salt, you get this kind of view and service everywhere, and usually for cheaper. Then again, the Boom Boom Room is in the U.S. of A. in the one and only Manhattan...besides, how could I ever complain when someone else threw down a few Gs in one night for my enjoyment?

I've been on a bagel kick lately, and not sure if it's due to the cream cheese, the salmon or WHAT....but i've been hooked. simple as that.  you either care for them or you don't..and right now, bagels got a whole lotta lovin' from moi. Was in the neighborhood and so I stopped to get a whole wheat everything bagel with lox... tomatoes & onions. one point lost automatically for not having red onions. you simply CAN'T eat lox without RED onions...not white, not yellow.....RED!!! Well, that's my philosophy at least...awesome friggin' bagel. better than Murrays... crunchy on the outside and crispy & chewy on the inside. it definitely didn't need to be toasted. it was perfect. the bagel was also nicely seasoned, i'm not sure if it was the sesame or the garlic..something was tossed in salt. it was delicious. scallion cream cheese was very good..however, i think i like the salmon at Murrays better...and all the other fixins. i'm gonna have to do a taste test challenge for myself.. after a few times of eating at both places...i'm pretty sure i'd like the bagels here more though. one thing is true....undeniably GOOD. i had exactly half a portion left and actually toasted it... it actually didn't taste any better! i was shocked. i was really adamant on getting it toasted, but if it's that good, no oven is required.hmm.. now i wonder how much better a non-whole wheat bagel tastes??anyways, i'll be back here for some bagels and their spreads only... charging $12 for a lox bagel is a little astronomical don't you think?!?!",11,0.9536

Sometimes you have to coerce non-whiskey drinkers into drinking the whiskey that comes with their three course meal.This three course meal + booze cost us under 40 bucks (sans tip) thanks to Blackboard Eats, and Char No. 4 did not skimp. It was clear that the promotion was a serious attempt at winning over future customers. Win us over they did. We were early so my party indulged in some Lagunitas and Kelso. Here's a tip: They offer Bulleit and a beer for $10...great bargain. Unfortunately I was almost drunk by the time we arrived, so I opted to wait for the flight. Abstaining from happy hour definitely didn't do me any favors. Once we were seated and served our first course (a sublime chilled soup of green chile, cucumber, avocado, and invisible smoked shrimp. The perfect amount of slow burning kick really made my day), they brought our first round of booze. I don't remember what it was. But it was great. And from that moment on, we started our transformation from a smiley, giggling group to a full on gaggle of laugh gasping, cheekbone hurting, flailing goons. And it was fabulous. Not one drop of soup remained, and the same went for the bourbon. Course # 2 was our entree. I went for the house sausage w/ mustard potato salad and crispy shallots. I appreciated the sausage, and it was well made, but there was somethign that was just not quite to my liking. There is no denying that it is probably a popular dish, but it just was not my style. The potato salad, on the other hand, was fantastic. I'm a big fan of mustard, so it was right up my alley. With this course came a sour mash whiskey. It was perfect. I sampled the sweet potato gnocchi, which was a tad large in my opinion, and I enjoyed its flavors. The hen of the woods were a great touch. For dessert we enjoyed slices of key lime pie topped with homemade marshmallow, over the perfect graham cracker crust. I had almost no room for this, but somehow managed to eat half of my serving. I did, however, have room for the whiskey. Needless to say, I stumbled out of this joint full, happy and quite drunk. Full from the food, happy thanks to the company and the sexy, accommodating service, and drunk from all that fucking alcohol. The logical next move? Well, to another bar of course!",15,0.9979

Now, from the last two reviews I did, you can see, my last two dining experiences in NYC before my departure were sub-par, at best.  We deserved a welcome back meal with style and we weren't sure we were going to get it at Saul but to my pleasant surprise, we got it!We had a 7:30pm Saturday night reservation and when we arrived a little early, we were seated right away. The space was really simple, candlelight, white table clothed tables, brick walls and a small bar towards the back. It was small, but they made great use of the space and it didn't feel cramped, but cozy. We had a nice private table towards the corner of the restaurant. They did offer a $40 prix fixe as well as their tasting menu but we opted to go a la carte. I decided to start off with the Ceviche of Local Albacore Tuna which was a marinade of citrus extra virgin olive oil and micro dice of peppers.  Soon after we placed our orders we were brought some bread and homemade butter followed by a delicious amuse-bouche which was a chilled potato soup flavored with a tangy yet spicy red pepper seasoning and topped with sour cream and chives. DELICIOUS!! We were off to a great start!Our appetizers arrived in no time and what flavor this ceviche had! It wasn't spicy, but the citrus flavors just infused the tuna and there was so much flavor and textures. I was having a ball eating this! Very well done! I could not wait for what the chef had in store for me in my main course. For that, I opted for the hangar steak which came with a potato puree and oxtail stuffed with red peppers. Very shortly after we finished our appetizers, they brought out our entrees. The steak was cooked medium rare to perfection and sliced over the potato puree. I put one slice in my mouth and it melted ever so nicely on my tongue. I usually expect this cut of steak to be a bit on the chewy side but it was not that way at all. This was very nicely done and I enjoyed every bite! Next thing I knew, I had cleared my plate. I am not a fan of oxtail, but I did taste some of it and it was very flavorful and the red pepper slices stuffed in between the meat and bone of it was a nice touch. We did not get dessert, however we did get some French-pressed coffee which was fantastic and made for a perfect finish to a wonderful meal. The service, food and ambiance made this a perfect choice for a nice, romantic evening in Brooklyn and also for our first nice meal upon coming back from vacation. I was really not expecting much since the menu items didn't seem to blow me away, but the creativity and flavor of the dishes really did. I would definitely recommend giving Saul a try.",15,0.9988

You can order the rolls 1 of 2 ways: 1) Maine Style (cold w/light mayo) 2) Connecticut Style (warm w/drizzled butter). The Maine Style is very refreshing and light...a good unexpected surprise. The Connecticut Style is a bit heavier most likely because of the butter and for some reason made me feel very lethargic after consuming the roll. I would recommend the OG style - Maine.Each roll goes for a solid $15 and in my opinion is worth every penny.Also, right when you walk in there are 2 HUGE tubs filled with lobster that you can taunt.

To find it, just follow the scent of beef bouillon broth, scallions, soy sauce and star anise, which is kinda like Beijing in a bottle. I mean seriously! Lao Bei Fang has cracked the code in reproducing the faint smell that permeates the capital of the People's Republic. It's a distinctive ""Chinese-Chinese food"" smell, one that breathes authenticity. Pungent. Soy. Sweet. Anise. Delicious.But enough about smells.The beef noodle soup is amazingly simple, with a rich broth, tender slices of fatty meat, and hand-pulled Lanzhou style noodles. For less than $5 for a huge bowl, it's an experience that no one should forgo.The namesake dumplings themselves do not disappoint. $1.25 for 4! Medium doughy-ness, fried to a crisp on one side, soft and chewy all the way through, with the most amazing pork/chive filling inside. In my quietest of moments, I sometimes ponder the perfection that is Lao Bei Fang dumplings. How do they get them to be so good? The balance of crunch and chewiness. The saltiness of the pork, with the onion flavor of the scallions. All contrasted with the vinegar, soy sauce and chili dipping sauces. Yeah, they're THAT good.Food aside: the entire experience of eating in inside what is no more than a dirty take-out window is quite fun, if you come with an adventurous attitude.

It seems that business and ""power"" dinners always take place at a steakhouse. Due to the near-extinction of Wall Street power lunches and corporate accounts, Delmonico's must stand out in terms of the high-quality service offered and food prepared. To be honest, I've never been impressed with midtown and downtown steakhouses - the food isn't very good and it is very much a ""boys club."" Delmonico's is no exception in the atmosphere department. It was extremely evident that this is where the movers and shakers of Wall Street closed deals. It was also evident that those times are long gone; the markets unraveled, and our team was seated in a mostly-vacant restaurant. Even more ironic, the team dined at Delmonico's the same week the Wall Street sequel came out.As an appetizer, I ordered the scallops in sweet corn pudding. The scallops were juicy and not gritty. As a main course, I ordered the angry red snapper. Not sure what makes snapper so angry - credit default swaps perhaps? (Bad joke, sorry!) It was a large portion, albeit a bit salty, and the spaghetti squash that came as a side was super-buttery. For dessert, I ordered the baked alaska, one of Delmonico's signature dishes. Although the contrast in temperatures was not pronounced, I enjoyed the contrast in textures (whipped, porous, creamy, and spongy) and consistencies (light and airy, heavy and rich).In summary, Delmonicos was surprisingly good for a steakhouse; exceeding my fairly low expectations.",11,-0.843
1295,11,20,4.0,"Searching on Yelp for the Korean BBQ truck I heard about in Jersey City last night, I ended up finding out about this little cart. I'm surprised I've never known about this cart before, especially since I've done some part time sidework in the area in the past. I decided that to make up for it I'll have to make the trip for lunch to try it out. Luckily for me, I had the rare and much appreciated 2 hour lunch break today. I jumped on the R train to 49th street (yelp tried to make me exercise by telling me to get off at 34 street, teehee). When I got there I found this cart sandwiched between a halal cart and a soup cart. I got there a little before the noontime lunch rush so there was no line and no wait. I kind of hoped that there would have been a line or at least someone ahead of me so I wouldn't look like the obvious new guy who doesn't already know his order and has to stand there and stare at the pictures. I even purposely walked right by and scoped out the cart for a bit in hopes that someone would order. Alas I was way too early and nobody from the nearby offices were coming for lunch. Plan B. I pulled up Yelp and scoured the reviews for recommendations. After a few minutes of reading I finally worked up the courage to order. I walked up with confidence and suave and demanded a bulgogi box. (ok so maybe it went more like this) ""h-h-hi can I get a uhh.. uhh.. a bu-bulgogi box please? Regular or extra meat? ""uhh.. uhh.. extra?"" Spicy or regular? ""(low whisper) spicy"" Spicy? ""p-p-please."" Here you are. Thank you!(snatches bag and runs away)I ran to the closest seat I could find and popped open my box to find a good amount of rice, salad, japchae and bulgogi. At first it seemed like so little bulgogi but then while I was eating it there seemed to be a never ending amount. I tried eating with the chopsticks they gave me but it was a bit difficult to pick up the rice out of the styrofoam box with them. So after stuffing as much as I could in my mouth I packed it up and ran to the train to head back to school for a fork and spoon. The bulgogi was very tasty. It was quite good right up until the last piece. It just so happened to be tough and chewy. My teeth almost cracked from the initial bite. The japchae was really really good. I would have preferred a box full of japchae over the rice. Service at this little cart it great. In the few words I exchanged with the gentleman who runs the cart I felt that he was very nice and courteous. When he handed me my food he had a huge smile on his face and the way he thanked me actually sounded genuine. $7 for a bulgogi box with all the fixins. $2 for double the meat. I'd definitely come again to try other things but only if I'm in the area. The trip back and forth on a local train takes too long. Also I just don't get the satisfaction of grilling my own meat at Korean BBQ. Maybe it's a guy thing or maybe it's just me. Who knows, I am an odd one.",14,0.9891

J G Melon is expensive!Rachel: I am saving money! What makes you think I'm paying?Chun: *Bows Head in Shame*Perhaps the above conversation is enough to indicate that a venture to J. G. Melon was more by force than choice. Having already gone vegetarian for all of the meals consumed in the day, a nice burger cooked to medium temperature was somewhat tempting. With that in mind, it was off to J. G. Melon to see if the hype rendered is so valiantly deserved!The Decor: The old school wooden bar decor accompanied by the local UES crowd gives J. G. Melon a nod of approval. The restaurant itself is eerily similar to a bar with a few tables for dining. Dining tables are lined with green & white checkered table clothes. The seating itself is of sturdy wooden chairs that have survived a few decades of work. Needless to say, the atmosphere itself is homey and simplistic. Everything is more like a bar like atmosphere rather than your usual sit down restaurant.The Food:The Burger - No Fancy Toppings, No Cheese, Not Even Ketchup! The J. G. Melon Burger is meant to be eaten solely with the accompanying toasted white Burger bun. The Burger, is a deep seared chuck ground that boasts a combination of both 85% Ground and 93% Lean giving this concoction both the tender and firmness of the Burger as well as providing savory juices that are a byproduct of a perfect grilled Burger. The Burger is then placed on a 500 degree grill where a solidified encrustation is formed on the outer layer and securing the flavorful juices within the confinements. Upon grilling completion, the Burger is left to sit on a cooling surface for up to 5 minutes to allow the free flowing juices to redistribute. After it's all said and done, the Burger is served on a lightly toasted sesame bun with a side of pickles and onions. A single bite of this masterpiece is all that's needed to truly enjoy the true flavor of a well cooked Burger. The burger itself was cooked to a perfect medium as requested. In terms of taste, the burger itself possessed a natural meaty flavor that's accompanied by a mild detection of salt. The cooking apparatus provided a hint of charred flavoring on the burger. Although not required, both the onions and pickles provided an additional sweet & saltiness to the compilation. Needless to say, J. G. Melon's rendition is that of a classic burger with no fuss or enhancements required.20 minutes later, the burgers were done. With that, the check arrived. Surprisingly, both burgers weren't excessively expensive as the total bill after tax and tip came in at under $25.Best Burger in New York? Maybe... One thing is certain, J. G.

For the first time in a long time I am actually applauding an establishment in my neighborhood. The name is a little puzzling and if my dyslexia would have gone unchecked I would have referred to it as ""Some Guy's Brains"" on Second Avenue. A quick Google search confirms that the phrase is somehow translated to ""we're all the same under the skin.""

JTB is not a sports bar, but it has a handful of televisions. The most appealing factor for me, save the Scottish brew, was the way the bar was lit and decorated. Walls were dark wood and accentuated by dim lighting. The ceiling had an old school copper tin feeling, although I cannot confirm whether it was truly copper. The floor was comprised of various stones, which were not symmetric and provided a welcomed contrast to the sleek lines. Along with the puzzling name, there is an oddly placed picture next to the bar. If you are staring straight on at the bar, to the right is a painting hung upside down with two people (one a waiter) and a line of coffee cups. The upside down painting turned into the running joke of the evening, but maybe it was purposely done. How about that for a conversation starter? This appears to be a refuge for the older crowd, those who still want to go out and drink at a neighborhood bar, but who also want to get a little crazy and sing every other word to their favorite Journey song.

1301,21,19,4.0,"Dan Barber kept me up all night the other night. O geez, that came out wrong... let's try that again.As everyone is likely aware at this point, Dan Barber's Blue Hill restaurants represent a force of good in the fight against the commercialization, commoditization, and dumbification of what our nation shoves into our gullets. His point-of-view on locally sourced, sustainable, organic, farm-to-table has been rightfully critically acclaimed, loved and imitated by the nation's dining public. However, during a recent visit to Blue Hill, I'll add an additional and perhaps unintended platitude - 'slow food'.I'll get negativity out of the way - our dinner was beleaguered by alarmingly slow execution of food. While I couldn't determine if this was a lack of oversight of service or if the kitchen was at fault, from entry to exit, our meal approached the 4 hour mark and well past most of our self appointed bed times. I'm still internalizing if the food was 'worth the wait', but it certainly was choice.Starters and amuse's of asparagus and almond tarts as well as Dan Barber's signature crudités plate initiated the meal. The crudités, a swath of baby spring vegetables on a spiked bed, was borderline genius and borderline pretentious. Most diners should get the point of the dish - simple revelry of fresh vegetables at their most tender and flavorful stage. Diners will also revel in the bread basket, which interestingly was one of the highlights of the meal. Fresh, crusty, buttery ficelle's completed with local butter and a pinch of complimentary carrot or arugula essence'd salts - just awesome.Blue Hill's signature dish, a softly poached farm egg, which was allegedly laid within 24 hours of service, again highlighted the merits of simple and rustic food. Flavor-wise, it was superb, but lacked textural intrigue. The real star of the show was the grass fed loin and belly of lamb. Perfectly medium rare, subtly flavored, and completed with fingerling potatoes, sautéed greens and plump fiddlehead ferns, it was perhaps the best lamb dishes I've ever tasted.I'm told that Mr. Barber and his crew can sometimes be found in the Union Square greenmarket, collecting fresh produce for that evening's service. Therefore you might find me stalking them near the rhubarb section, so that I can properly thank them for the delicious meal... and perhaps a little chastising for keeping me up all night.Dan, I left my number next to your bed stand.

The Tres Leches cake was also superior to the nearby (drier) options. It was topped with a large strawberry that was flanked on one side with chocolate sprinkles and on the other by colorful ones and inspired somewhat by trifle pudding.

1304,12,11,4.0,"A deep sob shuddered through my body, and I bit into the chocolate. I waited for the taste to hit as the tears carved their gray pathways down my cheeks. The chocolate tasted the same as always: placating, and verging on stale. Reese's is nothing like Bouchon, and looking back now, that cup was really no match for the chocolate tart that lay stately in front of me on the kitchen table. But I didn't care then. I shoved the rest of the peanut butter cup in my mouth. I chewed slowly, my jaw tired, eyes bloodshot but still on the tart, staring back at me ominously in the stillness of the kitchen. ""What do you want from me?"" I screamed at it in my head as the tears ran thicker. Without breaking the staring match, I chucked the Reese's wrappers on the floor like a child in a tantrum and reached over to the brownie on the kitchen counter. You know the kind: It comes from a $2 pack of six, all tied together with the same theme of artificial colors and defective ingredients. Perfect. I opened my mouth wide, and embarked on a new challenge: Could I eat a whole brownie at once? I could, as it turned out. A new wave of anguish hit, as I watched the tart watching me, unmoved. The salty tears mixed in with the saccharine aftertaste of the junky duo created a watery flavor that tried to hold its own against Bouchon. They say quality wins over quantity, but right then, I couldn't care less what won.There had been times when it was different, though. Back in fall, I sought out quality. I could still see myself on that calm, cloudy Saturday, sitting upright at that small table against the glass, staring down into the crowd at Columbus circle. My eyes fell on that same tart ahead of me then. I sank a silver fork gently into the silky dark chocolate, and the moist crust had yielded cleanly into the break. A delicate sweep of refinement on the palate. Or biting into the feast that was the nutter butter cookie right after at Bouchon that day. I have an infamously short-term memory for certain things, including movies and names and locations ... and sometimes names of restaurants and desserts. But the nutter butter cookie I could still remember: It gave such a rich, moist punch after the coffee, and yet it still tasted like quality. The kind of quality that you instinctively take in slowly; otherwise, it cloys too quickly and ruins the experience. But those times were in the past. They dissolved into darkness now, leaving me with a lingering memory that too dissolved into emptiness. Then, at that precise moment of zero, I reached for the tart. Hark! Was this it? No, I decided. Tomorrow was another day. My hand wavered, and I grabbed the truffles next to it, instead -- old ones, dried up by now. I popped two into my mouth. Then I got up. Like a selfish kid, satiated and proud and tired and disgusted, I wiped my tears and pushed in the chair. It was over. I've never considered myself an emotional eater ... but sometimes, a good cry after an emotional day at the office can really reveal plenty of things -- like a need to let the incessant frustration roll out on its own healthy course and an incredible capacity for chucking crap into your belly. But the best of all: a positive reaffirmation that quality always beats quantity. For had it not been for the preciousness of quality, the tart would have been history like the rest. Perhaps that's the most comforting thought of all, for any bad day in New York City: It's the test of the true core of anything. Fall into it, and it's over. Persist for just a little while, and you are safe -- and later, in the easy folds of calm, you can integrate the song of real chocolate seamlessly into your temperament. If you're lucky, it'll be the song of Bouchon.",11,0.9636

He fills my chocolate dipped cannoli shell with the cannoli cream made with ricotta and sugar. Then he sprinkles powdered sugar over this sweet thang. That's love from the Italians. And this chocolate dipped cannoli shell? Best thing ever. I oohed and aahed at my cannoli, especially at the shell, until I took my first bite. The cream is nothing to write home about, but that shell is fantastic. I wasn't impressed with the filling at all, but I can rave about that shell forever. The nice thing about this bakery is that they also offer a mini version of the chocolate dipped shell cannoli, for those who can't eat a giant one. That will never happen to me. Other than that, I recommend you eat yours outside so those obnoxious Italian hosts will stop haranguing you to eat inside their restaurant because you'll be wearing powdered sugar and chocolate all around your mouth.",12,0.8295

Only slightly. The short of it all is that Perilla's food is well prepared and perfectly cooked. It doesn't blow my mind in much of the way that I have come to expect from such a famed restaurant, but it's still worth coming to and easily one of the restaurants that could easily become a favorite haunt - especially since one of the bar items was listed as duck fat popcorn. How amazing does that sound?! Before I get into the food, I want to elaborate on the excellent service here. They're incredibly gracious and patient with you - over the phone and in person. If you're the last customers there until just past midnight, they're still in no hurry to push you out the door. To me, it was pure excellence. Ask and they'll explain the menu to you. Ask if the Chef might be around, and they're still really nice even though you just ousted yourself as one of those Top Chef groupies. *cough Fel* Warm, knowledgeable, and patient is how I'd describe Perilla's lovely staff. Okay. Food time!-quack quack-We started off with the Spicy Duck Meatballs, which were served with a quail egg in the center of 4 meatballs.

Next time, I'm hoarding one all to myself!-quack-For my entree, I ordered the Tea Smoked Duck Breast, which was served with bok choy sprouts, brown rice (gotta have my carbs!), toasted garlic, apriums (a cross between an apricot and a plum), and spicy chili jam. It came out super rare. (This is a good thing.) Deliciously tender, I enjoyed every last bite. The duck was perfect. It left nothing wanting. You could distinctly smell and taste the apriums - a taste I have actually been craving for a while.

1307,20,30,4.0,"I'm sorry, I love Popeye's and all, much more than I should in fact, but what's with all the reviews here saying their chicken is the ""best""? Am I missing some kind of small-scale meme or are you people legitimately insane? Popeye's isn't the ""best"" anything, unless we're talking about ""best"" purely in terms of the category of weirdest, grossest place I've ever seen an Internet cafe installed into. (Yum yum, nothing like eating a bucket of coronary then checking IMDB on a public keyboard covered in the crumbs and grease of ten thousand fat strangers in an establishment that actively encourages finger-licking! Where do I insert my dollar for ten minutes?) I mean, Pies 'n' Thighs isn't perfect, neither, but comparing it to Popeye's in any way/shape/form is ludicrous. In fact, let's get my biggest complaints about this place out of the way: I hate Williamsburg, I hate hipsters, and chances are, I probably hate you. I hate how ridiculous it is getting to/from here unless you already live here or near the JMZ, which as far as I'm concerned, may as well go to fucking Narnia. I also hate how inadequately air-conditioned it was in here, though I'm not totally sure that's a hipster thing, but it sure seems like it is: ""Eeeeeuuugh, look at me, I don't need comfortable, artificially conditioned air, not when I have my MUSIC""Okay, I just wanted to get all my unreasonable/tangential complaints out of the way, and clarify that I am not deducting a star for any of them. Although I really want to.So anyway, yeah, fried chicken! Here, it is delicious. I mean really really good. I had to think about it a while, but in the end, I put just slightly under the chicken I've had at Brooklyn Bowl (which has the edge in juiciness, and is the best I've ever had). Rest assured though, the chicken here is wonderfully seasoned and fried, and yes, kicks the ever-loving shit out of Popeye's. This is one of those meals that immediately makes everyone you're eating with totally stupid and silent, partly from sheer paralytic unhealthiness and partly because you're all so amazed/grateful at all the wonderful things going on in your mouth that it requires your full attention.Unfortunately, at least in comparison to the chicken, the sides didn't quite hold up their end of the bargain. My mac 'n' cheese was lukewarm, bordering on cold, a cardinal sin that disqualifies it from consideration. And the biscuits, similarly, were just okay. I like my biscuits soft and a bit warm, and these were not, though serving it with honey butter helps.The fries, for their part, were certainly fries.As for the ""Pies"" part , the apple pie we had (which had a generous dollop of whipped cream on the side, and, interestingly, a thick slice of cheddar underneath), was pretty tasty, though not quite occupying the same space on the ""worth going out of your way for"" scale as the chicken. It is safe to say that I probably would've appreciated it even more had my stomach not already been exploding with chicken grease, however.All in all, though, a pretty great meal that I will almost assuredly never have again unless someone literally kidnaps me and takes me there. That's right, screw you, your bowties, your male short-shorts, AND your tasty, tasty fried chicken, entire subsection of Brooklyn!",22,0.7965
1308,12,8,4.0,"Little Pepper is yet another restaurant in the neighbourhood I've told myself to try, only to time and again succumb to my yearning for the food at other restaurants which I already know to be good. One Friday night I finally resolved to march my ass over there and have dinner. This restaurant is located in a very non-descript location with a relatively small amount of foot traffic for Flushing, and at the basement level, no less. It's very easy to miss unless you were looking for it, but I actually get my hair cut every three or four weeks at a barber shop just a couple of doors from it, so I've took mental note of this restaurant for a while now.Little Pepper is appropriately named since it serves Sichuan cuisine, which is known to be spicy. It was about 9 o'clock at night when I walked in, and it was clearly very busy inside. In fact, all the tables were occupied. The dining area was served by a middle aged woman and a young man who could be the woman's son and was probably drafted into working at the family business. Though I did not ask, so I could be wrong. This team of two was basically running around taking orders and fulfilling their requests without a second to even take a breath. They clearly needed to hire more people to work there on weekend nights. At various times the cooks even brought the dishes out from the kitchen and asked one of the waiters which table the dishes should go to. They have four or five small tables that can sit four people, and three big round tables. One of the big tables was only occupied by two people, and after about five minutes of waiting, I was finally sat down to share the big table with the party of two.Now maybe it is boring of me, but everytime I go to a Sichuan restaurant, I order the Shui Zhu Niu - literally translated as ""Water Cooked Beef"". At Little Pepper, this dish is listed as Braised Beef in Spicy Soup Base. In one of my previous reviews of another restaurant in Flushing, I have described this very spicy dish of braised beef soaked in a big pot or bowl of peppery sauce. It is one of my favourite dishes and also the dish with which I measure how good or authentic a Sichuan restaurant is. I also noticed they have rabbit meat dishes and I had wanted to order the Diced Rabbit Meat in Red Chilli Sauce, which is listed as an appetiser on their menu. Unfortunately they were out of rabbit meat. Instead I settled on the Shredded Potato with Pickled Cabbage, which the people I was sharing the table with were eating and assured me was very good.About ten minutes of waiting, the Shredded Potato with Pickled Cabbage was served. This is a simple dish of stir fried shredded potatos and pickled cabbage. The Chinese name of the dish indicated this should be a sour dish, but instead it was spicy. The potato itself was not spicy, however, it was the pickled cabbage that was spicy. Taking a bite of both the potato and the spicy pickled cabbage together made for a great contrast of flavours, though ultimately, this dish was not something that really stood out. The dish was not very spicy at all, it was only spicy enough to tingle your mouth. But I have a feeling that's how it was supposed to be. A little while later, the Shui Zhu Niu came out, and to my relief, they served it correctly with the beef literally swimming in a big bowl of spicy peppery sauce. I have been to other Sichuan restaurants where they do not do this, and only served the beef on a plate. They also had the spiciness level right, which was extremely spicy, to the point where you could feel the spiciness by simple contact of your tongue to the beef. The beef was also very tender as it ought to be. I was sweating embarassingly while eating this dish as I usually do when I eat very spicy dishes. At this point I was noticing that since the team of two waiters were so busy, some of the customers simply went to the cooler in the back of the dining area to get cold drinks for themselves. So I followed their lead and got up to get myself a cold bottle of Budweiser to soothe the spiciness in my mouth. In my opinion there is really very few eating experiences as enjoyable as eating a very spicy dish while drinking cold and bitter beer. It's a feeling that I can only describe as ""tong kuai"" in Chinese - I don't think there is a direct English translation for this phrase, but it describes a sort of carefree feeling of joy. It's a feeling that you might experience if you were driving down an empty highway in a convertible at 100 miles per hour, or if you were out partying with dear old friends till 4 in the morning without a hint of being tired, or if you were eating a very spicy dish with a cold beer to wash it down.",15,0.9926
1309,15,16,4.0,"I have been to tropical islands. I love the fun and sun, but most of the cocktails I've had were sub-par blender blunders. Fortunately, PK co-owners Richie (M&H, LB, DK) and Giuseppe (DK, Clover Club and more) believe that Manhattan is the best island in the world, and they were inspired by classic tiki culture (yes, there is such a thing) to bring a taste of the islands to OUR island. You'll be glad they did. They don't take reservations, so the space may be crowded at first - especially on weekends. And crowds don't help the ventillation, but calm yourself and pretend you're in the tropics. After your first sip of a cocktail, you'll forget the crowd, the heat or whatever ails you. I went with the namesake Painkiller, a creamy, fresh nutmeg-topped delight. You could also opt for a Scorpion Bowl or try their elevated take on a Mai Tai. And these boys give good garnish. In addition to R. and G. behind the stick, you'll see some of the industy's best taking shifts. Browse the beautiful placemat menus or take the Milk and Honey approach of sharing your mood and letting the bartender take it from there.

1311,13,12,4.0,"My friend asked me if I want to try some ""fish heads, eel bones and beer."" And I gave him a stare as if he's out of his mind and I nervously said ""sure...""This type of food is only served the first Saturday of each month from 10PM-11:30PM, so reservations may be hard to come by. But I guess he was lucky and was able to get reservations during the day for that night. We've arrived at the restaurant and it was a cloud of confusion. The hostess asked us if we were there for the Makanai, a Japanese kitchen tradition that demonstrates both cooking skills and the wise use of inventory remainders in feeding the staff or in other words curious people like us. And yup that is exactly why we were there and she directed us to go straight to the bar.At this point I was still confuse. Why aren't we getting seated at a table, but rather lining up by the counter to get our food as if this was some sort of very fancy soup kitchen? Turns out this is how it works, it is like a family style buffet type of dinner. Which was pretty interesting. So the bartender gives each person a glass for their unlimited refills of Sapparo and you look for a seat in the communal tables.*You simply line up, pick up a dish and fight for all you can eat food - you know the whole buffet drill. I kid. That is not how it works, everyone there were so friendly and lined up in an orderly way and waited for their turn. First dish I came across were their tofu. The tofu was just okay. I like my tofu either fried or in a very smooth substance preparation. Or even better, give me some syrup and I make ""tofufa"", this Chinese sweet tofu dessert. mMm would love to have some right now...Second is the udon noodle salad in light broth. If you are like me, who can't use chopsticks properly, no worries! They provide you with proper serving utensils, so you would not make a fool out of yourself having noodles fly all over the place, especially while trying to impress that special someone. The noodles was served cold, but I liked it very much. It was pretty light to taste. Following dish was the chicken katsu, which was pretty nicely breaded. But it wasn't really one of the highlights of that night's dinner. Honestly, I can get chicken katsu in many Japanese restaurants or even in Chinese owned restaurants that serves Japanese food. Til today I still don't quite get it, why is it that so many sushi restaurants are owned by Chinese people? Next up is the Chirashizushi, which is a bowl of rice with scattered sashimi, shredded seaweed and sesame. Hmmm...I did say sashimi, but why is it each time I went to get another serving all I see left is the seaweed, sesame and lots of rice? Oh wait, if I looked carefully, I see a smidge of sashimi. So I guess it was a little aggressive when it came to this dish, everyone else stripped the sashimi off this bowl of rice. But that's okay I like the seaweed and sesame any way, so that means more for me. But luckily they always bring out new batches when supplies are low and I finally got to have some of the sashimi. This dish was pretty good, I liked it. But I think I was getting full from just the rice alone, yet it was still very good!Then it was the highlight of the night - crunchy deep fried eel and fluke bones. Wow, these were amazingly delicious! I couldn't help it, but every time I went back to refill my plate, I would skip everything else and go straight to this dish. Each bite was crunchy until the last bite. It was full of flavor. Who knew fried eel and fluke bones would taste so good? Next in line is the sake-marinated whole roasted tuna collar, but every time I go up to get more food, all I see are bones. Argh, those aggressive fish eaters didn't save any for me! I remembered my mother always told me to eat more fish, while I was growing up. Now I want fish, but there's no more and I had to scrape off scraps of meat from between each little bone and put together a dish of fish for myself. I think the server pitied me and they brought out a new untouched dish all just for me! Yay! Poor me didn't have to scrape for pieces of meat any longer and can use my poor chopstick skills to get slabs of fish meat piled on my plate. The fish was pretty good with a subtle taste of sake.Last but not least, it was the fish head soup. The broth was very flavorful and infused with the taste of fish. No, not that fishy smell from fish markets, but rather a very rich fish oil kind of taste. When they said fish head soup, they were not kidding, it was the real deal because occasionally I would need to spit up some fish scales.*If you can't find a seat at the communal tables by the bar area for the Makanai, do not panic. There are more tables on the left side from the hostess by the main entrance.P.S. - Good luck balancing a glass of Sapparo, a plate of food, a bowl of fish head soup, juggling a napkin, holding a spoon with your nose and clenching a pair of chopsticks between your teeth.",15,0.9989

(One can opt for an additional course for an extra $10). Service began with an amuse bouche of cauliflower panna cotta served in its own chalice. Visually striking and nicely done. I have never been a fan of cauliflower, but I did find this course manageable. An elegant beginning.For the first course, I ordered the lobster salad. A perfect salad. The lobster was served in two parts: the main claw meat as well as several round sections placed together forming the body of the plate. The lobster meat was interspersed with greens and this all lied over a bed of sauce. The lobster was fresh and served at a lovely temperature. The sauce was slightly piquant and added depth of flavor to the dish and made it consistently interesting as a whole. A very balanced beginning.For the second course, I went with the dorade. This was presented as a very large rectangular section served skin side up over a wonderful pistou including a nice selection of heirloom beans. All of the flavors were tight and clean. The textures initially were all perfect. This seemed like a perfect dish. Making my way through the dish though, I noticed uneven texture in the dorade. Studying a cross section of the fish, I saw hues of pink and purple near the skin in some of the thicker areas of the fish. It was these isolated areas that contributed to a change in texture and taste. I ate all of the unaffected portions of the dish and left behind the suspect pieces. I wasn't sure what to make of them. Was this consistent with dorade, a fish I have only eaten a handful of times in my life? Or was uneven cooking the culprit here? I inquired with the captain who then inquired with the chef. The verdict: my sample included a portion near the belly where the texture is known to change. I found that to be a dubious explanation, but I accepted it. Waiting for my dessert course, and having finished my wine, I noticed the captain approaching my table with a bottle of grenache. Sure enough, I was being treated to a complimentary glass of dessert wine (a grenache). Clearly an example of exceptional service and professionalism at all times -- a very nice gesture.For dessert, I had the dacquoise. Dacquoises are great! They look so stately when they are served, but they quickly become a gooey, decadent mess. Theirs was done with hazelnut and milk chocolate and was complemented by an intense raspberry sorbet served to the side. Lovely all around, and of course the dessert wine was excellently chosen to complement those deep notes. A grand finish to a rather elegant meal. Dessert was followed by a quick, complimentary tour of the chocolate trolley, before properly concluding.The setting is quite nice. I was in a banquette right next to the door leading to the main sculpture garden. This also afforded me a long view of the formal dining room likely giving me the best seat in the restaurant. The space is set up in a way, a la Frank Lloyd Wright, where your attention is naturally pushed to the outside to enjoy the garden. Being a beautiful day on my visit, this proved very pleasing.A surprise winner -- recommend!",13,0.9992

However, it IS the case at Crosby Connection. Their sandwich menu contains so many drool-worthy items that I stood in front of it for a good several minutes just staring, mouth agape, possibly ACTUALLY drooling. The owner was so super nice, though, making lots of recommendations and applauding my (long-awaited) choice of the Suzy special--prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil, roasted red peppers, and balsamic. Yes.This sandwich was $6. I can't even remember the last time I paid that little for a sandwich, and SUBWAY DOESN'T COUNT. I don't eat at Subway anymore, anyway. I'm sitting here at one of their 6 or so tables and chairs that appear to be covered in my grandma's hand-knit afghan blankets and saran wrap. It's definitely a decorating technique with which I am not familiar, but this is a funky kind of place, so it works.You know what else works? The wi-fi, man. In a world in which free cafe wi-fi is more often than not spotty at best and non-existent at worst, this is almost too good to be true. Every single little wi-fi signal bar on my laptop is happily activated, and pages load as fast as they do on my home wi-fi. So all of that is great. Add in the fact that they play Motown, and that we're just a few blocks from my gym and one of my jobs, and well, I think it's safe to say that we're looking at my new go-to lunchtime spot.",22,0.9815

1323,10,15,4.0,"I really want to give Rockaway five stars, but I wont. I LOVE the beach, and this is the best (least expensive) option for New Yorkers. You can take public transit (A to Shuttle) so it costs practically nothing for a day at the beach. For me, it takes about 1.5 hours door to door (or beach), but I live in Harlem. Typically you're looking at about an hour commute, but it's well worth it.If you surf, skim, or boogie, then you'll want to go to Beach 90th street stop. You have two blocks of beach, where no swimming is allowed, only boarding- from 88th to 90th. If you come with a group and some may want to get in the water, post up at either 88 or 90, so you can do both fairly easily. If you want to rent a board, or pick up some gear, check out Boarders Surf Shop and Skate at 192 Beach 92nd street. $30 for half day, $50 for full day board rental. If you want to check the conditions, go to- surfline.com/surf-report…If you dont want to Surf, you can go further or all the way down on the shuttle. The beaches are much larger. The only downside to this, is that this is where a lot of the kiddies go to hang out. So you may encounter a lot of immature, disrespectful (to humans and the environment) behavior. There is a lot of litter and such down here.   The reason for 4 and not 5 stars- The lifeguards can be quite irksome. I understand that they have a job to do, but come on. Sometimes they wont even let you get out 20 yards before they start blowing their whistles. I just turn my back and ignore them, then when I get back to the shore, I act like I didnt know they were talking to me.  Next, it can get riddled with litter. This isnt the beaches fault of course, its the beach goers. At the surfers beach there is far less refuse, as I think people are more responsible. And yes the boardwalk can be kind of sketch, so treat it like sex- always wear protection.**NOTE**  Perhaps you and I are of the same mindset; beach and beer, go as hand-in-hand as Catholic priests and alter boys do. Be careful here. I always pour my beer (do cans) into a cup to attract less attention. Ive found that at the Surfer beach, it is less of an issue. All the way down at 116, on two separate occasions, I have actually had a woman check into my cooler as I walked down the boardwalk. She made me turn around. I just walked a few blocks up, but still. So keep your alkie in a bag, and you should be okay.All-in-all, Far Rockaway is a great choice for a day excursion from the city. So hop on the train, head on out. When you get there dont forget toNot dance, pull up your pants, and do The Rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back...",19,0.9863
1324,31,29,4.0,"I love being outside. And I love live classical music, particularly when performed by the New York Philharmonic. I also love dinner picnics with wine at dusk. Why, then, is this review not 5 stars? Well, I shall tell you.First off, you have to arrive 2 hours early just to make sure you snag a place to sit. And even then, the late-comers jam in the small spaces you were relishing between you and your closest neighbors. Secondly, if you're lucky, the group of people next to you will talk throughout the concert, making your ability to hear the music minimal. While inhaling all of their cigarette smoke, you instead get to overhear conversations about how GREAT NY is in the summer, why NYU is cooler than Columbia, and how Bob is the worst in bed because he has the hairiest back EV-ERRRRR. The rich people up front have to cue you when to clap, because between the smoke, gossip, crying babies, and lack of personal space, it's hard to tell when one piece has ended and the next has begun. When you can actually hear the music, however, it is amazing (not to mention free). Dusk in the park is always magical, and outdoor wine-picnic opportunities are not to be missed. So what I recommend is the following: Get up as close to the front as you can for Part 1 of the concert. At intermission - or whenever you become overwhelmed by the non-musical-noise of the crowd - make your way to the back of the Great Lawn. You can't see much unless you're sitting in the front anyway, and the speakers provide enough oomph for you to feel like you are close to the orchestra. Plus, you have lots of free space, can actually smell the (semi) fresh air, and can watch bats wheel in circles in the darkening sky.",28,0.9913

The final product is well presented and accompanied by a tiny glass of water, if you want it.But coffee magic doesn't come cheaply. One recent afternoon when I stopped in for an espresso, I overheard some Italians saying ""e' carissimo!"" or, ""it's really expensive!"" And yes, if you're used to paying 80 cents for espresso, $2.50 does feel like a dirty crime.I'll keep coming here though, because at Culture, there are no sushi lunches, no chicken caesar salads, no egg & cheese breakfast baguettes.

1326,24,21,4.0,"To celebrate(?) Cinco de Mayo, we headed to the newly open Cienfurgos last night. Since there is no sign outside but the obviously colorful store front looking like an ice cream parlor, I almost rang somebody's apartment with the same address, 443 E 6th Street thinking of another speakeasy door. Downstairs is small, cute and as I said before colorful ice cream parlor, we waited there for our table upstairs. You can sit at the bar downstairs for some bites and drinks until you are ready to be escorted by the guy who checks your ID. The girl downstairs is very pretty and exotic to make you feel that you already are in for some cultural experience. Brought to you by the owner of Death & Co and Mayahuel, first I thought Cienfuergos was Mexican but it was Cuban. Not for long, we got a table and went through this rough(?) back alley up a steel stairs to the lounge. The girl from the downstairs bar hinted that their ribs are the one what we must order. Upstairs was very like a fairy tale garden in antique style. Main color mixes of bold aqua green, pink and white. Country vineyard like with the white metal fences. Pouring natural light of twilight thru the windows. The stylish white couch chairs lovingly comforted us. Plastic upholstery tho, I guess being a spill proof? Well, my friend accidentally knocked the water glass on me, yes she did and it ended up being an easy drying up but also feeling like in a summer pool already. We had some cocktails($13-14) and the cuban ribs ($15) and cortadito (coffee, which is a latin espresso with a couple drops of milk). According to my friend, cortadito literally means, coffee cut by milk. It is quite different from coffee with milk which was also in the menu. Only a couple of drops of milk is shot into the espresso. A hint of milk, not being diluted. How interesting. The cocktails were excellent. The menu is very extensive with the big theme of Cuba, Ernest Hemingway and Rum punches. Also they use raw and dry herbs as finishing touch which I found quite interesting. I had La Hanana b/c it had most number of ingredients out of all menu and my friend got Isle Pine Punch (I forgot the exact name). Mine came with the chamonile sprinkled on top and my friends had a star anise in the cocktail. La Habana was rather more tropical and I loved the every drop of it. So fragrant and lemony, too. You can order cocktails by the glass or sized up to punch bowl and on, which comes in silver punch bowl for self serving ($33 and up for various sizes.). Definitely better for the bucks and feeling like a garden party. The ribs were so yummy and tender but I would want it a little more seasoned. Came with the smashed fried plantain was a little dry. I wanted to try Tamales but since the ribs were recommended so...... Though, I am expecting something similar good as Tamales at Mayahuel which I loved. And of course, Cuban sandwich next time. However, if you want just food I suggest you get from downstairs not waiting for upstairs. Upstairs are more for drinks and chilling. The service was very smooth and good. The bill came in a cuban cigar box as a nice final touch which i wished a real thing in it. We will come back. Quite refreshing and what a brighten up place Cienfuegos was. Highly recommended. P.S. Few improvements needed.. (which resulted in a half star reduction) so overall 3.5 stars.1. Bathroom was not quite done yet and there indeed was an apology sign on the door.2. The alley way to upstairs, while I was walking down the stairs holding the bar, the hot water pipe was in the way also touching the bar, I jumped upon touching the hot pipe and almost stumbled to fall down the stairs. These pipes are needed to be covered immediately.",27,0.9992
1327,19,15,4.0,"Before food trucks were trendy, before Starbucks popped up on 46 st. and when the 7 line still utilized the Redbird trains, the Taqueria Dalia Taco Truck stood under the Sunnyside arches every night serving late night workers, drunken pedestrians, and faithful regulars.Although I've moved out of Sunnyside, my friends and I still manage to make our way to one of our favorite taco trucks.

1328,30,29,4.0,"The answer to this riddle should help you get the most out of your yelping experience:Q: How can you tell a yelper from California who knows good Mexican food.A: You can't. They tell you. :)Ok, this is my last pot shot at those who don't know that it's been a few decades since folks started migrating to New York from southern Mexican states like Puebla and Guerrero and introduced not just their home cooking but also ingredients from Mexico. Sunset Park boasts many fine delis and trucks (have you seen the line outside Tacos Bronco?) serving good Mexican food. La Flor de Piaxtla is one of them.I blame the Horchata. Forced to pick between Ricos Tacos: a recommendation by Lisa D, and La Flor de Piaxtla: a recommendation by Mama Unlucky and Briana, I chose the latter deli as they hadn't run out of Horchata. I might not even have debated the choice, for in my next visit I saw a handwritten sign: Ricos Tacos on the window of The Flower of Piaxtla (a town in Puebla). I don't know whether the two are owned by the same folks, but the difference in ambience between the two is like the difference between Salsa Verde and Salsa Roja.""Salsa Verde"", I repeated when the server asked me to pick sides and the concerned look on her face at the selection of green, forced me to ponder: Does Absinthe make the heart grow fonder?Pleasure and pain - Cecina y Salsa Verde. I must confess, the dish activated all my paranasal sinuses. It was fiery and thoroughly tested the soothing qualities of the Horchata. But, I can handle heat and the server smiled when I didn't ask her to upgrade the size of my drink. Truth be told, of all the items on the menu I've tried here (Tacos: Suadero, Carne Asada, Barbacoa, Pollo) the grainy Horchata was the only disappointment, compared to the superlative, almost sublime, version at Tulcingo Deli.A flower shop outside, grocery items, magazines and CDs inside - La Flor de Piaxtla is no hole in the wall, even the programming on display wasn't too jarring, and once the taste buds had gone green, I had a relaxing experience - till the music changed to a Spanish version of Hotel California.

Appropriate for a tapas place, perhaps, but his Christmas tip just got halved.We arrived at the restaurant in time to listen to some bespectacled, quasi-intellectual fartpants complain to the host. In a grave tone one would normally reserve for Holocaust references or cancer diagnoses, he declared that he didn't like the seats one bit. Not the location, mind you, because all the seats are around the open kitchen. He didn't like the actual, physical seats. The seats were ""unfit for humans"" he said and he presumed that the host didn't realize how awful the seats were because the host was too busy to sit in them. He was very upset about the seats. The host listened, nodded, feigned empathy and ultimately apologized before the miserable bastard headed out the door with his unfortunate ladyfriend - presumably to complain about the humidity, pigeons, genetically-modified wheat and something he read in the New Yorker.We were seated earlier than our 8:30 reservation. The seats were absolutely fine.We opted for the 10-plate tasting menu. I decided to be brave even though the line-up included goat meatballs and rabbit paté. I've had rabbit paté before, by accident. I've never eaten goat. Coincidentally, the previous day I was upstate petting goats so the idea of eating a goat was somewhat unappealing to me.

I mean really, it was like a race to see how many dishes they could put onto our table all at once and figure out how to fit them all onto the surface like it was some sort of edible puzzle.I am getting ahead of myself for a bit. Let me go back a little. My family and I decided to have a family gathering here to celebrate Father's Day. There was 6 of us so we knew we were going to order a decent amount of food.

It would have been 9 but they ran out of space. Not that they didn't try to fit it in somehow.

1336,33,25,4.0,"""Manhattan is the greatest island on Earth""I'm tempted to stop here as with this headline at Painkiller's site I just should give a try. But one sentence reviews induce lately no other than ""unlikes"" so ... yelp.com/biz/1-sentence-… Painkiller is a Tiki bar. If you tell me that before urbandaddy reveals this new opening in the East side, I'd laugh on you as from my Spanish background tiki is such a funny word. But happen to be a whole culture in USA referring to restaurants and bars that involve Polynesian-themed and funny use of Tiki carvings and mythology. It was born a while ago in Hollywood ... of course. From a bar theme, a whole Tiki cuisine and cocktails was generated since then. The archetype for cocktails? Mai tai. Another populars include Scorpion and Zombies. In fact, Painkiller refers to a classic tiki cocktail. Now I understand the name. I was quite happy too with my assumption that after a couple of drinks over there all pains must be killed either because you forget about it, or because you have such a great time that makes it relative or most likely because of both. I have to say however, that Tiki cocktails are not my favorites. I just find them sweet, not balanced for my taste and the ice is just too much. But I have it before and Painkiller know how to do it. Well, you should now that two of the owners of Dutch Kills, an speakeasy located at LIC with a category reaching the best of the best, are behind Painkiller. They are owners and they are actually there. But in the top of that blenders are everywhere in the bar as the fruit juices are fresh squeezed and all seem to be fresh made and natural. As Polynesian theme you can imagine the aesthetic of the place. Bamboo walls, colorful, flowers, Hawaii, topless Polynesian women* and funny Tikis. And let me give you too Tiki's definition: Polynesian carvings in humanoid form. Another killer word. HumanoidAt first step you will see people drinking colorful drinks through long straws in crazy glasses? if I can call it like that, as those are actually ceramic pots characterizing Tikis or empty pineapples. Add to this a candle on fire in the top in a few of them. If we go further, the concept is also about friends gathering. There is a few seats at the bar where you can directly interact with the owners while they make your cocktails; guys that by the way are funny and superfriendly. But there is a few tables in the back for groups of 6 or so where bowls of your selected drink will be served. But most importantly you can order Scorpions, classic and signature versions of this drink served in big bowls for 4 to 6 people to share.  The ones that we tried included: Swizzled, Painkiller, Cradles of life and the flights. A visual Festival all of them. The flights are 3 different cocktails: mango, strawberry or banana very strong and large. The friend who order this was just shocked. Well, we all were shocked seeing what it was served as by flight we all think about small glasses. Well not here. But I highly recommend Cradles of life. This one I liked a lot. And happen to be a version of Scorpions, the one that you will order for your group. And this one, is also the one with fire in the top. Even this are not my favorite drinks and I'd rate it 3.5 because of that, the whole theme is a plus. The service, superplus if I can use this word. And I may not crazy about coming back tomorrow or this weekend. But Painkiller truly represent the Tiki culture for what I have read. And at Painkiller happiness is all around. Like when you are on vacation. Nothing can be wrong.Aloha* in paints and pictures in the walls, guys.... you really thought this was for real?",36,0.9943

Shh, don't tell anyone, but I ate 75% of it and I think I forgot to wish the birthday boy. If you think that's shameful, DON'T JUDGE ME TILL YOU'VE EATEN THIS CAKE, OKAY?This cake is very special. You have to refridgerate it within 30 minutes or it will self destruct (something to the effect). Three layers, dark chocolate rich and dense, and the lighter layers fluffy as a pillow. A tad sweet, maybe, but good texture. Gooood.They have cakes ranging from delightfully fresh (pear almond) to heavenly fluffy (choc mousse) and tangy creamy (cheesecake). The staff, while friendly and eager to help, didn't have very many recommendations to make.

DELICIOUS AND CHEAP. I am yelling FOR EMPHASIS.Then I meet the lady at this here joint for lunch and holy CRAP you would not believe the amount of food they give you for $9. Let me paint you a picture.First, they put down a bread board with a bacony spread, bread, and cucumbers.Then, at least at lunch, you order their $9 pre-fixe. Yes, nine goddamn dollars. You know what you get for lunch in downtown Brooklyn for $9? I shitty sandwich, that's what. So I start with their pickled cucumber soup which tastes just like Russian potato salad. Never had Russian potato salad? You must!This soup had pickles, dill, peas, carrots, and onions in a creamy, wonderful broth. The lady had the borscht and it was equally delightful, though I ate a very large bean that kinda freaked me out. This was a giant bean.I knew not to finish the soup. I could've just eaten the soup for lunch by itself, actually; there was so much of it. So I ate about half.I ordered the pork cutlet with potatoes and a side of beets for my entree and it was huge! The potatoes could've been hotter and some kind of sauce would've been nice but it still was quite good. I couldn't even finish half.The lady got the Polish sausage plate with potatoes and pickled red cabbage. Her meal was even better. The kielbasa seemed to be braised with onions in beer, and the pickled cabbage was delightful. She also couldn't finish.Then came the desserts. They were pretty awful. She got the cheesecake and I the apple pie. Terrible. But that was fine cause there wasn't any room left in our bellies anyway.When the server took our plates away I mentioned something about the size of the portions, to which she responded ""In Poland we like to eat a lot of food"". I'll say.When I come back to this place, I'm going to do it better. This is the kind of joint where you eat for two hours and take your time. You make big gestures with your arms and hands while talking and you drink giant glasses of beer. The service is great and it seems all the employees here are female, including the cooks, which I liked. I will definitely be back.",17,0.9941

Minca is a traditionalist ramen shop, the kind that fits in perfectly in the East Village, devoid of any glitz or ambience. It turns out bowl after bowl of steaming hot pork broth, slices of fat laced pork, and slightly chewy and dense ramen noodles. A side order of gyozas turned to be a plate of perfectly pan fried dumplings with a juicy and authentic filling. Minca is the perfect place to go when you don't want to deal with the Momofuku hype, can't stand the 1 hour+ wait at Ippudo, and don't feel like rubbing elbows with the NYU crowd at Setagaya. The no frills attitude demonstrates respect for this great culinary tradition.

Everything about this place and food screams Sicily, I imagine Sofia from the Golden Girls telling Rose, Dorothy, and Blanche about this place ""Picture this. Sicily 1912. Best friends who share three things: a recipe, some dough, and a dream."" The place looks as though it has not been remodeled or even touched since it first opened 100 years ago, from the old heater in the center of the room, to the antique drawers placed strategically around the cafe to give it the home feel. Lots of newspaper articles and reviews adorn the walls, which i am not that fond of however I looked beyond because of all of the images of Italia and the respected familigia outnumbered the reviews... Highlights 1. Supposedly the ONLY place on the east coast to have Manhattan Special on TAP. Every time i tell someone that, they get so excited, and every time I try to convince myself I like the drink - i come to the sad stark realization that I may never be able to force myself into liking this drink... 2. The prices are considerably cheap for LUNCH. I wouldn't recommend coming here for dinner unless you had plans to be in the neighborhood or you live in the area. 3. I told the owner who is always present during lunch time and just loves to talk to others, that I never tried Panelle so he got the waitress to make me two and try them on the house... 4. Fried Calamari... MmmMm 5. The hot sandwiches but make sure you add ""Ricotta and Cheese"" for $1.00 to any one you get.... Sandwiches are 5 bucks on a roll and 8 bucks on a hero (the roll will fill you up) 6. Arancina Special (Rice ball Special) Classic Rice ball with meat, peas, sauce topped with Ricotta n Cheese will cost ya 6 bucks and you will get a basket of fresh bread to use for dipping... 7. There are only 2 daytime waitresses and i met them both and I love them both... 8. If you sit by the back window (the only window), you will see a cute little Brooklyn garden and a Madonna statue right in the center of it all, reminds me of ""old school"" Brooklyn backyards that always had the statue... Dislikes: 1. NO free refills... I could understand the Manhattan Special but I cannot for the life of me understand why places do that with regular easy to come by soda... So order water - you do know that Bklyn has the best water right? 2. The location. I walk here because sometimes i work nearby however if i did not live somewhat close i would not come here for dinner, MAYBE lunch on a nice day where walking is a touch easier... 3. The panelle, I expected so much and got nothing.... It was okay and sure covered in sauce and ricotta it would be better, but anything covered under those items would make it automatically tastier! 4. Come here for lunch not dinner, the entrees look on the smaller side and are not that cheap considering we are deep in the heart of Red Hook... 5. When you wash your hands in the bathroom, turn the water on just a TOUCH, I turned it on normally and it splashed all over me, well not like a Wet T-Shirt contest but almost...",18,0.9966

I had 3 bottles of wine with my friend at DBGB yesterday, had more wine at Mercat, decided on some apps at BondSt and while walking (barely walking) I realized I need to replenish my Scent of Peace supply. I am so glad I did. I missed this scent!I am a big Jo Malone fan but if it weren't for Bond's price point, I'd most likely shop here more often. Then again, the price point is one of the factors why I cherish the visits to this store and walking out with a baggy filled with months of comments from cab drivers, friends, loved ones - all wanting to know what I'm wearing. SCENT OF PEACE! Again, having background in fragrance, it's so personal to choose scents for oneself. I don't believe in men's, women's, unisex, whatever. You need to try it, love it, never smell it on yourself. If you smell fragrance on yourself, it's not for you. I am not a huge fan of the store's layout, sometimes I find the sales associates pushy but then again, I'm pretty darn good on clarifying that I am doing great on my own and will ask questions when I have some. Shawn and Michelle were working there last night and both could not have been more helpful. Michelle played Lady Gaga's Monster for me (special request) and Shawn was uber generous with samples, which I tremendously appreciated.

Big thanks for helping my friend who came with me - she's on a hunt for a signature scent and I told her we should totally visit Bond No 9. She did get her husband a bottle of Wall Street - will he like it? I'll ask. My favorites are definitely Scent of Peace. I love Union Square as well. Used up a bottle of The Hamptons and it was OK.

Our group included a producer for No Reservations and a special guest star from one of the shows, so you can imagine there was a lot of food porn photography to come. Loved the decor right off the bat. It's kind of funky with the netting and all the bottlecaps on the ceiling. Our table looked like an old Diesel can topped with a steel cap. Cool. For drinks we ordered soju, which came served in half of a watermelon. This wasn't really my thing, though, so I ordered a Sapporo too. This was one of those meals where I left the ordering to my frieinds. I know we got bulgogi with mushrooms (OK, not bad) and we also ordered the No. 8 -- which was a type of stew filled with just about everything you can imagine: sausage, ham, vegies, meat, noodles, rice cakes, even spam and cheese. My friends loved it, I *liked* it, but I can be picky and have a thing against cheese so that's no surprise. I must say it was an impressive dish. We kept eating and eating and it never seemed to get any smaller. It just kept oozing around the bowl. Overall, I'd say the food was pretty good but not great.

You can't miss this booth, it has a flat screen TV on it playing the clip of Anthony Bourdin & Kelly Choi's Eat Out NY.

One bite into the lamb burger and it tasted as if I've had this before. I can't put my finger on it, but I think I have a Rachel Ray recipe for the same burger. The flavors tasted too familiar. I give them credit for attempting a burger though. The bun is not your typical bun, I believe it's made of rice flour. It's not the bun you'd get with peking duck either (the man tao).The stewed pork noodle soup was very flavorful, I just wish there was more pork in it and less noodles. The noodles are very fat and thick, I should've ordered the thin ones. The soups come in a large plastic container. Which isn't environmentally friendly but it came in use for me. Since I couldn't finish, I went back to the booth to ask for my lid. The lady who couldn't speak English didn't recognize me and she thought I wanted another Lamb burger (seems that's the only thing she can pronounce). She tried to sell me a plastic bowl for 50 cents, until the other lady who makes the orders recognized me and realized I only wanted a lid. This took about 5 frantic minutes of me hand signing for a lid.

Pretty gals in little green numbers are the waitresses. Pretty hippity-hip people with pretty clothing that is casual but magically draping their pretty bodies perfectly are dining. I see my table with my pretty friends. They make me sit bitch on the banquette, but I am at a table with 4 hot ladies, so I am sitting pretty.The waitress is polite and patient while we chatter and pay little attention to our menus before realizing, oh jeepers, we don't know what the heck we want to eat (how odd, considering we know what we want to drink almost immediately). I peruse the menu, poring over varied options ranging from a scrumptious sounding waffle to cous cous (my friends tell me everybody raves about it, but they disagree) and meatballs. Gitane is, unfortunately, out of a tasty sounding tuna ceviche special.Ordering time and the sky turns dark from an unexpected eclipse whilst pigs sprout wings and take to the sky as I, yes, I -I order a salad.I know, I know. Who am I? A real wildcard, that's what! A rebel! But really the answer is I'm a man who enjoys his veggies but also rarely opts to go for the shrubbery solo. Usually it accompanies some platter of unfortunate creature, but on this rare occasion I had had a late, heavy lunch thus rendering this early dinner unimportant for nourishment purposes - twas merely reinforcement rather than main event.This lucky salad, the anointed one, was arugula with beets, green olives, walnut, apple, and goat cheese croutons (which turned out to be 3 little slices of bread with goat cheese melted on it, not that I'm complaining, I just have issue with it being called a crouton). The dressing was good, not overbearing, and it tasted very clean and refreshing, devoid of the excesses of a good slab of animal. All these little elements complemented one another, a little party of healthy goodness in my mouth, and I was enjoying my fray into this world until I inexplicably stopped.It wasn't because it was bad, it was tasty, it's just that I got bored to the point that I got indifferent and let it inexcusably go to waste. I, platinum card carrying member of the Clean Plate Club, failed to finish a measly salad! I think it's because I ate most of the arugula without getting all the chopped up bits in each bite - this is a skill I have not developed yet. Salad eating is difficult! So then all I was left with was chopped olives and walnuts and apples and it just seemed silly to eat that without the arugula.As for the other foods, the brie with apple appetizer got friend approval. I tried the baked pasta with breadcrumbs, prosciutto, and gorgonzola - basically a heavy, rich mac and cheese. The chicken satay my friend ordered looked, well, sorry. The food isn't bad but it doesn't blow your socks off, granted I wasn't wearing socks anyways 'cause it's the summer and socks are a no-no with my rolled up jeans. My rolled up jeans are a no-no as well, but let's not get into that... Hey! Don't think I don't see you giving me the Manhattan once over!

So I make the detour and traverse this narrow pathway, flanked by barrier/doom to my right and gaudy construction fence to my left.I round a curve and there's the end in sight!

Long flowing locks. Beads of perfumed sweat meandering down remarkably toned arms. Legs like redwoods. My Ebony Goddess is closing in. I notice she isn't moving to her side of the walkway, she is blocking my path. I stop, to allow her to cross in front of me.She gently wraps her arm around my waist, her hand seductively trailing from my hip across my abdomen. I can't hear her sweet nothings as my iPod blares. I am trapped and laughing. She then grasps my left buttock. I do a little hop-step forward.Jeez, at least buy me a drink first?3.5 stars to Gitane, .5 stars to getting groped by a cross-dresser - it could've been more stars, but no payoff after all that build-up...

1353,23,19,4.0,"I swear, we were one beer/song away from making babies in the back booth, because something about the dark lighting, cozy atmosphere, and phenomenal food of The Redhead set off all sorts of hormonal urges within us. We entered early on a rainy Saturday evening and chose to sit at one of the high tables and enjoy cocktails. He had the Gotham, a smoky take on a Manhattan, while I imbibed an Aviation with ease. At the time, the Redhead was mainly filled with patrons at the small wooden bar, talking quietly and making amorous eyes amongst themselves while, like us, waiting for the official dinner service to begin. Thirty minutes later, we sat in a plush, L-shaped booth and got down to business; deciding what to eat. He chose the NY Craft Beer Week pre-fixe, which included 3 courses with their matching NY beers for $40. However, since there was only one pre-fixe menu, I chose to order a la carte and have my meal timed with his. First up was his tarragon, potato, sweetbread soup, with my onion-dip + home cut waffle chips. Now I've never been a big fan of organ meats, but his sweetbreads were like animal candy in my mouf! If this is what I've been depriving myself from for the last 20-some odd years, I'm ashamed. When coupled with the sweet-cream butter on their fresh rolls, his soup was a silken, milky heaven of fresh herbs. Though my fresh onion dip and thick cut chips were also enjoyable. hands down, his soup stole the show. Now, the entire evening, we were singing along with the old-school soul hits by the likes of Al Green, Smokey Robinson, and the Temptations, but once our entrees arrived we hushed all of that and started to sup. I curiously chose the beef tenderloin with polenta and plums, while he had the duck sausage, white beans, and kale-like greens. And oh my gawd, our food was SLAP-YER-GRANDMAW GOOD! The duck, beans-n-greens dish was the perfect fall feast; earthy, soupy, rich, warm, savory...and all served up in a bowl. My tenderloin was like butta, perfectly medium pink and deliciously prepared with a plum-n-onion reduction drizzled over the meat and the fried, yet, gooey polenta fritter that accompanied it. Respectively, we were mouth-fucked by our meats. We finished with a huge slice of German chocolate cake with coconut ice-cream for him, and a delicious ramekin filled with caramel banana pudding for me. Like the proverbial icing on the cake, both desserts were the perfect ending to our lovely meal; his cake was rich and coconutty, with my banana pudding being chock full of Nilla Wafers and with a caramel crust topping. Yes, The Redhead might be a tad small and cramped at peak times, but just like it's namesake hair color, authentic joints (via price, atmosphere, and flavor) like this are rare.",18,0.9981

Beautiful minimalist nature paintings on relaxing moss green walls--- it's like a haiku for the eyes. Wait... haikus are for eyes... I guess it's just like a haiku...How do they NOT use MSG?

Getting pregnant with oxtail. Keeping the baby with oxtail. Having a shotgun wedding with oxtail. Giving birth with oxtail. THE BABY IS BEAUTIFUL. The ""eye of round"" for a real deal pho is supposed to be nearly raw--- this was the case for my dish and I almost cried with gratitude because they got it right.

1356,32,25,4.0,"Walking to this place felt abandoned since the place is on a deserted(?) street having a closed down storefront facade, but stepping into the place thru the side door, it has a whole different air. Well, believe me there is a reason I said ""Air"". Hotel Delmano is filled with Lavender aroma literally, especially the bathroom area. But, It is not just clean air it is somehow intended. For this fact only I would want to give 5 stars. But read on. It was a freezing cold Saturday past midnight. The place was packed but the host was very friendly to find us some spots right away. We ended up at the bar which we would preferred anyways. The decor and style wise, my impression on Hotel Delmano is Pastis/Rains Law Room/Brooklyn Inn. Got it? hmmmm  It reminds me of Pastis or even L'express. Dark wood and leathery, mirrors and antique sinks. Then, Pastis minus French Bistro replaced by the Great Gastby. Then, Rains Law Room posh Hotel lounge without the colorful and flowery Hampton style, replaced by some law room library. And then again, the historic Brooklyn Inn polished and renovated into some Dumbo-ish/West Village style. And finally add the Williamsburg artsy scence. The crowds are definitely mellow and grown ups rather than hipstery Billburgs. The sliding ladder at the bar certainly gives you some library feel not to mention the leather couched table setting exudes the look of young elite social clubs. The drink menus were unique and rare. Even spotted sherries from Jeres/Xeres where is a region of Spain and the sherry is originated. They also had Portos from Portugal. We had some cocktails which were excellent. I had 'Smoke and Flowers' and 'Autumn Leaves'. Bravo~!! for both. The smoke and flowers delivers the smokiness so well that it tasted like smoked salmon without the fishiness and saltiness. The Autumn Leaves did taste(?)/smell like autumn leaves with a hint of maple syrup. However, the prices made the experience all the better. $9-10 drinks when other speakeasies in the city price as $13-15. Jamon and other cheese platters dishes are only $5. Love.... you.......  To me, Hotel Delmano successfully secured its anchor as a new kind of speakeasy(?) bar in the right middle of Williamsburg being a well-mixed cultural prototype of various NYC characters - New with Old, trendy but with class in masculine elegance. In negative sense, Hotel Delmano's glamour could represent mid-level poshness and mannerism to some. but then hey, that's up to you. Highly Recommended.P.S. I lost my ring by leaving near the bathroom sink after washing my hands. It was a gift from a friend of mine so I called several times to ask about it, but only answering machines.

1358,6,8,4.0,"You walk into Scarpetta feeling like you need to be fashionable, trendy, and really really good-looking to eat there. Everyone in there was well-dressed and attractive. So naturally, I fit right in. In all seriousness, places like these feel cold and relatively superficial and usually fail to speak to me. However, the food (for the most part) were utterances of warmth and depth. I especially loved the table bread. There was even one stuffed with cheese and cured meats! (one of the best free table carbs I've ever had). Don't get too full on this though because the portions are quite large. SHARING IS A MUST. Each plate contains enough to serve two, easily. The wonderful thing is, the staff divides each course for you and serves it so. The service was also particularly embracive. Our waiter (whose name I'm ashamed to admit I've forgotten) exhibited sincere concern in regard to every aspect of our meal. Our opinion about each dish was graciously solicited and seemed genuinely valued. He was never too busy to chat about a particular dish, his prior work with Michael White, or the new projects of Scott Conant (check out Faustina).  Food:Polenta with truffle and mushrooms - What everyone else said.Duck foie gras ravioli - best dish of the night for me based on the first few bites (but eating too much of it can get slightly nauseating)Spaghetti with tomato and basil - lived up to the hype. Sounds so boring and simple but Conant transforms this classic into a novel joy.Branzino with winter truffles - BAD. I don't understand what happened here. Not only was the fish bland and uninspired, the truffles had strong hints of what seemed like Chlorox Bleach (at least that's what me and my gf got from it). It rendered the entire dish practically inedible. Was it supposed to taste like that? An acquired taste? An unusual cooking mistake? I really was confused by it. If I really gave this dish its due consideration and weight, it was off-putting enough to spoil the ENTIRE meal and experience. However, I'm choosing to disregard it as best I can, treating it as a forgivable anomaly.Panna Cotta in guava soup, topped with sorbet, and caramelized pineapple - Overly ambitious. The panna cotta itself was perfect. We ended up eating just that. The other components were irritating bells and whistles. I can see how others may find it fun though, but it just wasn't for me.Conclusion:If I'm being honest about this particular meal, this place is 3 stars at best, especially considering how poorly it ended. At 70 dollars per person for food (tax, tip incl., wine not incl.), there is no excuse for a dish like the branzino. I'm giving Scarpetta 4 stars because I'm being stubborn and refusing to give that dish any weight in my rating. The service really made me want to love this place and so damnit, I will love it. But if something like that happens again when I return, you can be sure I won't hesitate to spew Yelptastic crap all over this establishment, regardless of how ridiculously well I fit in as a good-looking person.",8,0.9964

The kale tostadas sprinkled with vegan parmesan cheese had an excellent spicy sauce on them, and the hummus made with red pepper and paprika served with plenty of hot, fresh whole wheat pita and chunks of fresh cucumber and tomato was also a tasty appetizer.

I sat outside with my drink (but no 2 step) and watched as lovers strolled by hand in hand, as kids on skateboards floated by. Mothers with their children, collecting fallen leaves, I remember those art projects, they were always my favorite. I liked to use the red leaves the most. The chill from the night air and the Hudson River brought me back inside. I sat at the bar and didn't have to wait long for another round. The bartender, mixologist really, had wonderful creations for your choosing on the bar menu.

Ok, not really...This place shouldn't go wrong for you. I know plenty of sane and local people with good taste buds that have been coming here for years. The place projects some cleanness compared to many other restaurants on Main St.For breakfast items (btw, they don't start that early in the morning, they open at 9am), they have sweet or salty soy milk. Salty soy milk is hot unsweetened soy milk with little chunks of goodness: dried shrimp, pickled mustard greens,fried shallots, etc.) with some rice vinegar in it which makes the dish semi liquidy because the acid curbs up the soy milk slightly into tofu form. Also sweet chives pan fried pao, salty pancakes with beef slices, white turnip pao.... typing this makes me hungry.Besides breakfast items, most of the items on the menu are also very good and authentic.

This time you will need to remember this: 211E Basement #1... Basement.. very importantYou can breath the ambiance of beautiful clandestinity at the first step. Traditional Japanese decor full of what we all like; noren, bamboo, plants, bright and with an impressive bar decorated with sake bottles all kinds over a shelf covering the wall.Nigori is the sake that I most like, is unfiltered sake resulting in a cloudy drink, the sweatiest, where sometimes you can even taste the rice grains already powdered.. I guess I'm that rustic compare with my friends. Attending my wishes but pleasuring everyone, we order sparkling Nigori.. First time I hear about it; a dark green bottle filled with Sake in 2 separate phases, aqueous in the half top and a milky solution, formed for the rice residues, in the half bottom. Delicately mixed for our ""sake server"" the bottom cloud slowly fused and dominate the aqueous part becoming a uniform white pale liquid served in flute type glasses. It wasn't that rustic at all, right?. The perfect food pairing this sake was suggested in the menu and so we order the Scallop sashimi with mango vinaigrette, a mayonnaise type sauce very tasty that I didn't like. Just personal preferences, tho. But I swear the scallops worth the time I spent draining out the sauce, either in flavor and texture, melting in our mouth in a way that I can't believe it was meat. It takes some time to decide our next Sake round. We decided finally the one that Sakagura just run out that night; it was a limited edition.. among 200 that they have.. great :/ . We were already in love with that Sake; forget about it was impossible; replace it takes a while, ""2 sake servers"", that take it as a challenge, and at least 6 sake shots (maybe more?) until we taste one that satisfied all of us. Most of them was excellent, tho. In the mean time, food was coming, Food that also takes some time to order.. since the menu is not that little and everything sounds amazing. A Maguro Tartar, an Uzaku, a Gindara yuan yak (grilled cod in special soy sauce), a Gyu Miso Nikomi (Shredded Beef Back Ribs stewed in Miso), a Chawanmushi (Steamed Egg Custard) a Yuba shumai (Minced Pork Dumpling) and another half bottle of sake later (plus the shots) we were so happy that we even didn't care about the fact that they forget the tofu that I ordered. They just annulled the order and we were ready for the dessert. Let me say that I loved all the dishes. But that the Uzaku, which is Grilled Eel Vinaigrette Served with Thin Cucumber Slices and Wakame Seaweed and the Maguro tartar, Tuna with yuzu-steeped roe & caviar served over a bed of cucumber slices, juts take my breath away. For dessert we order Black sesame cream brulee and Sea Salt Chocolate ice cream.. as good as it sounds. The cream brulee was as good as the one you get at Cha An and about the sea salt chocolate ice cream, you have to like ""weird"" chocolate. I tasted it before; sea salt truffles are one of my faves; this one was very well balanced with just a touch of saltTo finish this history just 2 things remain to be said,- Atif I, you was right- and.. why not a five? well... 5 means being perfect and among others small things, there was for me 2 main imperfections at Sakagura: 20 min waiting to be seated (even we arrived on time) and that they didn't realize before that our beloved sake was run out However, don't tell anyone else, but I'm not always demanding perfection",26,0.9989

There was no pushing or elbowing despite the fact the place was filled to the brim - only ""Excuse me's"" and ""Go right aheads"". It was almost eerie, actually. It was a pretty mixed and diverse crowd too, which was really nice. So that when the Yankees did finally win, there were hugs all around from the unlikeliest people. The champagne shower (and free flutes of it) that the bartenders gave us was a fitting touch, too.We didn't get to try the food, but we wouldn't have had any place to eat it anyway since we stood for most of the game.

The 1st one: - BCD specializes in soon dubu jigae but you already know this. - Diverse selection of flavors, all MSG free: miso, kimchi, seafood, beef, veggie...etc. - MSG is evil and pulverizes taste buds but you already know this.- The broth was flavorful and the tofu, organic and heaping generous! My bowl was 80% soy. - BCD will bring the hotness to your liking: Plain (zero red pepper) to Zoinks (hark does my tongue burn) - The banchan was standard issue with one exception: a personal fried fish for each diner! (novelty greater than the taste imo) - The kimchi was adequately fermented but note our kakduki was limp with all bend, no snap - Props to the ajooma who replenished banchan supply without request - Non dubu dishes are available but you know better than that - - cough - - people who order hot dogs at Shake Shack...

Its signature dish is called ""soon dubu jigae,"" comprised of soft uncurdled tofu in a salty stew, swimming with nutritious veggies and non-scary proteins like beef or pork or seafood (read: no wuff wuff*). At the base of the menu you'll find red flame markers representing the degrees of spice/heat. If this is your first time eating Korean, I recommend the 1 flamer=mild. When your soon dubu arrives, immediately crack the raw egg into the soup. Don't be afraid - you will not get sick from this. Unless the egg is rotten. Which is probably not the case. Oh! One very important tip. Before your soup arrives, the server will bring 5-7 little dishes of various delights, including the famed fermented red pepper cabbage, or ""Kimchi."" Not only is this our national treasure, but the list of benefits run deep: - chock full of vitamins and minerals! - aids digestion, thanks to two friends: fermentation & fiber - prevents bird flu (according to natives) - cleans your blood (according to mom) - clears sinuses - cures hangover - kills romance (if you're on a bad date i recommend the kimchi + raw garlic combo) Other banchan might include honeyed potatoes, sesame oil broccoli, and fried anchovies..etc. And before you frantically flag down your waitress ""But we didn't order these!"" just relax. These little dishes are FREE!

Any place that can get my mother giddy, serve delicious Colombian/Costa Rican food, and please my grandparents DEFINITELY deserves 4 stars. As usual, the mojitos were fabulous and STRONG, making me quite buzzed after the first. As usual, my mother lied when she said she would only have 1 as we were seated. So predictable...We marched into Bogota, a party of nine, and were seated almost immediately. Fortunately for us they were offering the $23.00 DIne In Brooklyn prix fixe menu. This really made me happy as I knew there would be some appetizers for everyone, plus my very own appetizer and an entree. This is the kind of restaurant where you just cannot choose a single dish. Everything sounds so good. Usually I start whining and moaning because I can't get every single thing I want. The table ordered two empanada samplers, but we only ordered the Colombian empanadas. Fried cornmeal dough around fillings of chicken and potato (I've had better in Queens. Are you surprised?), and black beans and feta. I was convinced it used to be black beans and queso blanco but they were good nonetheless. The appetizer that came with my meal was the Patacon (!!!) con Todo, which is essentially a very large and flat tostone, topped with shredded chicken and steak, covered in shredded queso blanco, and served with guacamole and chimichurri. On this occasion it wasn't fabulous, lacking in the flavor department and was definitely difficult to cut (I think my arms are sore today). It can be a great dish so I hope it's better next time I visit. For my main course I chose the Pollo Sudado, a Colombian chicken stew with potato and yucca, served on rice with a salad on the side. I love stewed chicken, and the texture of this dish was quite good. It was too bad my boyfriend and mother were slurping up their Ajiaco next to me. I had some serious food envy and could hardly focus on the chicken. That or I was already stuffed. It wasn't *fantastic*, but it was cooked well and was very savory. They get points for making some really fluffy rice. Everyone else at our table loved their food. My grandfather adored the Pernil, my father loved the salmon, my aunt (and I!) loved her coconut shrimp. And judging by the way my grandmother (who wasn't hungry...) was picking up everything she could from our plates, she enjoyed it too. The only real minus was the noise.

The benches and rolling chaise lounges are genius, the window over 10th ave is clever and fun, and the main path is lined with old track pieces and random weeds and shrubbery in a very deliberate, but very cool overgrown-train-tracks-in-the-woods motif. The views, obviously, are spectacular. There's only one problem with the Highline that comes to mind, and that is that it is in NEW YORK CITY.

1386,33,41,4.0,"This review is for all the grammar and punctuation nazis who get no love.I am fascinated by the comma. It has endless possibilities of construction and deconstruction. Much before Eats, Shoots & Leaves my English teacher had already taught me how a comma had saved someone's life:Alexander III wrote the death sentence of a prisoner with the words: ""Pardon impossible, to be sent to Siberia."" His wife believed the man innocent. She saved his life by transposing the comma. The sentence then read: ""Pardon, impossible to be sent to Siberia.""Since that day, I have had one motto in punctuation: the comma is my friend. It is always there by your side and doesn't cause the pain a colon or period does. But, use it injudiciously and it can lead to a run-on sentence, and other run-on problems.Extra Virgin Olive Oil.The highest quality and most delicate tasting olive oil. It's better than Fine Virgin, or Pure. My point is not to focus on the chastity spectrum but point out the obvious: there are no commas. Add a comma, and all you have is extra oil - as at L'asso. What superlative pizza, but absolutely marred by the excess oil that not only made the pizza soggy, but downright difficult to eat - aka the 'slip sliding away' syndrome. The tomato sauce is the star of the show: more tart, robust, and spicier than one would expect thereby ably complementing the mozzarella's creaminess. While I like that the crust is thin and has excellent char, I do prefer to eat pizza that displays some spine and must thus fault the crust on this personal preference.The Ace, as the name translates into, would NOT be the service. I had many choice words flash before my mind's eye as the server brought the pizza and appetizers at the same time, but they were instead parts or homophones of the restaurant's name. This was simply sloppy service as I had given explicit instructions to spread them out, having made allowances for error given the predominantly turista customers.Speaking of tourists, I would join the chorus of pizza aficionados that recommend L'asso over Lombardi.

It is very small inside and most of the space that was available to the customers were taken by a huge table in the middle of the place. The people ordering and waiting for their take out and the people sitting at the table might actually get friendlier by a little unintended bump and grind when the place gets packed.When I got there, there was only one person cooking which backed up all the orders but you can't really get mad at him because you could see that he was working his butt off trying to get everyone's order done by himself. Give him a raise because that guy was dedicated. When the second cook finally arrived 15 minutes later (I think he was stuck in the train) and announced that everything would move faster now because there was finally two people cooking, the whole place erupted in cheers and applause.Wanting to try most of the stuff at this place, I ordered the STRAIGHT FRUSH which is $15.50 for any 3 baos, a cup of peanuts and one drink *could be a bottle of beer*. I also heard good things about their Sweet Bao Fries so I added that to the order.At first I was told that they ran out of peanuts and my heart sunk. Then I was told a moment later that they have peanuts again. Whew. Crisis averted. Don't ever scare a hungry Yelper like that again.So how was everything? Does it deserve to be ""Hot on Yelp""? Yes, yes, yes, and definitely yes.. Everything was flavorful.The Hause Bau was soaked to the atom with taste and is so tender that it falls apart. The Chairman Bao's pork belly was so soft, smooth, and buttery. Both of these were served in a freshly steamed bun that is incredibly soft and covered by a wonderful topping of sauces and seasonings. They were incredibly small though so unless you have a stomach the size of a peanut, one would not be enough for a person unless it's a snack.Speaking of peanuts, when they gave me the peanuts they apologized and said somethings in the line of ""Sorry, we ran out of our usually cups so we're putting your peanuts in a Styrofoam bowl instead. It's bigger so we're giving you more peanuts."" No complaints here.The salt and Vinegar Boiled Peanuts were a satisfying side dish. The taste of salt and vinegar in these cold served peanuts were very mildly pleasant. It have been soaked for at least eight hours according to them and i could believe it because it is so soft. The Bao Fries were a surprise. They mentioned that it was sweet but I almost felt like I was eating some kind of candied bread dessert but it has a crunchy exterior and slightly soft interior like real fries. It was so interesting I couldn't stop eating it. There was an alternative sauce for the fries which they mentioned have a spicy kick. Some of you might know of my love for spicy stuff so I was very interesting in trying this sauce. Too bad they ran out of this tonight. Next time.The juice they have here is a must try even if it does come in a can. I had the mango flavor and it tasted just like drinking a perfectly ripe mango in liquid form. I need to find out where they sell them by the box full.When I come back(and I do plan to come back) I am dragging some of my other friends here just to show them that there are such good and interesting food around the area.

What followed was a massacre. I destroyed that box of chicken. The fries were killer, the chicken was off the chain, and the pickled radishes were a perfect complement. I saved a wing for my friend who works next to me, he eats entirely too much fried chicken, he agreed the chicken was awesome, and that tomorrow he'll take a day off Chicken House and try BonChon for himself.Visiting BonChon is kinda like flying these days.. you're prolly going to end up waiting a bit more than you'd like, but once you get to where you're going, this fried chicken tastes like vacation.

The couple in front of us, lets say ""Ari"" and ""Suzie"" ordered 2 drinks and the Grilled Pizzetta which I didn't try but that smelled delicious and it didn't produce other that a pleasant gesture on them. Suzie and Ari were trying to find out if we were having a second date, since they could detect high attraction and certain seduction game (Ari), or a third date (Suzie) since it looked to her that there was also a lot of confidence and complicity between us, a sign of more frequent encounters. ""I think they have even been together for 1 month already"" is what she said when we all were talking about it a bit later. Yes, I met Suzie and Ari that night at the table since they were seated there right after us .. and we socialize with them and we had a pleasant and funny conversation about gender differences and in fact a correspondence between each one ideas and gender; with me being agree with Suzie and my friend being agree with Ari. That you will be seated with others at the same table looks to be the regular behaviour at Stanton Social since it happen to me a few months later when I was back with a friend, a girl this time, to have again a drink since I liked the ones that I had that day back when I met Ari and Suzie . If you like this or not depends of different factors; you, your mood, who is your companion, how are the others (remember that you don't choose them.. they are imposed). I have to say that I liked both times. Even the first one; it was really funny. You can always stay in the bar area, tho; which it was my intention the second time but we couldn't get an spot. The crowd at Stanton Social was in a range from middle twenties to late thirties; it was older during the week. It was always nice and is easy to socialize if you want. Either the hostess, which I never could find out her name, as well as Nikki, our waitress was extremely nice and professionals. Designed by AvroKo, the team that some of you already know I'm crazy about, you can't other than expect a beautiful space. Stanton Social is sexy, trendy, soft lights but not dark, more like glowing in gold, with botanical painted in the walls, and leather sofas. The tables can easily accommodate groups of 6 to 8 people. There is groups of female/male friends playing gender games. Its also a place to bring a date. The drinks menu offer from wines to cocktails that was always my selection. The combinations are interesting. Among the ones that I tried, I highly recommend the Pineapple 75 Martini and mostly the Basil-Lime Gimlet a mix of Belvedere vodka, muddled basil leaves, lemon syrup and fresh lime juice. I also tried the Cranberry Flower and the Bea's Gin-Lemon Mojito. It wasn't as good but still I enjoyed it as well. Fresh ingredients/herbs is a characteristic in all the drinks. Said this and having clear that I enjoyed the ambiance, somehow I'm not very excited about the place. Its loud, the music wasn't very good, not bad either, and I didn't feel like socializing with the groups I saw. But it could be that particular night. Also, they are too generous with the ice in the drinks and so it gets cold and the flavor gets diluted soon which I really don't like. But still; if I'm in the area I'll definitely come back. And I'll order again the Basil-Lime Gimlet. I still remember the scents of the fresh basil. I also wanna try the food at the restaurant, downstairs. I took a look to the menu on line and I got really excited about it. French Onion Soup Dumplings... In between, Ari was right. It was a second one in fact.",19,0.9992
1395,22,17,4.0,"Moving for most people is a defining moment of mental and physical fortitude. Many choose to rent a truck, seek assistance from family and friends and use pizza and beer as currency. Hours later, some relationships are strained because of the long hours, inability to transport heavy items through narrow doorways and quick fatigue (many of us are out of shape). In previous moves, it was the bane of my existence, whether it was for moving a friend, a family member or myself. Time Out New York listed this vendor as the most efficient out of the 4 suggested NYC moving companies [newyork.timeout.com/arti…. I had their undivided attention.I called a handful of moving companies and did my comparison shopping. Although I got a few quotes (which were cheaper), I was sold by the estimator (Nick) would came on site to see everything (no obligation to accept the bid). This was to avoid any discrepancies on the final bill. We agreed to a flat rate plus and hourly rate for packing the kitchen.On the scheduled moving day, the guys came in a truck, scouted my apartment and went to work. My movers were Tim (foreman), Clive and Carlos.All Star Movers' tagline should be ""we are the silent sherpas"". These guys handled a 2 bedroom move... from a 2 floor walkup in the Bronx, moving to a 5 floor walkup in Manhattan. These dudes were serious when they carried my stuff up the 5 flights. Mind you, the only thing I could compare them to are the porters who run up and down Machu Picchu (Peru) with the tourist bags (ie 3x their body weight) on their backs. These guys were impressive.I was also impressed with the packing skills of the wardrobes boxes (I believe 25 boxes are included) and the kitchen. As my wife unpacked, she noted that the plates, cups, utensils, etc were securely packed and organized; this made it easier for us.One problem I will note was that I was told that to save money (man per hour and travel time) that I should get three guys in the Bronx. In Manhattan, if there were guys (on other jobs available) they would assist the Manhattan gratis to expedite the move. Unfortunately this did not happen. I almost felt bad for the movers, but these guys never complained one peep or grimaced (a lot of sweat, though). One of them would sing and the other two would make jokes. Lunch and drink breaks were kept to a minimum (this was by their choice, not by my orders). The movers wanted to finish the job as efficiently as possible. I know that if I were in an elevator building (or less stairs) the move would have been completed quickly (I have a lot of stuff).There was no damage on my furniture and other stuff upon final inspection so I am very happy with their service.I paid a premium for All Star Movers but overall they were an excellent choice. You get what what you paid for. I highly recommend and will summon them again, when it's time to move out. *groan*Thank you All Star Movers!IFHTP 1",25,0.9548

The idea of hearing my favorite and not so favorite songs butchered by drunks was not appealing. I'm not twelve, I didn't need to jump around and play rock star and let's be honest....... I thought I was too damn cool for karaoke.... until I found myself belting out KISS & Bowie tunes with a big ass smile on face and realizing something real important..... THIS IS FUN.My experiences at Sing Sing have been very good. I've only done private rooms during the week so can't comment on the bar area or the scene on weekends. The sound system is pretty good, they have a wide ranging selection of (american) music and the staff was quick to refill drinks. Once we had a problem with the sound system and was given a comped pitcher of beer, so no qualms with service.The rooms can be a bit small, so go with people you don't mind being close to. It's also easy to lose track of time and stay too long which can add up ($$). While it's not cheap, the good times had here are worth it.Being an adult is overrated.

1398,12,7,4.0,"Not only do I love the taste of lobster, I love the process of dismantling one. It just makes the meat taste that much better because you really had to work for it. I am not shy about digging and picking at every possible crevice in the body. I don't mind lobster in my hair or getting a lobster facial either. If you don't splatter some lobster on your shirt, then it probably means you've missed some valuable meat somewhere.With that said, I have to thank Waterstone Grill for allowing me to indulge in this particular favorite pastime of mine...all for the low price of $19.95 for 1.5 lbs of Maine lobster!  And it really is a bargain considering how good the lobster is. It even comes with shoestring fries. Shoestring fries for a shoestring budget - gotta love it. Every Tuesday night they offer this special. You know what else you get on Tuesday nights? Half-priced bottles of wine from 4-9pm. Add an order of lobster mashed potatoes (yes, with little chunks of lobster!) that are perfectly fluffy and buttery, and you're all set. The four of us each had the lobster special, and split the wine and mashers. The grand total, including tax & tip? A mere $132, or $33 per person. And we left a good tip!I'll say that the service was deserving of the tip, too. Our waiter was diligent about replacing our discard bowls, and was friendly at the start. He assured us all that the lobster special was very good, and obviously we weren't disappointed.Lastly, I have to thank Jen N. for putting together our little lobster night. Without her, I would have missed out on this fantastic deal. That was one terrific, meaty, sweet, and delicious lobster! I'll definitely be back for more.",16,0.9934
1399,17,16,4.0,"I'm a firm believer of the theory that states that 95% of what it takes to get in shape is just getting to the gym. If I can find a reason not to go, I won't. And with the NYSC almost a 15 minute walk from my house, I wasn't going nearly as often as what it took to make me feel good. I know it makes sense to, y'know, walk to a place where I'm trying to exercise but I've learned it's easier to work with my mind instead of fighting against my idiosyncrasies.I've walked by this gym for a year now, and even went in for a tour once, but joined recently when I came to the conclusion going 15 minutes was just too far. When I went in to tour it a year ago, I thought it was alright, but now they've got a bunch of new machines (four of those new fancy treadmills with the ipod connectivity) and are planning to add a bunch over the next few months.Upstairs is your cardio (with tons of treadmills and bikes) and your nautilus machines with a plethora of flat screen televisions tuned to all sorts of different stations (including one with the closed-circuit camera of the babysitting room which is an idea so incredibly full of common sense that it amazes me it's taken this long to think of it) while the four new treadmills have tv built in. I always thought I'd hate running on a treadmill that didn't have a tv built in, and it's not my favorite, but it turns out that it makes it harder to stare at the clock.They even have an iPod charger for when your iPod (read: my iPod) is so done and busted that it can barely keep a charge longer than 30 minutes. Imagine that -- people at a gym use portable music devices because listening to the sound of feet thudding on a treadmill is only so interesting. Shocking!Downstairs are the free weights, lockerrooms and training class area -- they have a full training class schedule which are all free as part of your membership. And speaking of membership, it's a gym so they're flexible on payment options. I managed to get the membership fee waived by paying the first two months up front (I chose the month-to-month payment plan, $10 more per month than the year long plan though I can switch later on if I want to) and I can cancel my membership, no questions asked, with just 30 days notice.It's amazing how much changes (membership costs $69 per month here, $59 for the year-long version) in the six blocks from ""Park Slope"" to ""South Slope"" -- it's $30 per month lower than the NYSC and Harbor Fitness has a smoothie/juice drink bar in the front of the gym, which is a nice touch if I don't want to walk up to the 7-11.The overriding benefit, though, is that they are open 24 hours a day from Monday - Friday, closing only on Saturday and Sunday nights, which is fine, because chances are I'm not working out at 3 a.m. on a Saturday. I didn't think it would make much of a difference, but knowing it's open at 10:30 if I get home late, makes it much harder to avoid going.It saddens me to think I've been missing out on this place, which is on my street, for a year because of my love of integrated television.

My friend said I could come here and get a First Review. I said I wouldn't, because it'd take me a few visits before I had enough appetizers and entrees under my belt to get a complete grasp of the place and undoubtedly someone would get to it before me -- but, out of nowhere, two of my friends invited me out to dinner tonight, asking if I knew anywhere new that looked promising, and I suggested Agua Dulce -- we had about a dozen dishes between the three of us and thus I feel secure enough in my knowledge of the overall experience to write a review -- and, yet somehow, even though they've just started serving the public a few hours ago, somebody got a review in before me... 5 days ago?! But I'm not bitter, no way, not me.This place easily wins the spot for my favorite Spanish-based (as in from Spain, mostly) restaurant in Hell's Kitchen -- although, in my opinion, there isn't much serious competition -- it's absolutely beautiful inside, the service is incredibly attentive and friendly, and lots of attention was paid to decorating both the bar and the main seating-area, and surprisingly it's even rather pleasant and attractive outdoors (which is a big compliment coming from me -- I normally can't stand eating ""al fresco"" in NYC, with all the congestion and pollution).We started with:-- House-made guacamole with fresh tortilla chips.-- Assorted grilled marinated vegetables.-- Assortment of Spanish cheeses and cured meats.-- Patatas Bravas with garlic aioli with smoked paprika.We continued with:-- Crispy sweetbreads with grapefruit and fennel.-- Galician octopus with smoked paprika and olives.-- Spicy fried shrimp empanadas.-- Yellow-fin tuna tiradito with lychee/mint salsa.We finished with:-- Grilled calabaza stuffed poblano peppers with romesco sauce.-- Mixed seafood stew with coconut milk and cashews.-- Smoked tea braised beef short ribs with grilled string beans.-- Saffron rice with grilled chicken and chorizo.We ordered more than half of the dinner menu, all at the beginning of the meal, otherwise we most likely wouldn't have ordered so much food... We were expecting everything to be ""tapas style"" which is so fashionable nowadays -- it seems that somehow most people think that's all Spanish food consists of, just like in the minds of most Americans all that the Japanese ever eat is Sushi -- but the portions were all rather generous, all three of us left extremely full, even after spreading the evening out over a three-hour time-span...

Some people have their bar mitzvah, I had my day at brooks brothers...a rite of passage that every man should have...I wore that suit proudly...and when another younger student needed a suit for an interview for medical school, it was that suit he wore as I handed off one of my prized possessions so that it could have new life...The madison avenue store is not just a destination, it is a way of life...sometimes I go in there and shop and just think im in a music video...winks...hey sexy...I'm Gonna Make A Change,For Once In My LifeIt's Gonna Feel Real Good,Gonna Make A DifferenceGonna Make It Right . . .As I, Turn Up The Collar On Myfavorite brooks brothers Coat (Double-Breasted Trench Coat $798)This look Is Blowin' My MindI See The Men from Wall Street,With Not Enough To Eat (Damn Subprime, the market, and Bailouts)Who Am I, To Be Blind?Pretending Not To SeeTheir NeedsWith subtle Disregard,I put a Non-Iron Shirt on Top (50% off this week)With a cool Man's Soul     We Follow their prices OnThe Net Ya' Know'Cause I Know just whereTo GoThat's Why I Want You ToknowI'm flirtin With a girl InThe MirrorI'm tellin you this clean cutstuff paysAnd no suit store could haveBeen Any betterIf You Wanna Make your selfA sexier faceJust buy a nice suit, Andyour luck will Change(Na Na Na, Na Na Na, Na Na,Non-Iron)I've Been A Victim Of A SelfishKind Of LoveIt's Time That I RealizeThat There Are Some With NoHome, Not A Nickel To LoanCould It Be Really Me,Pretending That They're NotAlone?A cashmere winter scarf,Nice tie above my HeartIm a business woman's DreamThey Follow The Pattern OfThe Wind, IntervieweesCause They Got No PlaceTo BeThat's Why she's flirting WithMeI'm flirtin With a girl InThe MirrorI'm tellin you this clean cutstuff paysAnd no suit store could haveBeen Any betterIf You Wanna Make your selfA sexier faceJust buy a nice suit, Andyour luck will Change(Na Na Na, Na Na Na, Na Na,Non-Iron)I'm flirtin With a girl InThe MirrorI'm tellin you this clean cutstuff paysAnd no suit store could haveBeen Any betterIf You Wanna Make your selfA sexier faceJust buy a nice suit, Andyour luck will Change(Na Na Na, Na Na Na, Na Na,Non-Iron)& She's Flirting With The Man InThe Mirror,(Man In The Mirror-OhYeah!)but she's doing it indifferent Ways(Better Change!)No Message Could HaveBeen Any Clearer(If You Wanna Make yourWorld A Better Place)(abandon the Gap AndThen Make The Change)(You Gotta Get It Right, WhileYou Got The Time)('Cause When You Close YourHeart)You Can't Close Your . . .YourMind!(Then You Close Your . . .Mind!)That Man, That Man, ThatMan, That ManWith That Man with the nice suit( Oh Yeah!)That Man, That Man, That ManI'm Asking Him To ChangeHis shoes(Better Change!)You Know . . .That ManNo Message Could HaveBeen Any ClearerIf You Wanna Make your WorldA Better PlaceTake those kiddy clothes off AndThen Make A ChangeHoo!

If you're familiar with the city, you'll find food carts, especially at night, specializing in regional dishes throughout the archipelago. Known as ""kaki lima"" or five feet, these kiosks grant you delicious choices: satay ayam, gado-gado, siomay, bakso, You name it, they might have it. Well the same goes with Mie Jakarta. Except, your stomach will be kind to you and you'll save a plane ticket getting there. The place holds about 20 diners in a pinch and the service is quick. Our group of three chose mie complit with bakso (meatball soup) along with a pot of tea. Our waitress soon came back with two bowls for each diner. The larger bowl contained ramen noodles, chopped mustard greens, bean sprouts, fried tofu, and fried wontons. The meatball soup lay aside in the smaller container. One can combine the two or eat separately. NO RULES IN MIE JAKARTA. Eat as you please.I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the siomay or beef rendang. *sigh* Udah kenyang = already full.",20,0.9601

Fortunately, if by ""mission,"" you mean getting several rounds of free drinks...well, we'd only just begun!Arriving around 9 on a Monday, EO was bustling on with a mix of regulars, fashion-types and suits, all clamoring for bar seats. With good reason -- the drinks are slammin' and the staff super nice (hi, Dev! :-) In addition to drinks, we sampled (and I mean stuffed ourselves) with some ""bone marrow poppers"" and steak tartar. Oh, how I love fancy food for carnivores, and the guys prepare the tartar before your very eyes, so your salivation gland goes into overdrive. Back to the sweet staff -- these gents loved dishing with us about their favorite drinks, ingredients, syrups, etc. My second favorite booze-related activity is talking about it, so this was all good.With our newfound camaraderie established and reviewer roles outed, more and more drinks began coming our way. ""Try this one...oh wait...now try it with gin instead!"" After a few more rounds, rational thought made one valiant last effort to prevail and we decided to bow out with livers intact...until we were stopped by a shot of JD...and then another! Of course, the steak bone's connected to the bourbon bone, so we were obliged to partake before stumbling home.And now, your mission, should you choose to accept it:1. (Background info.)

1414,20,10,4.0,On a very cold snowy day like today. There was nothing else better to have than a good bowl of hot soup. a hearty one. Didn't have any breakfast nor lunch earlier so while still seated on my dentist chair I already have my mind fixed into heading to this hand drawn noodle place once I was done. Ordered their House special soup which is a combination of all the different kinds of meat with noodles and vegetables. So delicious.. It was that good and I still can't believe I finished the whole bowl. Camille stuck with her diet and just ordered Dumplings soup to go.It was also fun watching the chinese lady make the noodles from scratchpulling the dough into strings until it becomes thin ..ready to be dumped  into the pot of boiling soup ...add vegetables ..and poured into the bowl......this was not new to me ...I used to watched them make it in Hongkong way back when I was still living in Kowloon...The marketplace was2 blocks from where I use to.llive and order some on my way home from work. . Saves me the time cooking my own food. ..Those were the days....My only regret I should have learned how to do it...who knows...I probably open up my own soup and dumpling place.  I guess its not too late isn't it...,19,0.8097

At least this time, I have a seamless Alibi to carry out my wicked deeds.This is the only place where I can get drunk and kill things. Unfortunately I'm talking about shooting animals on the big screen in Big Game Hunter, but that should satisfy my bloodlust for the moment. I think $6 to take out digital panthers, elk, musk ox, and adorable elephants is way cheaper than a psychiatrist's bill and less humiliating than a life sentence. The hot chicks that flash in between rounds definitely make the time pass quicker. Don't expect astounding service from the bar. Just order up and quit your whining. Watch out when you pass by the pool table as well. As friendly and outgoing as our resident poolsharks get, they will tear you a new hole if you mess up their shot. Serious hustling goes on in the pay-per-game billiard table. Speaking of hustling, there is definitely some pimping and ho'ing that goes down in these neck of the woods.

1420,27,25,4.0,"I was a bit late (10 min) for the reservation because I was outside of plain midtown builing waiting for my friends, texting and calling but no replies. I decided to just go down but the basement looked a bit too much like a boiler room.... No wonder no phone receptions... But walking in, I see my party still waiting for the table and some lively steaming food scenes going on and stomach awakening aromas kicked my nostrils. Suddenly the hostess asked for my coat to check and apologized for our wait. It was packed but her apology and the immediate well-manner made up for it.The place is dimly lit but cozy. I like the Chrysanthemum flower arrangemenet on our table. The whole place is colored like bamboo and brown rice papers - even the flowers. The menu books were nicely hard covered and thick. I like the fact that the sake menu had a map of Japan with name of regions written so that we can relate with where the sakes are from since the sakes are mostly categorized by the regions. We had some sparkling unfiltered wine as a starter but I was not so fond of it. it was a bit felt like 3 layered notes than balanced. There was one of sakes that I was just wanting to try. it was listed in limited edition page decribed to have baked apple note. We got to taste before we buy the bottle($82) and we all absolutely loved it. But the waiter came back and said that the last bottle has been just used. arhhhhhhh.......... From then on, we were constantly suggested to try different sakes until we found our choice. All the staffs are Japanese and seemed natives as well. They were knowledgeable about sakes, not to mention having some pride in the culture. Foodwise, it certainly was home-cooking. Mostly I feel dishes were mildly seasoned but so fragrant and well balanced. I personally think that it is their seasoning soy sauce/vinegar. They probably had their own soy sauce but vinegretted. It means it is not from Kikoman bottle... LOL Korean call this ""Jang-Maht"" literally meaning - Soy Sauce Taste where the food of the house or place depends on soy sauce of the house since traditionally every home brew their own soy sauce/vinegar in Asia. For example, the grilled Eel came with pickled fresh cucumber slices and also marinated with seaweed and cucumber sliced.. the marination was simple, the vinegretted soy sauce or some aged vinegrette. I could taste this sauce in many other dishes. I assume that the soy sauce or vinegrette is from aged pickled juice - Korean called this ""Jang-Ah-Chi"", which such as garlic, plum/apricot (Umeboshi), Dai-kon and etc get pickled in the mixture of simmered and cooled down water, soy sauce. vinegar and sugar or syrup. Therefore, even without much addition, the whole dish has mysterious savoriness and is whole. I love love this cucumber slices and it cleanses your mouth between dishes very well but also it mixes very well with sakes. Apparently, my appetite went skyrocked and I went to Asian market(Han-Ah-Reum) to buy some garlic Jang-Ah-Chi ($2.99) today. The first dish was scallop sashimi with mango sauce but the mango sauce was so rich that almost tasted like Uni(Sea Urchin). The tuna tartare was excellent and I could not stop eating wanting more, not to mention the beautiful plating. I wasn't so crazy about the pork Shu-mai which was A OK. Grilled Black Cod got high marks on the texture. The dessert, the black sesame creme buree was the star. The puree was very creamy and delicious not being overly rich goes so well with the ice cream - oh so heavenly. However, Nah for the sea salt chocholate. It was way to salty and the salty kicks were so intense even to the degree of surprise.Since we had tried so many sakes before we made our choice (trials were only 6 sakes!!) top of our two bottles, we got all very tipsy. One of our tipsy friend went to the bathroom and came back so excited with the bidet buttons. I am sure he must had some good time in there playing with it. hahahaAll nicely food and wined, each spent about $70 each. The hostess already grabbed my coat, waiting to help me put on while I was hehe with my friends a little buzzed. Good life, good food - I promised them that I would be back soon.",31,0.9994

Alas, I decided it was best not to date any of them. A few weeks passed and I returned to Drop Off Service to enjoy a nice glass of Delirium and an amazing juke box.

1423,19,16,4.0,"Come autumn, all I want to do is drink beer in the West Village. It has that glamorous, bohemian, ""New York"" feeling, that i'm-wasted-in-a-cozy-sweater feeling. That I-could-be-a-great-writer-if-i-really-tried feeling. So after two weeks of eating healthy and avoiding alcohol, I decided to cash in big time at Corner Bistro with my favorite dining partners: me, myself, and I.The crowd at 3pm on a weekday is old and haggard, with a smattering of GQ types and a few foodie tourists. I sat down at one of the ancient wooden tables, carved with various symbols and the names of previous customers, and promptly ordered a Cheeseburger ($6) and French Fries ($2.75). I read about a page of my book in peace, wondering whether I should've gone for the gold (McSorley's for $2.75) when my order magically appeared in front of me. The burger was huge eight-ouncer, with a familiar, juicy, homemade taste.The onions snapped off like broken rubber bands after the first bite, but they were raw, so no big loss there. On the other hand, the fries were pretty terrible and McDonald's-esque, with an aftertaste that sent me scrambling for the nearest dessert. But that burger and the calm, dark, autumnal atmosphere gave me such a great feeling that I really couldn't care less about the bummer frites.

1424,21,20,4.0,"I'm glad something came out of a pointless, four-year relationship... the discovery of this Filipino eatery. Krystal's is a staple within the Filipino community in Queens. Any time is a busy time coming to this place b/c although there are competing Filipino restaurants within the neighborhood (actually some on the same street), you will be hard-pressed to find a better and more authentic place than Krystal's. The location is prime.. although there's not many options for parking, if you are a straphanger, just hop off the 7 train at 69th Street Fisk station and Krystal's is literally right on the corner. Prices here are pretty cheap and you get a good amount of food. If you're a dieter and looking for healthy fare, this might not be the wisest place to patronize. Filipino cuisine though varied, is mainly known for their love of fried foods. There's the typical breakfast plates (garlic fried rice, a fried egg, and your choice of a cured meat... ""tocino"" or ""longinsa"" (both pork, and very tasty), or fried milk fish. But really, one could have this type of meal any time of the day. My particular favorite dish... which I inevitably always end up ordering each time I come here, is a noodle dish called ""pancit palabok""... poolee noodles sauted in a rich and creamy fish-based sauce, toosed with shrimp and pieces of bacon and a sliced, hard-boiled egg. I just had it over the weekend and it never disappoints me. I also really like this vegetarian dish, ""laing"" which is a medley of spinach and taro leaves (i think), cooked in coconut milk. Ahhh, that's good!! Other famous filipino dishes are ""kare-kare"" which is something I will probably never try since it's got ox tail in it.. but my friend seemed to have enjoyed it very much when he had it.. also there's ""dinuguan"" which is a stew made with pork's blood... I myself have never tried it and probably won't, but this is a Filipino staple and I was told many filipino children are scammed into eating this by adults who say it's ""chocolate soup"".. pretty funny (but a little cruel, haha).. Ok, a few other dishes worth nothing.. a delicious tamarind broth soup called ""sinigang"", which is made with pieces of pork, eggplant, string beans and is a little sweet and sour.. the soup base is a clear broth, and tastes great when you mix it up with some rice. Filipino BBQ is also very good. Try their skewered items. Lastly, you must have some of their desserts. Krystal's has an enormous variety of cakes, cookies and even drinks. Some suggestions.. ""halo-halo"" which is a dessert drink (but you eat it with a spoon?!) containing a medley of different things in it... shaved iced, pieces of lychee or jackfruit... red bean, jelly, etc. also, their flan is pretty amazing..! Beware though, it's quite decadent. The decor of Krystal's is pretty bare bones.. casual and not really anything special. There are some knick-knacks on the walls and shelves pertaining to filipino culture that is interesting, but aside from that, and the one framed photo of some of the staff beaming next to an exuberant mayor mikey bloomberg (find this behind the counter), it's just a very simple, but pleasant space. They've recently added a huge flat screen tv, which is a little bit on the obtrusive side, being that it's mounted high above the wall.. however, the filipino variety shows being displayed definitely adds some flair and entertainment value to the entire ambiance. Yes, there's a second floor, but I think that's for buffets and I've never gone there for that purpose before.. so no useful comments concerning this.. je suis desole. Hmmm, now I am feeling a rumble in the tummy and methinks I should pick up some Sinigang sometime this week! Btw, I am really glad to see that more non-filipinos are discovering Krystal's.

1427,18,15,4.0,"I just started a new job this week, and to welcome me, my mentors took me out to lunch. What with this arthritic economy, I was expecting something closer to Wahoo's Fish Tacos than Le Bernardin, but no one's complaining besides my tum, and even she's secretly happy.The space is beautiful. Elegant, open, and I imagine when the lights turn down for dinner, it would be glowing and romantic. The service is great. We were helped by a waiter with a real live French accent who took us through the menu and checked on us frequently without once crossing over and becoming solicitous.The prix fixe at lunch is actually something of a deal. (I know, spoken like someone who's just been treated to Le Bernardin.) For $68 you get three courses, and as there is no non-prix-fixe option, you have the full menu available for each course. Additionally, the salmon rillette with flatbreads is a course of its own, and a choice of at least five varieties of bread means there's just no way you're leaving hungry.The rillette with flatbreads is fantastic, thought-out and flavorful, bearing almost no relation to your standard bread basket. It's also utterly addicting. I spread it on flatbreads, then on bits of rosemary baguette that I pawned from the bread tray, which also bore me some bomb walnut-raisin.Overwhelmed by the number of appetizing options on the menu, I begged our server for guidance. With his help, I ordered the yellowfin tuna over foie gras and toasted bread with olive oil and chives, the striped bass and langoustine entree with confit tomato agnolotti, bouillabaisse consomme, and curry emulsion, and the hazelnut dessert with gianduja cream, Oregon hazelnuts, honey, bruleed banana, and brown butter ice cream.The tuna and foie gras appetizer was a little disappointing. It looked so promising in print, but the dish itself just wasn't exciting. The quality of the ingredients was evident, but none of the ingredients helped the others shine. The flavors were too subtle and there was perhaps an overabundance of oil. I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it, but neither did I finish it, and neither would I order it again.The bass-langoustine dish, though, was amazing, just stupidly delicious. First of all, I'm a huge sucker for table-side presentation. The pouring of the consomme, the drizzle of curry butter sauce on top - I was like a kid at a magic show, only happier, because I was about to eat the magic. And oh it was good. The bass was cooked to a ""T"" so fine you could use it to split hairs. But what made the dish wasn't the perfect technique, but rather the perfect assembly of disparate ingredients. Ripert seems to do a lot of this sort of culinary DJ'ing, and the results were simply gorgeous in this little bowl. The texture of the langoustine paired with the bass was exquisite, and the tiny bursting agnolotti kicked it all to high heaven. The soothing consomme with the deep dark spice of curry was so good I'd buy it in mouthwash form.The dessert brought the meal back to this planet. Another ensemble cast, but this one boasted far less chemistry. It was yummy, sure, but I won't remember it for long. The dessert was also just too tiny for that many components. It was impossible to guess at what Ripert would've suggested as constituting a bite. I've seen similar ingredients come together with orgastic results before - in Momofuku Milk's banana cake - so I don't doubt that it can be done, but perhaps on a bigger canvas. And may I suggest salt? For all the stuff on the plate, there wasn't anything more complex than sweet and tasty. Even the brown butter ice cream fell short of its flavor promise.With the dessert came a napkin bearing gifts of tiny round green pistachio and pillowy golden almond Madeleines. They were bite-sized with that lovely light-cake texture - a delightful little cap to a delightful lunch.Overall, my experience at Le Bernardin wasn't transcendent, but it was fantastic and I would be absolutely thrilled to go again. If every course had been as good as the entree, the lunch would've been astounding. I imagine if I were a rich New York housewife, I would dine here often, learn the choicest picks, and have my socks knocked off at every visit. I have to say, though - having a job isn't so bad either.",24,0.9985

The space is enormous and has a beautiful rooftop with an incredible view and a eight person hot tub. I guess due to the recession, people aren't shelling out $5,000 dollars a night so they had to do something with the space.

As soon as you step out the elevator on the twentieth floor, you are in awesome party that seems to get better each floor. The first floor was packed with a great looking crowd on the dance floor and a packed bar. The second floor was more like a lounge with comfortable couches and a small bar. The rooftop is the main draw with it's previously mentioned hot tub and view. There were a couple of girls who just took off there dresses and got into the tub which made the scene even hotter until some drunk jerk got completely naked and jumped in the tub as well.

Mario loved his village, and wanted to give the gift of good Italian food to everyone.But giving good food to the village wasn't easy. You see, there was an evil monster called the Darden Restaurant Group (NYSE: DRI) that had invaded the lands to the north, and had a weapon called the Olive Garden ""$9.95 Never Ending Pasta Bowl"", which had warped the hearts and minds of the neighboring town. Those people thought that Italian food meant wilted fettucine with gloopy alfredo sauce or 'herb grilled salmon'.But Mario had the wisdom and courage to set the villagers straight and serve a dish of house marinated sardines, 'fishy' flavored, but delightfully so. ""Ho ho!"" he exclaimed, ""try my octopus with sorrel and my platter of house cured charcuterie!"" The villagers did and they loved it (especially the headcheese from the charcuterie platter).And Mario smiled upon the villagers, and showered them with a savory and unctuous Bucatini Alla' Amatriciana and a suitably delicate, almost fluffy, skate with sweet corn. The villagers danced in the street, drunk from the bottles of barolo and dolcetto, chosen for them by the excellently informed waitstaff.Though Mario's food was excellent, he tested the villager's nerve and patience, by making them wait (over an hour) to eat his food. And due to the sheer enthusiasm of his guests, Mario's restaurant became quite crowded and very loud. But the villagers understood that good food requires a little suffering, and all was right with the world.Thanks to Mario and his restaurant, the villagers were able to avoid the tyranny of the Darden Restaurant Group, and lived happily ever after.",24,0.9934

Better specials!""It was ""Ladies' Night,"" but apparently I'm not that pretty because only Preeti got her drinks for half off. Lame. But head's up to tha females: Tuesday night is your jam. And you will love it. $3-$4 drinks? Who can refuse? They're DELICIOUS too.Preeti let me take a sip of her Mambo Fresa, a refreshing strawberry margarita, but I went with the Macho Mojito first.* Loved it, but who am I to discriminate? I had to try something else, so I went for the Mango Jalapeno Caipirinha. The bartender promised the jalapeno wasn't overwhelming, but provided just the right kick. Mission Accomplished. But one jalapeno drink is enough for me. I moved on to the Playa Sangria, opting for red. It just made sense considering I've never been in a place quite like Cabana except for the time I went on a Caribbean cruise. Cabana Bar is a beach washed ashore on Presidente St and 5th Ave. It's completely white-washed, so that it even brightened our rainy evening. I can only imagine what it looks like in sunny daylight. I can practically feel myself getting skin cancer.And then, toward the end of the night, the most glorious thing happened. Something that I hope and pray for every time I go out**. We got a drink on the house. Probably because we were the only ones there for most of the night. In our three hours there, only one other couple came in for drinks, even though the bartender claimed Tuesday nights were more hoppin'. Maybe it was the rain, or maybe it gets more crowded after 10. Who knows, but I kind of like monopolizing a place to myself.

It is. $19.95 for unlimited sangria and quesadillas. Worth it.)Now, about that dream of becoming a cabana boy . . . __________* Because if I'm not pretty enough, the next best thing is ordering something with ""Macho"" in the title, as I am clearly 100% all macho man.** I'm sad, lonely, poor, and possibly exhibiting classic signs of a destined alcoholic.",11,0.9956

Usually, We venture south to Our empire's more familiar territories. But in this case, the Queens in question did Their homework, and booked a cozy table for four at Bar Centrale.Nestled unmarked and upstairs from a bustling Joe Allen's (in the heart of Restaurant Row), few would suspect this little lair of Broadway talent. After a friendly greeting and prompt seating (We thought We saw a genuflect, but it may have been a napkin-pickup), We began to read through the menu -- a random but mouth-watering assortment of upscale comfort food, from steak tartar, to turkey chili, to a grilled fontina cheese sandwich with bacon. We look up momentarily and see an incredibly suave gentleman being seated nearby. That would be Taye Diggs (We then concur that they have incredibly tasty appetizers).We won't let a review slip by without mentioning the drinks, of course, which were a bit of a mixed bag. Our server proudly informed us that their specialty cocktails are Cosmopolitans (We were not amused), Manhattans, Martinis, and...wait for it...RASPBERRY Cosmopolitans. We opted for wine, which came in a huge serving but wasn't quite cold enough, while Her Highness from from DUMBO decided to give the Manhattan a try (see pic for the adorable presentation, complete with a sidecar on ice). After a bit of explanation and substitution suggestions (as they were out of orange bitters), a Martinez arrived for one of Our loyal subjects.The evening's soundtrack consisted mostly of jazz standards and selections from the American songbook, but admittedly, We began tuning things out and imagining Taye crooning favorites from ""Rent,"" ""Chicago"" and ""Wicked."" Entrees arrived and were all pretty good, although Our grilled cheese with bacon came in portion more appropriate for a Princess, and Her Highness from DUMBO's meatballs needed a bit of extra seasoning (She likes it hot). Steak tartar was quite good.At this point, We excused Ourselves to the powder room and encountered another familiar face seated nearby, later identified as Frank Langella (""Frost / Nixon""), which was a bit more accurate than Our initial proclamation (""evil / political character across from the bar"").

1437,24,24,4.0,"Though my first visit was under duress, I couldn't deny the OM-NOM-NOM factor of the food. So when given the chance to drag Pete to brunch - I picked Clinton St. Baking Co. to unleash my inner (and outer) fat girl. The Good: Almost everything*. Between 2 (extremely gluttonous people) we shared the following; Fried green tomatoes w/ jalapeño sour cream -Look ma, I'm eating my veggies! So what if they're fried golden brown and slathered in a nummy, full fat, dairy dip? 2 Bloody Marys- His was with vodka, and mine was the gin version (I forgot what they called it) but both were good compliments to our egg dishes - nicely spiced, savory and well rounded. Coffee-He says it was typical; hot, fresh, and endless, so no complaints. Huevos Rancheros -Eggs, salsa, cheese, and though they kinda sorta skimped on the black beans, he cleaned his plate anyway. I'm thinking it might have had something to do with the ample amounts of guacamole and jalapeño sour cream they deposited on his tortilla, because mid-way through our meal, he rolled everything up like a massive blunt and pretty much inhaled it. Bacon -You can't just hack into the ass of any ole pig, fry it up and call it 'bacon' - there are (or at least should be) rules and regulations to proper pork procurement, and thank god CSBC gets it right. A side of bacon here entails 4 long and thick slices of pure hickory smoked oinky goodness, fried to the point of perfection where it's 25% crispy, 75% chewy, but not at all squishy with undercooked fat. Spanish Scramble -I love huge quantities of scrambled eggs. And cheese. And spicy chorizo. And onions and peppers. And when you swap out the sourdough toast for one of Clinton St. Baking Co.'s as-big-as-my-fist biscuits, you've got yourself hot sex on a platter. Hands down, the stars of the (brunch) show was this delish dish and the... Blueberry Pancakes -Fuck yeah! Fresh johnnycakes, crispy 'round the edges, riddled with blueberries and topped with a hot blueberry compote - these things made my morning (ok, by that time, it was noon.) The platonic ideal of blueberry pancakes, and *I* don't even like pancakes as an entree...yet somehow I found myself devouring 1/2 the stack. And the maple butter is soooooo good, we ended up dipping our bacon into it; we're gluttons like that. The Bad: As a party of 2, we arrived at 10:10AM on a Sunday and were seated by 11:15...and we were the lucky ones. But since the weather was nice and he brought some reading materials, we grabbed a seat on the neighboring door stoop to enjoy our time in the sunshine. Every so often, the hostess walked around the crowd (yes, crowd) with pancake bites and maple butter, partly to keep us satiated, but I also think she enjoyed being a tease. This joint is kinda small, and though the single bathroom is handicap friendly, as time goes on the waiting crowd is not. While basking in the glow of brunch in our window seat, several waiting tourists (I'm assuming), who had prolly only heard about this place from Bobby Flay's Showdown, would come right up to the window to point, stare and gesture towards our plates or us in general, as if deciding what to order or figuring out which table would be available next. Well, if this is a game of who can be the biggest asshole - please note that I WILL ALWAYS WIN; we purposely ate slow, dawdled, and had a lovely conversation, just to waste time/piss people off (luckily, our server never rushed us). And to the bitch who pretty much hovered over us as we ate, even when I politely asked you not to, I hope you enjoy the large bruise in your tramp stamp/lower back. (Personal space - and these pancakes- will make you throw them 'bows.)  Oh yeah...and with tax and tip, this was almost a Benjamin brunch (read - $100). Mind you, we fully admit to being a couple of piggy mcgreedypants who ultimately ordered 3 entrees, 2 sides, and 2 alcoholic drinks for 2 people, but we still balked a lil bit at the final bill...espesh considering that it's just eggs, pork, and pancakes. The Ugly:Wack Hash Browns* - This ain't nothing more than potatoes shoved through a ricer, then burned on both sides while left raw in the middle. I think my Southern sensibilities just shed a tear. Omelets* - On my first visit, I ordered one, thinking, since everything else was tasty, it would be the AWESOMEST OMLETTE EVAR! But instead, it was an EGG FAIL - imagine the blandest eggs (possibly powdered - where's the freshness?) cooked the blandest way possible (why are these eggs so perfectly sunshine yellow -where's the slight browning/crispiness 'round the edges?), then filled in the blandest way (the cheese, ham, and mushrooms were just sitting there awkwardly, like 6th graders at a school dance - where's the intermingling?) In conclusion - if you've got time to wait, inner/outer fat girls to unleash and cash to burn (no plastic), you'll fit in. 3.5 stars...rounded up to 4. Brunch is love.",27,0.9988

1439,27,19,4.0,"If food has a master, it is salt. I like salt. It has fascinated me from my school days. In chemistry, I loved seeing the flame colors of various metal salts (barium: apple green, and potassium: lilac were my favorites). In economics, I learnt that salt had once served as currency. In history I learned that Gandhi launched his non-violent movement for Indian Independence by making salt from the sea, thereby defying the British Salt Tax. Perhaps impressed by the fact that salt is the only rock we eat, dell'Anima is launching its own culinary movement, of accentuating salt. Sadly the movement has grown violent, as it occasionally engages in all-out war on the senses thus drowning out the flourishes and nuances of textural complexity and heat of the supporting cast.This has been a grudging acknowledgment for me. I loved dell'Anima the first time I visited (last August). I love the neighborhood (who doesn't). I loved the affordable wine options. The room was warm, the ambiance inviting, and the service extremely attentive. To top it all, they had the (then) best chicken dish I had tasted in a very long while: ""the chicken al diavolo"". The layer of skin complemented the juiciness of the boneless half-chicken, which had been rubbed generously with smoked Paprika. The accompanying braised escarole and currants just rounded out the flavors magnificently. It was lip-smacking good. Eating beautiful food in the midst of beautiful people (mind you, not the 'salt of the earth' types), you couldn't get better than this.Or, so I thought. As the popularity of dell'Anima soared, and one couldn't get a table at a decent dining hour for a month in advance, the service started to wilt and the salt excesses started becoming apparent. In a subsequent visit, the award winning bruschette (a do-it-yourself version with bread and 3-5 different spreads) no longer seemed as winning. While the chickpea with lime, the avocado, and the lily confit (shallot, onion, garlic) spreads thrilled - the ricotta with sea salt, and the tuna with fennel disappointed. Nevertheless, my vegetarian friend still found the Agnolotti with squash and sage in brown butter sauce as the best pasta dish she had ever had.It should be clear that dell'Anima's loyalties are towards salt, and not sugar. Even though they have two kinds of cake for dessert: the flourless chocolate cake, and the espresso almond cake, their heart isn't in it. I would still pick the espresso almond, to complete the meal.I don't know whether the owners were inspired by the fairy tale of Cap-o-Rushes (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca… ) when they decided to highlight the salt, but most people I know have a different relationship with salt. Don't get me wrong, Salt: I like you. Just not like that. (THAT would be sugar) ;)",26,0.9932

Damn ... you should tell us where to get dinner!""And then my career as a journalist finally comes in handy. I have to run down the checklist of where, when, who('s going), how much are you spending and why in God's green earth haven't you gotten that thing looked at?Inevitably they will answer all those questions incorrectly. When? 7pm on Saturday*Where? Times Square**Why? We just want to seeeee yoooouuuu****How much? We're willing to pay for a decent meal -- $10 or so.You see, when you have friends visiting from out of town, they're just not used to how much everything is, nor how much effort will be involved in getting there/getting a table. They can't handle the trip straight to the Lower East Side (which is why people eat at Appelbee's in New York -- sometimes familiarity is comforting).But sometimes I come to Yelp, and I ask it, oh great and wise green wizard***** for a suggestion, since, y'know, that's ostensibly what it's for, and it spits back the absolute perfect place for what I'm looking.Trattoria wasn't something you'd confuse for a straight-out-of-Arthur-Ave-Italian joint, but it certainly was all the things I needed it to be with picky eaters from out of town. The food was good, filling and not overly priced. The wine list was varied enough to give them the feeling that they were actually choosing something other than 'red' or 'white' (which is something they do in the big city).And it was close enough to their hotel in Times Square that I didn't make them walk too far, but far enough away that we weren't violated by the neon and gaudiness (which we got later, when I took them on a walking tour of Times Square).I'm definitely adding this to my list****** of Italian places near Times Square where I can take tourists.* - As if there aren't 20 million other people going to dinner at that time** - Despite it being the center of your favorite TV show, there's lots of places I've never been, or know well. I can't take you on the Sex and the City Tour, either.****** - I once had four female roommates at one time, so it's entirely possible I probably could take you on this tour.**** - If you really wanted to see me, you'd come with me to Hooters, 'cause that's where I like to go.***** - Has shot the food.****** - I really do keep a list.

1443,27,24,4.0,"I did a LOT of preparation before coming here. Seriously. I read all the Yelp reviews, talked to my peeps, and wrote a detailed ""what to do"" email to my friend. I also denied a third friend because I was worried about party size.After showing up (a Friday around 11AM) all the tables were full, so I sauntered over to the random shelf of canned foods to wait. A waiter came over (I think Shopsin's son?) and asked ""Are you waiting to eat? Stand over there."" Terrified I had messed up, I scurried over to the wall across from the cheese shop, head down, partially covering my face.I'd only check my phone when I was out of viewing distance from Shopsin (sitting in a comfy chair inside the restaurant) and I kept it in my purse at all times. Once my friend arrived, Shopsin's son seated us. He was actually quite pleasant. After I ordered the Nutella shake, he said ""One of your friends told you to order that, huh?"" Yes, my beloved friend, Yelp.So we shared the shake (absolutely freaking delicious. not too sweet, thick but not too thick to flow through the straw), Tasty 1 (butterscotch, mac & cheese, smore pancakes), and the Blisters in my Sisters with chorizo. We weren't totally enamored with the mac & cheese pancakes. I mean they were quite good (yes, with the maple + hot sauce), but I wouldn't be able to eat more than one. The smore and butterscotch, whew, now those were tasty TASTY. Next time I want to try the slutty pancakes for sure! The pancake batter is perfectly fluffy and light. AND you get real maple syrup! But in all honesty the pancakes were so flavorful they didn't even need the excess calories. The Blisters in my Sisters was good. A hearty egg dish with lots of oomph. Not so incredible that I'd need to order this again, though.Granted we were here on a weekday and it was not crowded, but service was pretty solid. We never felt rushed. I was almost disappointed in the lack of drama until we saw a random woman sit in Shopsin's seat, thinking it was a seat for people to sit in while waiting. Ooohhhh. Shopsin's daughter unsuccessfully tried to evict her. Shopsin returned, asked the lady to leave, and after she refused, tried to physically dump her out of the chair. Finally, she left after he took her grocery cart and pushed it away, all while mocking her. Wow. Brunch and a show!I think this could be a five (provided I don't get yelled at), but I first need to find a savory dish that lives up to the pancakes!So here's what led to my success:1. Don't come with more than two people. There are three tables of two, and room for three at the counter.2. Study, study, STUDY the menu online beforehand. Be ready to order within a few minutes.3. Don't ask for recommendations or substitutions.4. Don't be a vegan. Vegetarian is okay.5. Don't use your phone when Shopsin can see you while you're waiting. Don't keep your phone out while seated.6. Don't order too much food. If you do, the chef will come out and tell you ""That's way too much fucking food. I'm not cooking it all unless you eat it all.""7. Don't come on a Saturday, unless you want to wait forever. Don't come on a Sunday because they're not open.8. Don't come if you're on a diet.9. CASH ONLY. I can't even imagine what Shopsin would do if you threw down an AmEx Platinum on the check.10. Don't ask if they do take-out or delivery. They don't.",42,0.9761

I am happy (and surprised) to guacamole was fantastic, and I am a HARSH critic when it comes to this green serving of heaven. The salsa? Not so much. It didn't taste like anything special. The enchiladas, on the other hand, were special. The salsa verde was tangy and spicy, the cheese was melty and scrumptious...and it was in my stomach all too quickly! We were both pretty impressed, but felt like we were missing out when we saw everyone surrounding us had ordered the Enchiladas with mole sauce.

1450,16,14,4.0,"It's probably appropriate that my hundredth review is for an evening of dinner and drinks that was so great, I don't totally remember the end of the night. Especially at a restaurant that prides itself on its bourbon and whiskey selection, I think that's a sign of a happy customer.Before you even walk in the door, it smells like bacon. This is a wonderful thing.There's a small bar in front and a small dining area in back. It's not huge, so reservations are definitely recommended. The largest tables can fit six people tightly, I think. We were a group of 8 and they added a small table to our banquette to accomodate us. Initially my res was for a group of 12, which they said they could accomodate, but I'm not totally sure how they would have done it. It may have required two separate tables.There is a big long list of whiskeys, since that's their specialty. There's a small handful of whiskey-focused signature cocktails, too. My drink of choice was the Whiskey and Rye -- a play on the song, but it's a pint of Six Points Rye beer and an ounce of whiskey. Hello, trouble! Yes, I'll have another. (If whiskey isn't your thing, they also have a full bar.)For food, we shared the cheese curds with a pimento dipping sauce -- very tasty and good food for sharing. We also got the house cured bacon. They're thick cuts of bacon, super tasty, and served with a salad with yummy black eyed peas. I got the scallops served with a very rich butternut squash puree and decorated with bits of ham. (If you don't do pork, don't do Char No. 4 -- it's in everything. For me, though, that's a good thing.) The shrimp and grits were also well-liked at the table and the beef link was outstanding. I may get that next time. There also was a special of a pork chop which was truly the best pork chop I've ever had before... too bad it's not a staple on the menu!!!All in all, it was a great meal and I look forward to coming back.

The many yelp references to (Dessert) King notwithstanding, I see myself more as the humble bee that identified the one flower with honey inside enabling King Solomon to escape the predicament of looking foolish.The place is the same. The customers haven't changed. The croissants and pastries also look the same. Heck, even the coffee tastes as bad as it always did! But this hardworking bee can identify that what one is eating is a product of Patisserie Pablo, even if the name outside the West Village bakery still says Patisserie Claude. Sadly, Claude has left the building - after handing over the reins to his able, longstanding sidekick, Pablo.I've been a 'regular' at Claude for years (~2 times a week). I may not have been so for a quarter of a century, as were a few patrons, but a regular nonetheless. Now the benefits of this designation may not have extended to price discounts, but what they earned me was something I cherished. Claude knew I loved his Pain Au Chocolat, and every time I showed up to greet him, he would go to the back of his bakery and find me a warm one - as opposed to those in the display case. Trust me - there was absolutely NO comparison between the two croissants. That was Claude's reward for my loyalty of patronage. Later, when he realized that I loved the Espresso Mousse Napoleon, he would always let me know that he had some at the back, even if it meant cutting up a whole cake for a few pieces.I can not be definitive about what made Claude like me. It could well have been my habit of having exact change, for Claude was always short of it. Or, it could have been my manners and politeness. Now I know no French but always greeted him with Bonjour and bid him Au Revoir. That alone was enough for him to greet me with a smile. His legendary temper and grumpiness aside, he respected courteous people and loathed those with airs about them. He sized me up pretty soon and by my second visit, had started to make small talk. Now, it takes me time to open up to anyone, but Claude could tell I respected his genius. He beamed when he learned that I visited him from the Upper East Side. ""Ah, but you don't go to Monsieur Payard?"" I told him that Payard was the only other place in the city, where I could consider myself a regular. He appreciated the genuineness of the compliment, and from that day would always let me know if there was something new in his shop. Slowly, I got to sample every single one of his creations - from Palmiers to macarons, from quiche to brioche, and all the tarts and pastries that he made.But, Claude could also be cruel. There was a stretch of time when I didn't visit him for months. When I went back, he did not greet me with a smile. He still remembered, though, that I loved the chocolate croissant. Without my telling him what I wanted, he muttered ""Pain Au chocolat?"" and took out one from the display case! Ouch, I thought, I have let down Claude. To reinforce that I was now in the dog house, he smiled at the regular behind me and went to the back of the bakery to get him a warm croissant!! Slowly, and gradually, I won him back. I would visit frequently, and at different times (he was more relaxed in the afternoons and evenings) and buy more stuff. One evening, when I inquired about his annual summer vacation in France, he dropped the bombshell that he would not take one this year for he intended to retire by the end of the year. I was shocked. He told me that he intended to retire to South America, now that his daughter would soon be done with her studies. ""Tired of the heat in the kitchen. The long hours..."" he continued mumbling words that I could no longer register. It seemed as if my world were swirling around me..... And then one day, he was gone. I have no idea why it impacted me that much! Given my love for all things sweet, I could easily find solace with other competent options in the city. But, it was as if I had opened my heart for the first time, to commit, and now there were only memories. Given the emptiness inside, I knew that I could no longer review desserts - and, switched over to a new passion altogether: pizza.Time heals all wounds, and I have picked myself up, and started reviewing desserts again. I even had the courage to visit Patisserie Claude this morning and greet Pablo who remembered my usual: Pain Au Chocolat. I also bought a pound of cookies while promising to be back.

A LOT of food for the one person who ordered it. I had the rotisserie chicken (very good and came with a spicy sauce), fried yuca (very good, moist, cooked through but not dry) and an avocado salad which was surprisingly really good, there was a mix of iceberg and green leaf lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, red onions and another vegetable but I'm not sure what it was, since at this point in the evening I was under the influence and things started to get blurry.

NOW.Billdozer, Andy, and myself had a lovely vacation day all planned out starting first with Coney Island :http://www.yelp.com/biz/beer-island-brooklyn#hrid:xwaKvJfL7dBISNIhScWloA to be followed immediately by the famed Log Cabin bar.Inside the Log Cabin there is nary a log nor anything remotely cabin-esque about it. There ARE:1. Five taps of beer only serving Budweiser. $2 per pint. Yes, you read right. Upon further musing of our trips down there, I cannot conjure up in my mind anyone drinking any other type of beer besides the Bud draft they have. Sam Adams? No. Coors Light? No. Heineken? No. Some micro-brewed, from Washington State pilsner made with organic hops? They'll kick you in your face.2. Food in the back. I don't know why. But they have a type of buffet situation, at least on the weekends. Andy had ""very, VERY good chicken salad"" (read: tuna salad. he'd never had it before. ""I don't fuck with tuna"", he says. Yes you do. You just did and loved it.)I had some chili that was good and some delicious pasta thing.3. Karaoke every single night. The guys that come in looking like they're straight out of the Sopranos can sing Frank Sinatra dead-on. I saw the best karaoke performance of my life there. 4. Scary dudes. A lot of them are there to sing, but some of them...are not. If provoked, I think they would beat the crap out of me. Maybe it was the mushrooms that made me think that. Wait, what? Nevermind.5. Wonderful bartenders named Athena that comp several rounds of drinks.6. Mysteriously hot karaoke leaders named Lisa.7. A sign that says, ""What happens in the Log Cabin stays in the Log Cabin"".8.

Surprisingly the experience was fantastic and completely fulfilled a late night craving for warm, delicious food.The decor is is not one to balk at but it certainly surpasses the dingy standard in the area. It looks clean (even the bathrooms) and almost cabin like with its woody interior. After a gander in their menu, it was clear most people were here for their super cheap prices and extensive selection of Vietnamese fare.Our waitress knew no Vietnamese and was not ashamed to admit it. She claimed that while the owner is Vietnamese, none of the staff was Viet or even Yue Hua Qiao (Chinese Viet). They did have a lot of recommendations for us and was friendly throughout the course of the meal.I had a little bit of everything, from samples of their delicious Banh Hoi and Bo Kho to my own generous bowl of Pho Tai. Without a doubt, the food was mighty tasty. My broth in my Pho was strong (perhaps a little too much star anise?) but packed a lot of flavor punch with every sip. My thin strips of flank beef, were perfectly chewy without any hint of toughness. The Cha Gio were abundant with just the right amount of crisp and tasted even better with a dip into the fish sauce.Gia Lam is also open late as well, closing at midnight on weeknights and till 2AM on the weekends.

The oh-too-brief moments you're in my mouth are the few times in my everyday life I can experience true happiness.Enter Fette Sau - German for 'Fat Pig', this seemed like the perfect place to refuel between stops on the Brooklyn Brews Bar Crawl. The space is basically 3 long picnic tables in an open garage and decorated like a sparse warehouse cafeteria (think chalk boards, meat hooks, bare lightbulbs) complete with a bar serving up their own brewed beer. Because we arrived right when they opened, seating wasn't an issue, but at this first come, first seated joint, you might wanna do what we did if you're a large party by bogarting an entire table to yourselves before the crowds come. (I never entered the 2 bathrooms, so I can't comment on their wheelchair friendliness, but the tables are low enough to not be an issue.)If memory serves me correctly, for two people I ordered;-Two beers: whatever the 'home brand' was what we drank. And it was tasty enough, however the following foods stole the show.-Broccoli Salad: this was vinegar tangy and pretty tasty, but it was purposely cold! From a healthy colon perspective, Mama approves - but this woulda been 10X better warmed up.-BBQ baked beans: I want to be slathered in this, head to toe, for no reason other than my perverse enjoyment. Imagine the best baked beans you ever had in your life. Now add chopped up bits of smoked pork. Then multiply that by a million. Now do you understand why I want to bathe in these beans?-1/3 pound of Pork Ribs: Dry rubbed = heaven. A good rack of ribs never needs sauce, however I used these suckers like little mops to transport the 3 types of bottled sauces on the table into my mouf. Fall off the bone yummy, with lovely smoke rings as an indicator of a quality product. Mama approves.- 1/3 pound of Brisket - Moist, tender and flavorful, with a good char on the outside. I stuffed a couple of slices into the complimentary rolls, doused it all in sauce, and shoveled those sam'iches into my face with the quickness.-and of course...SAUSAGE.

This was the feeling I had, in an instant, when I bit into Buttermilk Channel's Bacon in a mustard sauce. For $5 you were served two pieces of thick-cut, high-quality bacon in a slightly smoky, sweet mustard sauce that brought hosannas from on high as your mouth rejoiced in it. This bacon could stop wars. It could start religions.Okay, enough about the bacon. (But it was very, very good.) The place is pretty loud, so if possible, sit outside (or just talk even louder than the crowd). I'm not into very loud dinners so I don't think I'd be happy eating indoors.I had a fantastic time at Buttermilk channel for a number of reasons. My Fair Harbor cocktail was essentially a well-made Dark and Stormy. Delicious, albeit somewhat pricey ($11). Oysters on the half shell are one of my many weaknesses, and my neighborhood suffers from a lack of places that serve them. So I was delighted to order 8 of the succulent bivalves with the accoutrements of a housemade cocktail sauce and a blood-orange mignonette. At $2.25 a piece they weren't a steal but they were very good oysters and that price is maybe on the low end of standard for NYC.At the recommendation of a friend from an earlier BBQ in Fort Greene I ordered the Duck Meatloaf, not knowing what to expect. What emerged looked like a large burger patty with an onion ring on top, in a gorgeous vibrant green puree of salsify. The dish was rich, almost overpoweringly so, but flavors that made my eyes roll back into my head at least once.Service was excellent. Tight, professional, never cloying.We got there at 7 on a Saturday and were seated almost immediately; by 8 o clock they were quoting over an hour wait.The only complaint, besides the noise was that the apple popovers (replacing what most restaurants would serve as bread) were slightly burnt and not good.I will go back, definitely. They have a very good thing going, but know this--eating here will break any and all diets. And that is something to embrace!",15,0.9945
1466,11,5,4.0,"Chinantla is a little gem within a mostly barren strip of Myrtle ave. It's a strange combo of a Mexican grocery in the front - selling things like Mexican sodas, caned goods, and fresh mexican-ish produce like cactus and tomatillos - and a delightfully informal restaurant in the back. It's equipped with many tables sparsely occupied by tired looking laborers drinking coronas, charming and entertaining photos of old mexico on the walls, and TVs playing futbol and nothing but futbol. It is a mexican establishment for mexicans. But gringos don't fret! The staff is friendly and warm, and the atmosphere, though plain, is thoroughly relaxing. My friends have been talking up Castro's (that's just up the street) as the best Mexican around. But I've been and I felt that it was a little lackluster, and left not feeling completely satisfied with the experience. So I later decided to step into Chinantla in search of something that would finally scratch the itch for authentic mexican-new yorker food, and found that the food itself was better by leaps and bounds. I'm talking yummy.The menu is ginormous, the ingredients are fresh, and everything is made to order. I usually get the sopes for $2.50 that are pressed and cooked fresh from dough when you order and covered with meat (if you like that sort of thing), beans, delicious Mexican cheese, cream(like sour cream but the real liquid non-dolloping kind), lettuce, and tomato. And I recently just tried the vegetarian burrito and decided that it was the best vegetarian burrito that I've ever had. Ever! Though I haven't had that many, because they're usually full of broccoli and crap, and aren't usually good. Their hot sauce and salsa hit the mark like a spicy bullseye, their cheese is the kind you want to eat in fistfuls, rice and beans are killer, plus you never have to wait in line at this place (it's like my secret mexican food place). And did I mention they have quart bottles of Sol and Carta Blanca? Um, yeah, big chubby cold bottles of Sol just to make sure you're totally satisfied.The food is cheaper than Castro's but it's still not cheap as dirt, as I usually prefer.

1467,13,21,4.0,"Last week I could sense that I was coming to the end of my proverbial rope, dangling by a single thread. I had this epiphany that my life, as a 24 year old working in the greatest city in the world, was leaning toward worhtless and I was less than enthusiastic about calling Bay Ridge my home. Then I started pondering if that gerbil on the wheel realizes that he's running in place. Am I that gerbil? Finally the noise in my mind had crescendoed to a dull roar, a cacaphony. The phone rings at 2:30 PM as I'm scouring the internet. I'm guestimating the number of tourists I will bump into trying to leave Grand Central and get on the 6 train to go home, because I'm a pinball when I'm walking through GC and have absolutely no patience. ""Chris J., this is Mom J. we're going out to dinner tonight. Meet us at Caneda's."" Shocked, I replied,""Mom J., are you sure? Are the roommates up to it?"" Annoyed, because she hates to repeat herself, ""Yes, of course. Nothing changes. You never listen to me. Your roommate is the one who suggested it.""Fast forward to 6:30 PM; by this time I've gone through my normal choreography in GC with the tourist folk. I've transfered twice and magically appear at Caneda's to see my family already perched at their table. I walk through the doors, unplug myself from my own little world (iPod) and deal with reality, my family, and my roommates. Ordering for us is always an ordeal. Indecision causes paralysis. Fancy Italian names don't jive well with Lebanese and Irish decendents. My favorite is my mom yelling out Polo (like the Ralph Lauren brand), butchering ""pollo."" Part of me just wants to yell, ""Mom STFU this isn't Marco Polo (that great childrens' game),"" or maybe lament, ""I'm sorry Polo is not on the menu tonight."" We order, salads, shrimp cocktail, and order veal, chicken, and pasta dishes for entrees. By this time, my roommates have reached their quota of a drink. My Mom (Mom J.) smiles as per usual, uneasy because she's typically a gregarious woman, but doesn't know what to talk about with my roommates since the accident. She sips her wine, casually, demonstrating her understanding of social grace and proper eating etiquette. At this point I take a breath, I drink in my tap water, and the environs. Then it hits me. This setting is surreal, from the pastel colored wallpaper, to the mirrored walls - we're reinacting a scene from Scarface. The same decor that characterized the wealthy Miami cocaine moguls of the 70s and Scarface has been impeccably transplanted into this Itallian Restaurant in Bay Ridge. Aside from the decor (blunder in my opinion, but charming nonetheless), the food is quite good. The service was a bit lacking, and we had a long wait between our appetizers and main course, but the quality of food was exceptional. I had a Caesar salad for appetizer, and seafood ravioli's as an entree and both were better than good, but shy of great. The Ceasar salad was fresh, with crispy romaine lettuce, but not enough dressing and it tasted like the salty element was missing (anchovies, and lack of parmesean cheese). The seafood ravioli were the highlight for me. They were moderately priced at $13.99, and were accompanied by a pink sauce with fresh lobster and crab meat. Overall my meal was very good. I desperately hope my roommates order dessert, to delay the inevitable, reality. No such luck, but Caneda's was perfect for a two hour rest from my thoughts.This would be a good place to take a girl on a date, and leave with enough money to take her out for drinks after.

There is a sign right outside of it telling you that downstairs is a printing store (clever trick or over labored effort?). Although there is a graffiti of the store's name on the pavement, had you not known of store Nom De Guerre beforehand, you would have just assumed that the graffiti was one more work of street art in SoHo.Going down the stairs, A. and I were first met with .... (surprise!) a basement complete with cinder blocks, flickering lights, puddle of dirty water, and graffiti. But A., having been here before, knew that the store was behind the unmarked door.Inside was a tiny and sparsely decorated space. As we enter, I immediately realize that there's no air conditioning inside-- just a large industrial fan whirling away. There are two floors, with the lower one being the one with marked-down items. There's only one person on staff, and he looks up at us as we enter, greet us, and allows us to browse without being bothered. Well, it's really only A. who is doing the browsing.Of the two of us, A. is the only one who could shop here because Nom De Guerre is a men's clothing shop with goods way above my price range.I look through the stuff, mostly out of curiosity, and I turn around to tell A. that I actually really like the clothes here. After all, a speakeasy isn't a speakeasy based on its in-the-know attitude alone-- a crappy secret is... a crappy secret. But Nom De Gurre is more remarkable for the quality of its goods, rather than any attempts at secrecy.The clothes here simple and smart. From the limited color palette (white, black, gray, and sometimes blue or brown) to the sparse designs, the clothes at Nom De Guerre attest to the aesthetics of simplicity. Because I've always had disdain for visually loud and overly trendy designs, I was impressed how the clothing here was both simple, clean, and yet undeniably trendy.

1471,17,18,4.0,"As a Filipino, my appreciation of pork was cultivated at a very early age. I can - and will - eat pork a million different ways, from pork blood stew (diniguan) to deep fried knuckles (crispy pata) to whole roasted suckling pig (lechon). I've probably eaten everything but the snout (those ears sure do get nice and crispy!). So whenever an opportunity arises to try pork in a new way, you know this little piggy ain't staying home.My Yelper-in-crime sent me a link with a picture of the Porchetta sandwich and my salivary glands went into overdrive immediately. We made our way down there on a Friday night, around 9:30. I was anticipating a long line out the door b/c of the reviews and blogs, but we lucked out and had no wait at all. We even snagged a few stools along their tiny counter and made friendly with Matt, the chef/owner's cousin and resident cashier. There were three of us, so Matt recommended that we each get a sandwich and then share the potatoes and greens (broccoli rabe). The sandwich was everything I hoped it would be - salty, crunchy, juicy...I'll go so far as to say it was absolutely porkalicious. The rosemary added a nice flavor, although I do agree that it could have used a little bit of something else to cut the saltiness. The greens did a decent job of that, but maybe I should have just stuck them in my sandwich. The potatoes, as everyone else has noted, were delicious. Gotta love crispy bits of pork mixed in with taters!It's not my habit to eat sandwiches for dinner, so I was a little worried that it wouldn't fill me up. But they really stuff the ciabatta with plenty of pork, so I was quite full by the end. My friends only ate half their sandwiches in order to save room for dessert - I'm rarely that forward-thinking, unfortunately.My friend asked Matt how many sandwiches one of those bad boys serves up, and he said about 25.

Stepping into Raines Law Room is walking into a narrative that's been constructed for you. It's not just a space - it's got a plot to it. And a set designer, a gaffer, and a customer interaction designer. All top-notch, I might add.Step into the unassuming apartment building and ring the bell. You'll be invited in personally and welcomed, and you'll be in a restricted space, where a vintage phonograph, some tin types recessed in the wall, and some other terrific relics pepper the scene. You get the sense that you should straighten up and brush up your manners in case Virginia Woolf is on the other side of the curtain. In front of you is the ""guest book,"" which lists the cocktails in hand-styled calligraphy. Fabulous.Beyond the curtains the bar stretches in front of you - a narrow, dim corridor with pools of light accenting all of the interior design highlights. Gorgeous, soft chairs in muted colors. Old, framed mirrors lining the walls. Further down, booths of black velvet with personal curtains you can draw to isolate your party. And finally, a quaint country kitchen where the cocktails are made, the dangerously infectious popcorn is popped, and the food is prepared. It all comes together and you're in a totally different world.But the magic is in the details. Read the menu and realize that this bar was named after a law that inadvertently catalyzed the proliferation of prostitution in saloon 'hotels'. See that motif played out on the seemingly harmless fleur-de-lis wallpaper - which in fact is comprised of images of tiny and varying acts of sexual play. Pull the chain to summon the waitress, and observe that it lights up a light with your table's number in the kitchen. Actually asking patrons to alter how they deal with the waitstaff is risky, and there is the problem that when you've had a few - you forget that you have the chain, and you wonder why the waitress hasn't been by. But ultimately I think it works.Note that each glass that holds a drink is different from every other glass, that is, if you go the cocktail route. Listen to the delightful playlist that ranges from obscure jazz to Beirut to Rufus Wainwright. The lighting by the mirrors in the booths is no less than Rembrandt-esque. You can get some surprisingly fun photographs. As for the drinks themselves - they were nice. All classic cocktails, though they will mix with vodka and they won't look at you funny. Not the best I've had, but certainly nice. The selection wasn't the most impressive and they said they had no plans to modify the list. I had a Rumble (which is a Bramble with rum instead), and it was decent. The Champs Elysees was less impressive, but it certainly wasn't a disappointment. I cannot WAIT to go back, not so much for the finest cocktails on earth; I'll always go to Milk & Honey for that, but - just for the opportunity to step into another time and place, and to sit on that black velvet again.

Fifteen minutes on the 58 bus and we ended up in Flushing. We are off for a good Korean Cuisine!!As usual we relied on the Yelp reviews for a good meal on this very cold weather. We went to Bitgoul ........One of the specialties is SOON DOO BOO...a bubbling tofu casserole served in a stone pot. It can be ordered with different degrees of spiciness. I had the Spicy-spicy. Hmmmmm.... You can select from an assortment of ingredients...Beef, pork, shrimps, clams,octopus,mushrooms.  I had the Seafood combination!!! Boy!!! was it really hot!!! One of the best casseroles I've ever had in this snowy cold winter day. I am not really a tofu fan but this one is excellent.  We were also given several small plates of free Korean appetizers which include different kinds of Kimchi and an egg. The egg you are suppose to crack in the still bubbling SOON DOO BOO. Camille had Bibimmbap...a popular Korean dish which literally means bowl of mixed white rice seasoned with vegetables and meat...Her dish came in a deep cast iron skillet which had a hot crispy crust on the bottom...served with Gochejang or spicy sauce. Another excellent choice. We both shared the dishes...they had originally provided us with small bowls...I guess for this purpose.(share)The prices...a little pricey ...in Flushing standards....The Soon Doo Boo was $10.00 and the Bibimbap was $15.00. The cheapest in the menu...The other specialties which is Bolgogi and Jap Chae were $20.00 plus......

Mmm.Momofuku Milk is pretty effing good. The place is laid out for fairly quick service - something they delivered on even on a Saturday night at 10. The crowd is always nice there because everyone there knows they're all in it to win it and get their fat girl on. The employees were swift and friendly and extremely helpful. The only ish is that when they run out of stuff it's a done deal - so getting there at 10 on a Saturday night pretty much guaranteed a limited selection. My bad. We ordered a slice of the carrot cake, the crack pie and 2 marshmallow-cornflake-choc chip cookies. The carrot cake was 5 layers of heaven - fluffy spiced cake, dense cream cheese frosting and a cinnamon-y layer of creamy goodness. Quite similar to the last orgy I was involved in (kidding...?) the 5 layers hit the spot and made for a great carrot cake. The cake texture impressed me the most as some carrot cakes can take on a mushier texture or have too much carrot - but this cake was firm and just the right amount rabbit food.The crack pie was good but in comparison to our other stuff it was a little plain - it tasted like a congealed blondie without any toppings. I felt like it would have benefitted from some nuts or white chocolate chips - SOMETHING to give it character. Crack pie has major stephanie tanner middle child syndrome - it's really needing to do something to stand out . Coincidentally Jodie Sweetin took up a meth habit so maybe the crack pie can take a cue. All in all good but not noteworthy.On to the cookies. David Chang just owned Mrs. Fields and Betty Crocker and all of these other cookie-sellin bitches. OWNED. The cornflake-marshmallow-chocolate chip cookie is unreal. The buttery cookie and crispier edges and a soft dense center. The flavors melded together so well that my taste buds were harmonizing like they were singing in church. I could have easily eaten a dozen of them. I was eager to try other cookies but these were the only ones left at the this time - boo. I will return to try to corn cookie which I am told is phenomenal.Our server graciously let us sample the graham cracker and the root beer float soft serve. Both were spot on in taste and the root beer float soft serve tasted almost a little fizzy. I particularly loved the graham cracker soft serve and think it would probably taste great with some berries thrown on top. The root beer float flavor was excellent but a little runnier than the former flavor.Unfortunately I will be back. A lot. Let's just pray my inner fat girl doesn't turn into an outer one.",17,0.9968

He arrived, tried them on, and then sprawled out on my living room couch as he made visual love to cable TV (an important luxury missing in his life). Chris J.: I'm getting hungry. I could eat a humongous pastrami on rye from Katz's. Brother: You want pastrami? That sounds good. I could definitely do pastrami, but it's too cold to walk around this city. There's a place up here I want to try. Pastrami something... Chris J.: Look it up on Yelp, rookie. Brother: I'm looking on menupages, but nothing is in your neighborhood. Chris J.: Act like you've lived in the city for more than a day, moron. I told you go to Yelp. Brother: Here it is. Pastrami Queen. Chris J: You're the only queen, I know. I had planned to get my Christmas shopping done with my brother, instead we feasted on pastrami. I consider Katz's the Holy Grail of Jewish Delicatessens, so keep that in mind. The Pastrami Queen is very good and quite an acceptable UES alternative. The sandwich itself costs $12.50 and I think there's a generous 3/4 pound of flesh in between the rye. However, the meat isn't quite as lean and thickly hand-carved as Katz's offerings, and the sandwich not nearly as fully stuffed. You go to Katz's for the experience and the great food (see my Katz's review). You come to Pastrami Queen for very good food. There's really no catchy ""I'll have what she's having"" moment here. If I'm ever craving thick and fatty meat in the UES (requisite childish humor), I'll consider Pastrami Queen.",19,0.9627

I mean, ducks are such beautiful creatures; woosy, their pace amusingly drunken, their flight brief but graceful, their colors screaming grace and tranquility, their curved beaks emerging from the pond of evolution like a smirk of nature, and their quacks announcing all that is soft, tender and naive. But I ate my peking duck with remorseless abandon.Amazing 66? Amazing 666, The number of the beast.The invitation to sin is clear from the moment you enter; as opposed to other Chinatown eateries, Amazing is cleaner and glittery; big tables for large contingents of gluttons, and an overall sense of new that will make you feel comfortable as you sit down and start browsing the menu. I'll bypass the dumplings we ordered for apps (though they were okay) and go straight to the duck feast and how it was exactly that we went about enjoying our meal like the ravenous dog from Duck Hunt. You order a peking duck for two and they bring you two huge ducks smoldering with their golden and crusty skins, alongside a side of many soft wheat pancake-like breads. Then they bring sweet noodle sauce and hoisin sauce and you can start. First you pour your sweet noodle sauce into your bread, and then dismember the duck and place your pieces on the bread. Voila! You eat them like you would a soft tortilla taco, and once you begin, you will find yourself unable to stop, eating the whole duck in its entirety while sinking your teeth on the crunchy skin, and tasting the mixture of the soft wheat, the sweet sauce and the chewy, delicious duck meat. Oh, I ate, ate and ate, while I noticed that the chef was standing at the back of the room, staring straight back at me and smiling. It was as if he knew how much I loved ducks, and how much it was my pleasure to devour them in spite of my love. ""Beauty is not only skin deep"" -he seemed to be saying to me in Chinese. I nodded with fear and trembling.As it turns out, there wasn't anything diabolical about Amazing 66's almost apocalyptic name; a peking duck is bred for 65 days before being killed for this platter, so the 66th day is the day when you eat it. However, since the peking duck, which dates from the times of the Yuan and Ming dinasties, has been credited with the rapprochement of the United States and The People's Republic of China in the 1970's , as well as reportedly being preferred by many a dictator, I had no problem brushing aside my guilt and assigning a devilish omen to the Amazingness to be found at 66.

At the moment the Flea Market is located indoors in DUMBO, split between two buildings. It was a beautiful day and truly a pity that it wasn't outside in Fort Greene like during the warmer months. Upon walking into one of the buildings I was hit with dance music and baked goods. There was a table covered with muffins and other goodies to my right. I scanned the table looking for the lemon and chocolate studded cannolis I had read about but I was out of luck. Maybe I didn't look hard enough. Past the baked goods was another stall I had heard about, McClures Pickles. Oh mah gawd.I don't want to sound full of myself but many a man has peddled his pickles on me. This guy was pushing like crazy. A wonderful salesman! I am a pickle fanatic and everything I tasted was great. My favorite was the Garlic Dill pickle, which they also have in relish form. The relish is far more garlicky when broken down and makes for an interesting topping. The relish jar was $5.00, and the pickle jar was $10.00. A big sell was the fact that you can pickle your own vegetables after you finish the original product! All you have to do is put your veggies in the jar for a week and POOF. Tasty pickled goodness. I didn't actually buy a jar but I think I am going back this coming weekend. I mean, it's hard to justify spending $10.00 on a jar of pickles. The non-food related stalls were amazing as well. There was an unbelievable selection of vintage clothing, but I regret to report that it comes at a high price. I really don't feel like spending $80.00 on something that the vendor probably found at a Salvation Army or Beacon's Closet. Everything was top of the line but I'm a cheap mofo and couldn't shell out the dough. There were a number of vendors selling interesting antiquities, pages from science books from the 1800's, random ancient hardware and furniture. I found an incredible Audubon print but didn't even bother looking at the price. This review is turning into a lesson on how not to shop, or how to be a penny pincher.

Tucked away down from the tennis stadium on 96th Avenue, I found The Wine Room of Forest Hills. A nicely designed wine boutique owned and operated by Carolina Grunner.When I arrived they were having a tasting. I tasted all three selections, and nothing really struck me, so I looked around. They have a good selection of over 400 wines leaning heavily toward Italy. The staff are very friendly and seem knowledgeable. I spoke mostly to Gary Grunner, Carolina's husband.The prices seemed a little high for some things and low for others. They had the Produttori del Barbaresco that I had tasted in the video the day before for $20, when in The City it's $19. They also had the Masi Campofiorin Ripasso for $15 when in The City I paid $17.50. Not a big difference, but it made me wonder how a small shop out in Queens goes about buying their wine. I imagine that they have to buy a lot less of things than the bigger shops.At the end of the day Forest Hills is lucky to have a shop like this, with friendly folks that care about wine.

1501,18,8,4.0,"I've been coming here for years. For me this location of Amy's Bread is pretty much almost as good as it gets, it's nearly 5 stars, but I'm rounding down to 4 because the one down-side I do find about this place weighs rather heavily with me, namely, the line can get out of control, there's nowhere to wait, the door swings back and forth sometimes hitting people, sometimes the clientele can become rather rude to one another and to the employees, and then the otherwise very helpful waitstaff can become visibly frustrated and overwhelmed -- it's an unnecessary and unfortunate situation that could easily be remedied if some effort were put into it.The items I love most are: whole wheat bread with oats and pecans and golden raisins, black olive twists, red velvet cake, german chocolate cake, semolina bread with golden raisins and fennel, potato bread with onion and dill, almond brioche toast, sticky buns, cherry cream scones, pumpernickel bread with currants, and the kitchen sink cookies... Also, they sell Virgil's Root Beer and Reed's Ginger Brew, both of which are terrific and hard to find... I haven't had any of the sandwiches or pizzas or quiches or cupcakes, but I'll definitely try them at some point.When this place isn't crowded, which is rare, it can be a very relaxing and comfortable, and a few times I've actually got adventurous -- I'm not a coffee person (I just can't take caffeine), but a few times when it's cold outside and I really need a pick me up I've ordered the Parisian breakfast with cafe au lait -- there's just something almost magical about dipping a wonderfully crunchy baguette smeared with butter and Bonne Maman jam into a the huge cup of brew covered with delicious milk foam.",19,0.9904

I found this place accidentally while driving away empty handed from the 'Choke at 1AM (they were closing early on a weeknight, they sold out of everything). But when I saw the crowd of patrons lined up, I had to park and see what the commotion was about.From steak, chicken, pork, ""goat beef"", tripe, and even a scrumptuous veggie taco -- they are all cheap at $2.00 a piece - see my pic for the complete menu yelp.com/biz_photos/2qFV…)Note: They DO NOT have shrimp or fish tacos *bummer*Almost all the patrons were speaking Spanish to the cooks, so I remembered my traveler Spanish and ordered, ""Una carnitas y Dos Veggie tacos, por favor."" His response, ""You want a pork taco and two veggie tacos, yes? What to drink?"" I also got a bottle of grapefruit Jarritos, paid him $8 and patiently waited.Soon, many people were crowding around the taco truck and placing orders. So much Spanish was being spoken I couldn't make out everything that was said. But when my order came out I took it to the car and shared it with my partner-in-crime.My first impression when I opened the styrofoam container was the generous size of each taco -- these aren't ""two bite taquitos""! They come double wrapped in a soft-corn & flour tortilla (packaged, not homemade on premises). But more outstanding is how they fill these tacos with a generous heap of ingredients in the veggie taco: shredded lettuce, mexican rice, queso fresco (Mexican cheese), sliced tomato and avocado. The construction of the soft taco shell is also commendable: the tacos did not fall apart upon biting into it. The carnitas taco was also delicious -- the pork was flavorful and charred, and the crunchiness of the lettuce and the mildness of the queso fresco made this taco a tasty treat to savour.Overall, pretty good food (I agree with Rocky P., if it's frequented heavily Mexican clientele, that's got to be a good tip off), incredible value.

Yes, we know it's fun to Peep at the namesake establishment, or try to do your business sans TP -- or any measures of sanitation for that matter -- at Welcome to the Johnson's. And yes, you might get *a show* over at Apotheke's stalls, or be intrigued by Ally McBeal-esque co-ed set-ups at other hotspots. But only in Raines Law Room's left bathroom will you spy yourself from EVERY angle while you tinkle, simultaneously studying amorous men in action all around. (Anyone remember this? ""Oooh, what interesting china. It looks like young men playing leap frog!"" - ""The Birdcage""). There's also a gorgeous vanity, which contributes to the 360-effect, along with an old-fashioned table. (The drawer -- yes, I opened it -- contained an an antique-y postcard from Brussels). I could go on. But then I wouldn't be telling you about the cocktail list. And what a marvelous, well-crafted little cocktail list Mr. McIlroy has created for us to enjoy. After a long day, let the Corpse Reviver No. 2 (gin, Contreau, Lillet blanc, lemon juice and absinthe) breathe some life into you. After doing just this, and sipping several of my friends' delicious selections, I veered off-menu with suggestions from our top-notch server Chase -- first with a blackberry bourbon concoction and then an amazing Morris cocktail (try your hand at one with this recipe: spiritsandcocktails.word…). And let's talk popcorn. Their recipe, we learned, is a secret. Or, as our soft-spoken host Paul informed us, it's just not theirs (I was waiting for him to say ""je ne sais pas"" in his adorable accent, but no luck). It's ""sent from a neighboring establishment"" (Le Petite Abeille). That may have been a euphemism for ""trafficked in from another country,"" because none in our party would've been surprised if it was sprinkled with incredibly addictive, highly-illegal substances. Don't worry, it didn't slow us down. Seriously, I felt like the annoying brother in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe after the Queen gave him Turkish Delight! Speaking of the Queen, I was treated like one all evening, from a gentile kiss on the hand as I walked in, to attentive service accommodating our every need. Unfortunately, my girls had to cool their heels for a few moments outside before joining me. The trade-off for making walk-ins possible here is that reservations aren't, so there's a chance you may wait for a table if you don't arrive early. Later my friend recounted an unfortunate encounter with the coat check attendant. But to me, these issues seemed minor (especially because they didn't happen to me ;-) in light of the overall amazing evening we enjoyed.Now, I know what you're thinking.

I love breakfast for dinner, snacks for dinner, dinner for dinner, even. But we've hit a rough patch in our relationship.Problem one: All too often I find myself eating breakfast at 1 pm. This means lunch might not happen until 7 and dinner might not happen at all. This also means that drinking time might come before lunch time. Drinking on an empty stomach requires speed and agility. It's a task navigated only by masters. Problem two: I am ALWAYS hungry after drinking. It doesn't seem to matter how much I ate before the drinking commenced, when the night's a windin down: I want food. I see it as preventative medicine. The more I eat, the less hungover I feel. This may not seem like a problem per se, but I can't help but think that eating before AND after drinking is a touch..... excessive. The only way I've managed to deal lately is to skip the pre drinking meal, consume carefully and then hit the late night dinner with reckless abandon. I'm talking eggs, hash, bacon AND a toasted blueberry muffin (Yah, I don't mess around).Cosmos Diner, with it's massive menu and greasy breakfasts, has more than once been the light at the end of the Hangover Tunnel.

Cookie Monster let me introduce you to Melomakarona: this spice (Cinnamon, Clove) cookie is a Christmas tradition in Greece and is dipped in a syrup of honey and lemon juice and sprinkled with walnuts. *Poof* Wait, where did it disappear?The Cookie Monster is not the only one who would go Kookie in the middle of so many cookies! I've discovered the only way to figure out what you do and don't like is to pick a pound of assorted cookies. After padding up my waistline, I've realized that I also like Kourambiethes (rich, walnut shortbread) and Kouroulakia (mildly sweet, coffee dunking) cookies. Oh, and the dark chocolate Florentines. Recession worries got you beat? Try their traditional Greek pastries and feel rich, without pulling off a Madoff. You don't need to create a ponzi scheme when you can indulge in different types of Kataifi (shredded phyllo dough, walnuts, honey - including one similar to Knafeh), Galaktoboureko (custard filled phyllo where the custard is baked with the pastry as opposed to a mille-feuille), and Baklava (regular, almond, pistachio, chocolate, fig, coconut).

That's really not a lot especially when comparing this place to something like Ko where the ratio is like 1:$40 or even Kenka (bull penis = wow = $7 = 1:7)We had the tasting menu at the counter and the chef was nice enough to let us substitute the eel and fois, and the quail for a sea bass. So definitely points for letting diners be a little flexible. The amuse, lemon gelee with olives, was OK. The flavors were unique and interesting but wouldn't say it was good. The split pea soup again with lemon gelee was refreshing but didn't like the fact that we had two things back to back with lemon gelee. But no wows there.The langoustine carpaccio was VERY good. No wow because I've had something similar at Ko and Robuchon's restaurant in Macao. Using langoustine was different but the flavor, while great, was very familiar. The scallop was a wow dish. But the scallop wasn't really what made the dish wow, it was actually the pink/purple seaweed garnish that really made the dish. That garnish added a ocean/briny flavor to the sweetness of the scallop while adding a bit of extra texture. Next was the quail and eel which was both very flavorful and rich. A minor Wow but that may have been due to not having fois in a while.Kobe beef was Kobe beef. Cooked well, flavored well.

This place stocks really cute bras by Chantelle, Felina and other brands that will accomodate even my breasteces. They also stock Wacoal, but the cuter styles. They display them freely on the racks, too, unlike other stores, like Azalea's in the East Village (bad review to come), where you have to ask for them to go way back in the stock room and get out the...gasp....DD styles. However, there are some days, like today, when almost every bra in Pink Slip is either padded or can accomodate nothing greater than my fist. Be warned. You might have to hunt sometimes.The panties are adorable. They stock my favorites, the Hanky Panky thongs, which are, by the way, THE most comfortable thongs ever, in all the colors I want. Lucky drawers indeed. Ladies, the hype is true. Don't be scurred to wear these. New colors and styles come out every season, and Pink Slip has them.

This was noteworthy because it is not often that my wife charms anyone: she is Polish and Polish custom is to assume that exhibiting any friendliness is precursor to an invasion.Shang, the aforementioned authentically Chinese waitress greeted us promptly and with no emotion. She seemed neither happy nor sad that we were there - her Yin & Yang were perfectly balanced in indifference. For cocktails I opted for the Kiwi Gimlet. My wife had the Ginger Dragon. My drink made me look a little effete, so I assumed an aggressive posture and tried not to slouch.Shang may or may not have told us about the specials. Her Vulcan-like absence of emotional qualities makes my memory of her somewhat of a blur. It should be noted that her complete absence of facial muscles to indicate pain or pleasure in no way means she was not prompt or able to deliver food items to the table. She was simply Spock with an apron.We ordered a bottle of wine and as often happens the bottle I was brought was two years older than the vintage on the menu. I feigned disappointment and requested the wine list again. I have no idea if the 2006 would have been any better or worse than the 2004 that was on the menu, but I felt it necessary to express displeasure. Ultimately I ordered a bottle that was $2 cheaper - to punish the restaurant for their malfeasance. Shang, as you might expect, remained utterly unfazed.Having been liberated from sexism in 1990 by my angry lesbian, socialist film professors, I was more than willing to allow my wife to choose the dim sum items. She opted for Shrimp & Snow Pea Leaf dumplings, Watercress Dumplings with Shrimp & Pork, the Shrimp & Chicken Lollipops, and things that were shaped like triangles. I added Yang Chow fried rice to the mix because I like saying Yang Chow.The food was excellent and arrived fairly quickly, with the exception of the fried rice. Shang - with any human emotions she may have possessed hidden behind her impenetrable automaton veneer - informed me that it would be coming. Indeed it did eventually arrive, but not until we were finished with all the other dishes. Usually fried rice is an accompaniment - like the Captain to Tennille - in this case it became the entrée - like Tennille just sitting on the piano with no one to sing to. Shang may or may not have cared.I insisted on dessert because I could not resist anything called Peanut Butter Mousse. It was fantastic. I pity the generation of formula-raised children who are now asthmatic, prone to colds and allergic to peanuts.Before we left, the table next to us made our acquaintance and asked if we'd noticed Shang's absolute absence of personality.

Perhaps the most perfect name given to a restaurant that tries to comprise and represent all South American cultures via their respective ethnic foods, for South American history is indeed a game of Rayuela, as bizarre and unorthodox as the famous novel; full of juxtapositions and a desperate urge for consistency and harmony, finding only contradictory chaos, exasperating but beautiful... I observe the posh and elegant décor from the flooring to the roof; old style ironcast mesh farols that allude to its Spanish origins, and brushed wood and suave panelling, which influence could be extracted from any of the cultures which have had a say on the collage of history of the southern cone: Italy, Portugal, Germany, Holland, Spain and most recently the U.S. But in the middle of the restaurant, raw vegetation protrudes through the floor and into the second floor; a tree resembling a South American Ceiba upsets the elegant consistency bringing a wild touch to to the overall composition. My lovely date arrives. I quickly forget about the 25 + minutes of waiting in lieu of the sight for my sore eyes. I blame last paragraph's deconstruction to the wait, or perhaps I should blame it on the delicious Spanish cava.Anyways, we go upstairs, and then the degustation begins. Just like Crema, Rayuela has liberally interpreted classic South American patters, and playfully allocated autoctonous spices and fruits, bringing a carnival of flavor and compositions. Not one platter was lacking in deliciousness, with the exception of the crab and shrimp guacamole especial; the guac was lacking, and I could barely feel the crab, but other than that, the feast that ensued was most exquisite and proper for the ambient and the occasion.We tried three ceviches, the Vieiras con Passion (scallops in passion fruit, mango and citrus) which was very sweet, resembling the classic Ecuatorian shrimp ceviche, which is not particularly my fav, but still good.The Langosta Revolucion was incredible and consisted of Lobster, pineapple, coconut water, ginger and Uruguayan caviar. A true Revolution for the confused palate.And my favorite was the Siete Potencias, which comprised 7 types of seafood in tomatillo sauce. Bitter, delicious, and just perfect.As main platter I had the Duck with Arepa which was glazed in sugar cane and included a pan seared foie grass in the middle of the plate intertwined with the soft corn arepa, bringing a buttery gist that merged together in your mouth. Curiously, they had a mini version of a fried egg (quail perhaps?) which was a distant reminder of a subdued Churrasco.In overall, we left completely satisfied and I somewhat nostalgic for that unfinished chaotic canvas of a continent; the place where at a distance Tomas More conceived his Utopia to be, and Neruda his exile poetry, while I.... just a few short reviews. But just like in Rayuela, who says I can't begin the story at the middle?",20,0.9934

Like getting to a party as everyone leaves but Joe Lieberman in pleated khaki's and you get stuck talking to him - sometimes you're faced with the possibility that maybe you are a loser. It feels the same as not having sex for a year, except when you tell friends about the sex thing they pity you. They don't quite understand the pastry thing. So it's even more baffling to me that every time I go to Marlow and sons, someone in front of me takes the last pressed almond croissant. EVERY TIME. There's never 2 or 3 there's always just one left and the greedy sonofabitch in front takes it.Today I ran in with a friend, and as usual there was 1 left, but no one in line! I pretended I didn't have the weight of a year on my shoulders and casually asked the girl to bag it for me while I perused sea salts and oils. I went into the corner so no one could see my face and began contorting it in some primal victory ritual that I did not fully understand. I think my ancestors disemboweled others for their delicious pastries. It seemed inappropriate that I was fully clothed, unarmed and did not have someone else's blood all over my chest.Anyway, I returned to the counter... and the bag was gone! I looked at the girl.""My pastry,"" I said.She looked at the register dude who was barely present in the same reality. He had put my prized pressed almond croissant into some mystery guy's bag while I was having ancestral DNA flashbacks. I began to interrogate him about the physical characteristics of this mystery guy and which way he went, but it was all vague jive.I'd say don't go to Marlow and Sons for a few days while they clean up the triple murder scene... but shortly after we discovered that register dude hallucinated the mystery guy, and had unbeknownst to all including himself, put it in my friend's shopping bag.

1525,25,20,4.0,"Fire grilled double smoked slab of bacon.Yes. That really cinched it for us this morning. Walking into the establishment was a bit awkward as we had no idea what we were in for, the place was empty, and they were playing really upbeat dance music. Menu looked good but I will admit that I was pretty disappointed that sides were not included in the Brunch special. What you do get is coffee, orange juice/mimosa/bloody mary, and your choice of meal. The man and I ordered the goat cheese and caramelized onion fritatta, which arrived covered with delicious, spicy arugula and pecorino romano cheese.In addition to our main dish we opted for a side of the ~bacon~ and some roasted potatoes. The potatoes weren't really necessary as they are included in frittatas. I will blame it on the fact that my eyes are frequently bigger than my stomach. The bacon was so-so. It was very thick, which I tend to think is best when used with collard greens, brussel sprouts, pastas or chowders. When eating it on its own it can be a little chewy. Luckily it was crispy in some parts. The fritatta was way too big for me to finish, so I ate half but polished off all of the arugula. If you are someone who feels that brunch items are artery clogging disasters the fritatta is a good choice. If you can balance the arugula and egg mess you're good to go. Eating all of that leafy green goodness allowed me to leave 100% guilt free and satisfied. I am excited to try the pizza here, and perhaps one of their meat/cheese plates. They seem to have a lovely selection of local meats and imported cheese. If anyone here knows of Emily's pork store, that's where they get their sausage.BONUS POINTS: All my favorite 80's dance hits were played during our brunch.

1532,13,5,4.0,"Blue Smoke is surprisingly good BBQ in Manhattan. It really is difficult to top the different varieties of BBQ that spring forth from the South after all, that's their thing. But this urban foray into BBQ is admirable and manages to round out solid meat offerings with very good sides and fantastic desserts.In addition to wings (see Fire on the Mountain for my extensive treatment of the subject for more on wings), I'm a BBQ rib fiend. These are two dishes that against my own better judgment I frequently 1) Consume to excess 2) Occasionally baste with excessive quantities of pain inducing hot sauces 3) Order anyway in spite of clearly better menu alternatives either out of habit or simply for the sake of making a comparison. I focus here on the ribs.Blue Smoke offers Kansas City pork ribs, Memphis baby back pork ribs, and Texas beef ribs. I'm generally partial to pork ribs. However, Blue Smoke comes out strong with an understated but well prepared salt and pepper dry rub beef rib. The meat breaks apart nicely and retains enough moisture to give a good mouth feel and texture. The beef flavor presents strongly and has a nice smoky hint to it. If you've primarily had pork ribs that are heavy on sauce, Blue Smoke might provide you with a chance to try a very good beef rib offering.The pork ribs are a curiosity in my view. The KC ribs employ a traditional BBQ sauce applied to spare ribs. By contrast, the Memphis ribs are baby back ribs with the expected minimalist vinegar and tomato based mop sauce. What's strange about this is that I think they would be better off doing the spare ribs Memphis style, where the meat flavor is a little more on display, and the baby back ribs with the KC preparation. Baby back ribs (and short ribs, for that matter) are best served slathered in a sauce or marinade suitable to the heavier KC BBQ sauce.If you're doing ribs at home on the grill, a slathering of KC sauce or something like a Hawaiian or Asian style marinade is great for baby back and short ribs: it's brainless and it tastes great. This works out because those rib cuts aren't the greatest cuts of meat and this preparation tenders and provides a little more pronounced flavor. By contrast, Memphis BBQ preparations are minimalist on sauce and for that reason, the better meat found on the spare rib would really work better. Also, Memphis BBQ is often served with some sauce on the side, which isn't the case at Blue Smoke. For people expecting more on their ribs this might be a bit disappointing.But what do I know? Danny Meyer is the famous chef in this equation, and he's got this (apparently) respected pit guy, Kenny Callaghan, working the meat. With that little digression aside, a couple remarks on the pork ribs themselves are in order.First off, they're both good. The Memphis baby back ribs are slight in the sauce department but they remain moist and tender. The rub (""Magic Dust"" they call it) brings out a nice flavor and the sauce provides a pleasant, but not overpowering complement. I think I'm partial to those over the KC preparation, which is also good although not mind-blowingly awesome. Again, tender and moist with a sauce that provides a sweet BBQ flavor without drowning out the meat. In both cases, the meat comes off the bone nicely, although it doesn't quite slide off, as though melting away, like you'll find with some truly sublime ribs.Invariably when it comes to ribs, there's always a contingent of people who say you can't possibly call [these ribs] good compared to what you get in [insert Southern region here]. Those people then apply the absurdly faulty reasoning that the ribs in question are therefore terrible, and call it one star. The only tripe around here is that position. Don't jive me with that cosmic debris.The ribs are good, even by national standards. The premium that you're paying might feel a bit high based on the meat alone, especially compared to what you picked up one time at Tyrone's Pit, where he's got the trailer set up and once the meat runs out in the afternoon you're out of luck. This isn't Tyrone's Pit though, and it isn't a shack in Smalltown, South. On ribs alone, these are good and probably some of the best you'll find in Manhattan. The portions are quite good as well, so that's a plus. I didn't eat dinner after lunch at Blue Smoke.The sides are important because whatever complaints one might have with the meat, the sides are exceptional. I know a woman who doesn't like BBQ at all, but likes Blue Smoke because of the sides. The macaroni is a creamy, gooey, delicious treat. That's the must-have item on the sides. Sweet potato fries, mashed potatoes, and greens receive high marks as well. Kudos for the deviled egg appetizer as well.Finally, and importantly, dessert should not be skipped. Blue Smoke has a dedicated pastry chef who makes obscenely decadent desserts. The ice cream is homemade everyday, so don't be bashful ordering ""just ice cream.""",17,0.9992
1533,31,29,4.0,"Warning: I am a complete Debbie Downer when it comes to Korean food (amongst many other things). I can't help myself. I ate this 365 days a year (we had kimchi next to the turkey in Thanksgiving, oh yeah), and I ate it for cheap. So I can't help it if my standard for good Korean food is not only high but attached to a low price tag. So most of my complaints here are based on that background ... now that you've been warned ... on with the review!We got the Kimchi-Pajun for appetizers. Pajun can be best described as a savory Korean pancake; the batter is much less sweeter than the American equivalent's, and vegetables and other toppings (in this case, kimchi) are incorporated into the actual batter itself. I suppose everyone has their own preference when it comes to the crispiness of pajun, but I'm a big fan of crispy edges, but soft everywhere else. The batter itself has flavor, especially if you were to get something like the kimchi-pajun, and when it's way too crispy, the flavor is lost as the crunch becomes the overwhelming factor. Unfortunately, the kimchi-pajun from Do-Hwa was too crispy and a bit too oily. Yeah, the thing is fried to begin with and I probably can't complain too much, but it seemed that the pajun was too carelessly fried so that the batter took into too much oil. What I liked most about this place was the small dishes. In Korean cuisine, the rice is the base, and it is supplemented by not only the main dishes but also couple of small dishes that, in most Korean restaurant etiquette, are free. Do Hwa has the best small dishes I've had so far in any New York Korean restaurant. They were also generous with the portions and number of dishes. I believe there were about seven or eight, and each came in good amounts.-The kimchi was well fermented (crucial) and had just enough kick. -There was also sweet black beans; this dish doesn't vary too much, but it was a dish that I hadn't seen in a while and was happy to eat. I used to love these when I was little. -While the tofu of the seasoned tofu was a bit tough, the seasoning was nearly perfect. To be fair, this dish isn't made with silky tofu, but the more rough blocks, but it was still a bit too chewy, which is a gross feature in tofu. -The marinated bean sprouts were really delicious. They were not only fresh and crisp (I love that crunch of the stalks), but had a real good marinade with a subtle kick. It wasn't too oily as this dish can be sometimes, nor was it over-spiced. I wasn't feeling too hungry (and possibly too cheap to pay for dishes that I knew I shouldn't be priced so highly) so I only got the dduk-bbok-kki (spicy rice cakes). There's really no equivalent of spicy rice cakes in America, but in terms of their social value... they're like the great American hotdog. They're bar food, party food, cheap food, get-together food, crowd pleaser food, and it just goes on. Spicy rice cakes were good. I was worried that they wouldn't make it spicy enough (I was weaned on cayenne paste, not milk, thank you very much), but it was plenty spicy. The rice cakes were soft and slightly sticky (they way they should be; jjol-ki, jjol-ki--if yu know what that means), and retained the sauce really well. They even had a sliced hard-boiled egg. Yummy! My only qualm was this sucker was $13 and it had very few rice cakes and no fish cakes. Seriously? You see... spicy rice cakes are instant crowd pleasers, but they're really cheap and super easy to make. Don't believe me? Here's the recipe: Ingredients: rice-cakes, red pepper paste, sugar, water (water could be replaced with broth); optional: fish cake, hard-boiled eggs, ramen noodles, spam, diced cabbage, sliced scallions, etc.. 1) Boil rice cakes in water so that they get soft. 2)Meanwhile, in another pan (or inside the first pan if you're lazy like I), boil water/broth (I personally loved it when my mommy used left over ox-tail broth to make this) 3) Add red pepper paste and sugar to taste to the water/broth4) When rice cakes are softened, add to water/broth5) Keep at high to medium temperature till the water/broth is thickened 6) Add optional ingredients (note: add fish cakes a bit earlier with the rice cakes, add COOKED and drained ramen noodles... not dry) And really, that's what it came down to for me at Do-Hwa. It was a great place with subtly luxurious atmosphere (loved the decorative clay pots), excellent service, and pretty darn good Korean food, but being the cheap-o than I am, I can't help but balk at the price ... especially when I can make half of this at home. I'd give it three stars, but their service was amazing. They were friendly, helpful, and even a bit funny. Besides, I had a good time with my friend, but why wouldn't I? He's a Raiders fan and a socialist (like yours truly)--total recipe for non-stop fun.",35,0.9992

Since the time I started sampling them (May) they have increased the frosting, substantially. And, when the frosting is THAT good, one can have no complaints with getting more. My favorite is the carrot cupcake with salted caramel frosting. The carrot cake is soft and moist, with a lime cream cheese filling and a caramel frosting made even better with a pinch of sea salt! Didn't I say these aren't your run-of-the-Magnolia cupcakes?Other uncommon flavors that work well include: Green tea (chocolate cupcake with strong matcha green tea frosting and a filling of apricot preserves); Strawberry Coconut (colorful, fruity, sweet, and tart - thanks to a moist coconut cake with strawberry frosting and Rhubarb Compote filling); Dragon Devil's Food (buttermilk cake, Caramel filling, Valrhona Chocolate frosting, Valrhona chocolate pearls). Their velvet cake is a Beet-Strawberry cake (no food coloring!) chocolate fudge filling, cream cheese frosting.Now a word of caution: ALL the cupcakes are refrigerated and I would advise a wait of at least 30 minutes to an hour before consuming them.

They are the most innovative, and MUCH MUCH superior to the other Southeast Asia-meets-West Dessert magician's 'mass productions' at Chikalicious puddin'. The Mango Thai Tea Pudding with Fresh Mango Puree, Mascarpone Sabayon, Thai Tea Soaked Sponge Cake, Lime Zest, and Chocolate shavings is excellent. I've loved it!! Another exceptional choice is the Huckleberry Chevre Pudding: with walnut butter cookie, chevre ""Cheesecake"" and Huckleberry sauce. Smooth and tangy. It's like having a creamy cheesecake in a cup!I am not a big fan of the Ovaltine Pudding, even though it has many components that remind one of the wonders of childhood: ovaltine pudding, (caramelized) Rice Krispies, Chocolate 'soil', together with Vanilla bean Chantilly.The ONE area where Batch performs abysmally is cookies. While they have the entire range: chocolate chip, sweet and salty peanut butter, Ginger raisin oatmeal, along with brownies, and blondies - I am not a fan. Not even of the much critically acclaimed Yuzu shortbread. I suspect that these items don't see much turnover and so aren't the freshest in the shop. Instead, the macarons placed in the shop by Pichet Ong's friend, Hsing Chen, and selling under the name of Sweet Chick NYC are a much better option. They are a bit crumbly for my advocacy, but their flavors are true and their colors: vibrant.Pichet Ong may finally have found the magical formula for commercial success that has eluded him since leaving Jean Georges' kitchen. Many months back I had tried P*ong (limping along next door) with one of yelp's most surgical reviewers, Tam N, and we had both been thoroughly disappointed with our experience.

Alas, it has not been the case, as the distribution of eateries in the neighborhood range from cheap and pre-fab to fabulous and expensive, with few places finding a happy medium. Fortunately the Frijoles gods must have been listening to my cries when they dispatched a taco truck to my neighborhood. Parking itself on weekdays right outside the 86th and Lexington 4 5 6 station, this saintly mobile muchacho bestows its providence of tortas, sopes, tacos and more to the hardworking locals. Prices range from $2.50 (taco) to around $7 (burritos and quesadillas), with discounts occasionally offered for flirting.  Choose from more meats than you knew existed and be prepared to taste the nectar of the gods.To tell you the truth, I can't quite remember how any of us got by before Paty's Taco Truck delivered the area from darkness.

I do love Candle as an institution, if that makes sense... a classic, high-quality, but laid-back, completely vegan restaurant that doesn't try too hard, isn't in-your-face-PETAish, and offers good value and reliable fare.Other stuff: Juice drinks are zesty and fresh.

1541,17,32,4.0,"My wife and I were looking for a melamine-free dining experience and we weren't disappointed. Our waitress Ayasha greeted us promptly, took our cocktail order and promptly returned with a round of melamine-free margaritas.My wife, who is afraid of getting fat, ordered a side of roast tomatoes and the tuna tartar appetizer for her dinner. She claims it was all delicious and she tends not to lie. I am assuming her dinner was untainted by melamine-toting Chinese industrialists, and I think she'd agree.For my starter I had the Chopped Salad which was thoroughly excellent. For a main I went with the roast Pork tenderloin. Was it good? Well, if I had a gallery in my house in which hung pictures of my favorite pork tenderloins, I would definitely hang a picture of this dish in it. But I do not have such a gallery as my wife would frown upon such excess. Suffice to say the pork was so good that even if Chinese industrialists had coated it with melamine - which they didn't - I would still devour it, which I did.We were too stuffed to consider dessert. As we were leaving I shook my fist at the waitress and hissed ""You were lucky this time, but we'll see you again dearie-o!"" which in retrospect was probably construed as threatening. I was merely trying to convey my enjoyment of Mesa's food and service in the style of someone with limited social skills.",15,0.9103
1542,12,8,4.0,"With 189 reviews and counting, it's nice to see that every review is comprised of different meals.We sat upstairs which is much more lighted than the downstairs. Italian sayings are framed on the walls, there is a giant skylight, white wainscoting lines the yellow walls, the tables are tiny, and a large treelike centerpiece sits directly under the skylight. The stairs also adorn a typical Florentine pattern. We settled on the traditional tasting menu. The menu at Babbo is really expansive. We thought the traditional menu would give us the best overall experience of Babbo. One thing I may add is that the waiter at Babbo asked if we had any food allergies. Embarrassed we held back and did not tell him that we were allergic to milk and eggs. What would be the point of coming to Babbo? We wouldn't be able to eat anything!! Luckily, there were no allergic reactions and no trips to the emergency room. Complimentary was the bread. It was really rustic, cold and hard. Flavorless. That was followed by a spicy chickpea bruschetta. Really good.The first dish of the tasting menu was the Babbo Culatello with Fiddleheads and Pecorino. Culatello is the heart of proscuitto. It was pretty fatty but good. If you've never had Fiddleheads, then you will probably have the same expression as me. ""WTF is that??"" Fiddleheads are actually the part of a fern before it uncoils and leaves. They look really unappetizing. Almost like I've been served tiny pieces of intestines. Bleh. But they had no flavor and it was basically used for texture. Salty culatello, sharp shavings of pecorino cheese and crunchy fiddleheads. It was a first dish punch as if we needed a little waking up at 8:45 PM.The second dish was Pappardelle with Morels and Thyme. Now that we were awake, we were served the comforts of a thin pasta with flavorful morels. The sauce on the pasta looked like it could be rich but it was actually extremely light with just butter and thyme. The morel flavor was very over powering. If you are a mushroom fan, you will be pleased. I was loving it.Next up was Duck Tortelli with Sugo Finto. This was a pasta with red sauce and the duck wasn't as strong of a flavor as the morels. Sugo finto is a mock meat sauce. This dish was a slight let down from the previous (which was outstanding).Pork Tender with Barlotto Verde and Caper Vinaigrette was our entree and it was cooked perfectly. I have never had a piece of pork so tender and juicy. It was served with mashed green peas. The peas were an excellent pairing to the pork tender. Just imagine green mashed potatoes. And the sauce of the dish, there just wasn't anything left when we were done. The pork tender was my favorite of all the dishes.Slowing it down, we realized we were on a roller coaster of traditional tastes. We had some highs and lows and just about stuffed we were about to embark on the dessert journey. At this time, the runner had taken away our crumbs and laid out napkins on top of our table to hide our stains from us eating sloppy because we were overly excited about the food. Instant new tablecloth!Coach Farm's Finest with Fennel Honey was a soft cheese served with fennel infused honey. The waiter drizzled the honey on to our plates. If you've ever had Fage greek yogurt with honey, Babbo's cheese with fennel honey is like version 5.0. Oh man it is good stuff and not as rich. We were given a plate of warm crostini which amounted to about two pieces each. We were able to spread some cheese on our bread but all left overs were eaten straight. Mmmmm. Batali's other restaurant Otto serves a similar dish of soft cheese and fruit. It's a poor man's Coach Farm's Finest but a nice introduction to the wonderful cheeses served at Batali's restaurants.At the sixth dish, Crema con Mosto, we were ready to be delirious. We had lost count of which dish we were on and what was left. At this point, we didn't know what else we could be surprised on. Crema con Mosto was custard with grape infused oil. It was a bit like creme brulee without the hard top. I took a tiny nibble and stayed away. Too many egg yolks for me.The chocolate Tartufino was a chocolate lover's dream. It was a new spin on tartufo and had a cherry in the middle. Our last dish was quite a surprise. Instead of just a Coconut Sabbiosa with Blueberries and Coconut Gelato, we were each given a different dessert ranging from cheesecake and blueberry crumble to apple cake and saffron infused panna cotta. We were about to jump on our seats ecstatic.Babbo really wowed us but I think it is just 4 stars. Some of the dishes didn't really stand out and our waiter didn't explain the menu to us like he did to other tables. Babbo is good but not as good as it's reputation builds it to be.This review is dedicated to Tabb Y aka the ghost writer for Johnny C (I shall expose you!). Tab, I will take you to Babbo one day provided I know you are coming to NYC 1 month and a 1/2 in advance.",16,0.9982

Pass by Lemongrass Grill and feel disdain for those seen eating there.2. Read the headlines of all three major newspapers outside of the 24-hr deli (I don't like to watch the news and I'd hate to miss out on something important, like Osama Bin-Laden finally being captured or Britney shaving her head again).3. Read the Flavors of the Day on the Tasti-D-Lite chalkboard parked on the sidewalk.4.

Stop in Staubitz Meat Market and buy some ground or sliced turkey while being ogled by the butchers.6. Visit The Community Bookstore.Some habits are born out of circumstances and some are born out of your family's mode de vie. My father used to always take to me to bookstores with him as a kid, and I've been drawn to them ever since. The Community Bookstore is special though. You half expect to find a doorway to Narnia behind some decrepit shelf in this place. An A-type personality's nightmare, this store is one huge, organized-disorderedly shrine to all types of written word. I love it here. Most books are used, though some are new. Whenever I feel lost and lacking direction in some way, I have always had luck with the right book finding me here. There is no place to sit, so it's hard to stay long. A quick 5-10 minute perusal will do. And there's nothing like the possibility of a long, lonely night ahead of you to make you think about sitting at home with a good book (""Either that or having a nice bottle of wine!,"" said the L.V. ""You are not helping,"" I told her).The owner was there, trying to stay in the background, not making much conversation, as usual. Smoking a cigarette outside from time to time. He is older, but not yet old. And I seem to recall hearing that his wife is from France. Also, that she is confined to a wheelchair. (""How romantic,"" said the Little Voice,""he sticks by her throughout the years. Maybe we'll find someone like that for us one day, you know?"", ""Not at this rate, baby.""

""Oh brother,"" said the L.V., ""Check your phone again, maybe there's a message.""""Yeah right,"" I say, ""I would have felt it vibrate in my pocket if that was the case."")

1545,17,12,4.0,"You might want to brush up on your Italian before you come here. I consider myself a fairly savvy diner, but definitely not savvy enough to know what most of the items were on the menu. We asked our waiter to explain the menu to us, and he kinda zoomed through it like he's given this tour a million times a week (which he probably has). As cheesy as this sounds, having a glossary on the menu would have been really helpful and saved both the waiter and us some time.There are several different types of small plates - paninis, salads, antipasti (okay, those are the easy ones), plus fried dishes, veggies and tea sandwiches. If we hadn't had a time crunch (we were seeing a show around the corner) and we knew what all the ingredients were, we probably would have been a little more adventurous. So we played it pretty safe, but still came out pretty satisfied.The waiter suggested two dishes per person, but we decided on three to start. We ended up getting pretty full on the three and never ordered a fourth, so that's a good sign. We ordered one tea sandwich (mozzarella and tapenade), one panini (prosciutto, pesto, pomodoro) and one salad (grilled calamari). The calamari salad tasted very fresh and light - my friend said it would be a perfect summer time dish. The bread in the tea sandwich was so soft and airy - I could have been happy just eating that with some olive oil. The panini had the most delicious crunch to it - definitely the best I've ever had.The service was a bit absent-minded, especially considering we got there pretty early, before it started to fill up. By the time we left, most of the tables were taken and it became even harder to catch our waiter's attention. This probably isn't such an issue if you plan on lingering over your meal like most people do at tapas/wine bars, so I don't think I'd recommend this for a quick meal.We didn't get a chance to try the wine - the book was pretty thick and intimidating, and I'm quite the novice when it comes to wine. And the selection of cheeses also sounded very enticing (the waiter said he could put together a plate for us). But I look forward to coming back here and spending much more time exploring the menu, as well as the wine list.",17,0.9982

In my defense, there are a ton of microbrews that I've never heard of, and certainly more than a few unappetizing names (Moose Drool, Dead Guy Ale, Santa's Butt Porter, to name a few).

1548,35,17,4.0,"Standing on 10th Street I watched the cool November wind swirl through the trees. Straining with bending limbs, the old trees that lined the park danced. The sound of the dry, but not ready to fall leaves, were all that was in my ears. Two girls on skates rolled up a few yards away. One began to dance as the other took pictures with an old film camera. I looked at them smiling, wondering. What would these pictures look like?Ro and Theresa were late, but I didn't mind. 10th Street on Tompkins Square is one of my favorite in the City. Beyond the dancing skater I saw my friends appear. We entered Gnocco through a large glass and gun metal black steel door, walking past the pizza ovens and left into a bar area. To the front and back there are nice little tables with candles burning.We sat at two of the tin topped tables that were pushed together. I felt slightly awkward and recommended we order a bottle of wine. I picked a Montepulciano D'Abruzzo. Ro and Theresa know each other very well. I've only met them on two occasions previously. After the first glass the awkwardness dispersed. The Montepulciano was smooth and dry, and we were ready to order.To start we ordered Pizza Bufalina (fresh bufala mozzarella, cherry tomatoes and basil trickled with olive oil). It came out very quickly, but yet it was not hot enough. It was really an extraordinary pizza, barring its temperature. The crust was thin and baked to my liking. The Bufala was flavorful and it went down easy and quickly, followed by swallows of the Montepulciano.For main we each ordered a pasta dish, though they have a full selection of meat dishes. Ro ordered the Campanella ai Fungi Porcini (porcini mushrooms with a touch of cream). Theresa got the Tagliatelle Con Prosciutto (braised prosciutto with green peas and light cream). I wanted to try their Gnocci, so for me it was the Gnocchetti (with beef and veal ragu).When our order came we all push our plates toward the center and shared. Out of the three main dishes mine was agreed to be our least favorite. The Gnocci itself was perfect and soft, but the sauce lacked flavor and was on the sweet side. Theresa's Tagliatelle was the second favorite, though she complained that the prosciutto was a little too salty. I liked it and helped her along. Ro's Campanella was the stand out favorite. The fresh pasta was complimented by the mushrooms and cream.We shared one dessert. Ro chose the Creme brulee. It was nothing really memorable, but it was perfectly satisfactory though lacking something I could not distinguish. We paid the bill and walked back out into the blustery night. Theresa got into a cab and disappeared up the 1st Avenue and I walked Ro home. It was a good evening, though the food didn't meet our expectations. Gnocco is a good place, but there are other choices that I would select over it for better Italian cuisine. Being that it's only two blocks from my apartment I can see myself on a lazy night returning to try some other dishes.",21,0.997
1549,18,25,4.0,"Let me caveat this review by saying that I recently did a 3 week detox. No meat, no dairy, no booze, no caffeine, and nothing cooked. Nothing but raw fruits, veggies, and nuts. The day after I got off this diet, my boy from Philly took me out to celebrate my detox by retoxing at 99 Miles to Philly. The fact that I hadn't had meat or cheese in almost a month may have influenced this review.The place is very small and can get a bit crowded. They have a big screen TV which helps pass the time while you wait. We found a seat after a little while and the place cleared up after 5 or 10 minutes. It seems like a lot of people just come here for take out. I got a cheesesteak ""wit onions"", (cheese) ""wiz"", lettuce, tomatoes, and green peppers. Did anyone else know that adding lettuce and tomatoes make it a hoagie? We also split an order of onion rings which were quite good.This was the best hoagie I've ever had and in the discussion for being one of the Top 5 sandwiches I've ever had. I don't know what kind of bread they use but it was incredible. Perfectly spongy and soft. My boy told me they use the authentic Philly cheesesteak bread.Everything about this sandwich was good. They lovingly douse the steak ""wit wiz"" so every bite has that almost sexual goodness to it. They put the perfect amount of onions and peppers in it and the lettuce and tomato were fresh and delicious. I also love how they put the condiments on while the sandwich is extremely hot and press down on it. When you get it, it's not steak AND onions AND wiz AND lettuce AND tomatoes.

Let the folks at Lure know you use a wheelchair - call ahead, send someone in. On the Mercer side of the restaurant there is a service entrance that leads to an elevator that takes you downstairs. The staff was quick to help and friendly, the service entrance was clean, well lit and the elevator was big. There's also an accessible bathroom downstairs. So Lure is not just accessible, it's very accessible. There are already too many restaurants and shops that aren't accessible in NYC, by saying a place isn't when it is only causes more confusion. Now on to the food. I can't truly judge Lure's full menu because I was there with a 20+ party honoring someone and we all ordered from a 3-course prix fixe menu. I ordered the shrimp cocktail that arrived with 4 meaty, fresh shrimp and a tangy cocktail sauce as well as mustard. For my main it was the Branzino filet. Very nicely cooked, skin on with a very subtle herb sauce. Dessert was the strawberry rhubarb crisp which was really, really good. The decor is kinda like an old wooden Chris Craft speed boat.

We both had Pad Thai for our entrees. Lots of chicken and noodles cooked perfectly. I don't know if everything was better because I was hungry and liquored up but does it really matter? I loved the ambiance of this small place. Something about the close tables in a dark room in the middle of January spoke to me.

Not b/c the pommes frites and dipping sauces aren't tasty but when does one just eat a big wedge of fried potatoes? (even the small here is pretty filling)This place reminds me of the days I spent in Amsterdam and Brussels during my semester abroad. Stands in all the touristy areas just selling pommes frites and maybe a waffle wedge. Finding an excuse to snack was easy - we were drunk (on culture!) and/or high (on, uh, culture!) and/or too poor (in money!) to afford a real meal.Pommes Frites measures up well to the memories of those old stands. They measure up a hell of a lot better than NY coffee shops measure up to their Dutch counterparts.Pommes Frites does these Dutch/Belgian stands of my memories one better by having an alternative to mayo. Really like the mango chutney dipping sauce - reminds me of the Mango sauce at Blue 9 Burger.How are the pommes frites? I think they are very good. Then again, I only go here when I'm drunk.So if you want a flashback (the good type) to your travels to Amsterdam or Belgium or really like savory snacks/french fries, seek this place out.

This may be part of the bigger plans, which also include expansion into the neighboring property.In closing, White Star's worth the trip if only to enhance your absinthe education, surrounded by a beautiful bar ambiance and friendly folks who appreciate spirited evenings.P.S.

In DSW, where most of the shoes are about $70, I unfailingly home in on the one pair of boots that turn out to be Prada and $600. Last night, this special talent proved to hold up when it comes to booze as well. Yay for special talents!At PDT, most of the cocktails are $12, and I somehow managed to order the one that was $22. $22 for one drink! There should be some sort of confirmation step with this drink, like when you're about to buy something online and you get a little window that's like, ""are you sure you want to make this purchase?"". I needed that last night.The magical drink in question was the Staggerac, a twist on the classic Sazerac but made with George T Stagg bourbon. I'd read somewhere that Stagg was the classic bourbon-drinker's bourbon, and was very excited when I saw it in the menu to finally be able to try it. Unfortunately, this was the tail end of a long night of boozing (kicked off at Yelp's DYL!) and I didn't see that I had turned to the cocktails-for-millionaires page of the menu. Moral of the story here: do not go to PDT when you are already drunk, it's a complete waste.

1560,17,26,4.0,"I admit...I'm a total prude. I don't particularly like to see other people naked except in a bedroom or a computer screen (once in a while...ok more than once in a while).When my friends said we were going to this Korean dayspa complex in Queens that was written up in the new york times, I was excited. I got a full body scrub in Ktown 2 years ago and felt great afterwards. We took the 7 train all the way to end and hopped onto the shuttle bus.My excitement dipped just a bit when I learned that we would all have to get naked to use the hot tubs and saunas adjacent to the locker room. I had just met these friends recently so I was a bit wary of elevating our friendship in this particular way. We sucked in our stomachs, disrobed, and let it all hang out. The first 10 minutes was a bit weird but by the end of the day, it almost became second nature. I really liked the saunas and hot tubs adjacent to the locker rooms. The co-ed saunas on the 2nd level were nice but with so many people and kids running in and out of them, it was hard to unwind. The themed saunas (gold, mineral, salt) were kitchy but fun. No cash is required in the spa. As you walk in, you are given a wristband that opens your own locker and allows you to run up a tab.I got a full body scrub ($50 additional) which was a bit harsh but my elbows have never felt so smooth!! All of us were marveling at how smooth and shiny our skin looked.I highly recommend bypassing the deli food on the 2nd level and going up to the Korean restaurant at top. It's not super expensive and it's decent Korean food. I didn't particularly care for the public pools because of the crowds. If I can avoid chlorine, I'm happy. The pools adjacent to the locker room are not chlorinated, I believe.I'm not sure how these baths are in Korea but it felt like it wasn't too dumbed down for American tastes. I appreciate integrity and the chance to experience something different. The recap:1. Get ready to see a lot of dick (or vag) in 1 day. Even for a gay man, it was a lot.2. Get the full body scrub...your skin will be amazing afterwards provided you still have some. 3. Go on a weekday if you can, it was definitely a bit crowded on the Sat. I was there.4.

That we were taking up so much space in their restaurant, yet not even eating or drinking, didn't seem to bother them in the least.

Since they charge for uneaten fish and/or rice, being wasteful was not an option. Filling out our sushi cards kinda felt like taking a test. We were given #2 pencils and we had to write our names at the top. It was actually kinda fitting since this was an evening with high school friends. And just like high school, we all kinda glanced over each other's shoulders and whispered, ""What did you put down?"" as if you could get a wrong answer. I actually did do a bit of strategizing. I focused more on the sushi so as not to get filled up on the rolls. I thought the sushi was pretty good, and they give fairly large cuts of fish. I can happily say that I got my money's worth of sushi.We ended up spending 3 hours here, but time flew fast as we were all catching up.

There is a nice bar and lounge area up front, and I think you can order food there too - so it's a nice option if you happen to not have that resrvation.We had: the wood-oven-baked mozzarella wrapped in ham, spicy octopus, suckling pig, and orchietta with mussels. All this accompanied by two bottles of the basilicata white. All the food was good - not amazingly mind-blowing good, but definitely solid. I enjoyed it all. The cheese appettizer was probably the least memorable dish. The suckling pig was tender with a good piece of crackled skin on top. It was a tad salty, however. The pasta dish was indeed perfectly cooked, and the mussels had a wonderful creamy texture; a little oily, but you fail to notice after a short while.The wine list is really nice - with bottles ranging from as low as $22 to as high as I think $150 or so. Great variety of lots of regions I have not seen before, but I definitely recommend the basilicata. It is moderately priced and was sweet, without being overly sweet, and dry all at once. Perfecto, if I may say so in imperfect italian.The dinner menu being all in Italian is a drag, and you really have to listen carefully when the server translates. Certainly worth having an Italian speaker on board so you can make less gut reaction decisions. If you can get your hands on one online or something, it's worth previewing. It is a pretentious and stupid thing really.Oh yes, how could I forgot, Uncle JT did not fail to let the lady have her desserts (yes two of them). We had the panacotta and the bread pudding. Both were really quite splendid and not worth skipping over. Overall, a lovely experience afforded to me by a lovely man. The decor and atmosphere is energetic and bustly - contributed by the open kitchen where you can view the wood burning oven. There is a bit of a buzz about so not really the most romantic spot, although there were plenty of hand-holders around us dotted among jovial groups of diners. Occasionally you can hear some opera music peek in from the background. The service was good, but could have been a bit more attentive. The bathrooms are a bit annoying, being only two single-serve bathrooms for the entire restaurant, I did notice lines for both the men's and ladies'.

1578,30,36,4.0,"Y'know, I've been holding off on my 100th Yelp review because I wanted to write something that was positive, local and reasonably relevant to my quality of life. That's taken a while, because a lot of my great experiences recently have been out of town or in places I already love and already reviewed. And here comes Babeland to the rescue. Babeland just opened up their fourth store in my neighborhood. And if there's ever a boutique, specialty store that I NEEEED in my neighborhood, it's a good sex shop. I don't have dogs, so the 6 different yuppie puppy places can shutter themselves without affecting my quality of life. I don't eat frozen yogurt, so the dozen places with ""fro"" and/or ""yo"" in the names and bright orange and green window graphics bore me. Designer baby stores? Pffft. If I had a baby, I'd sell it to Michael Jackson so I could make rent. But Babeland? Babeland is an awesome neighborhood feature. Now I'll never need to spend a buzzkill of an hour on the round trip subway ride to get decent lube. And they stock a variety of good quality condoms! My nearest bodega has a bad habit of melting and refreezing their ice cream, so I don't exactly trust them with the little latex guardians of my childfree lifestyle. Babeland has air conditioning and a competent staff. Their toy selection is one of the world's best. Most items in stock are very high quality (and appropriately priced) and geared towards women and men who know what they want. Newcomers and cheapskates might want to start by buying a bunch of inexpensive toys from somewhere cheap & sleazy and then come back to Babeland when they know WHY they really need the $90+ elastomer Rabbit Habit. (It's because the elastomer is hypoallergenic and the Japanese manufacturer is to Doc Johnson what Peter Luger is to McDonalds.) If you're eyeballing anything in the less-than-$50 range here, there's a good chance you can get the same item for much less elsewhere -- the Orchid G wand is $22 from Babeland, or $3-$8 at roadside sex shops in Pennsyltucky or $10-$12 at lower profile shops in Chelsea. So how does Babeland Brooklyn compare to the Manhattan counterparts?- The staff is friendly and greeted us with a smile when we entered.- The toy displays are as tidy and user friendly as in the LES and SoHo stores. After 10 days of people shoving their grubby hands in the artificial vaginas, the Fleshlights here are just as filthy as the ones on Rivington. (I have to admit, I did it too. ""Penis envy"" wasn't really in my vocabulary until that toy.)- The seriously boutique-y, pricey designer vibes need to be plugged in or have operating batteries at all times. Who's gonna buy a $130 vibe if they don't know how strong it is? - The reading selection needs some work. Mainly, there isn't one. - The store feels more sterile than their other locations. Maybe it's the cold, white paint. Maybe it's just that it's so new. (Nope. Pretty sure it's the paint.)",37,0.9921
1579,31,31,4.0,"I've been in an open relationship for over two years now. It all began as a matter of convenience, but I have to admit, I've grown fond of him. And though I've imagined that in my youth I'll be seeing someone a little more hip and trendy, I have to admit that I've fallen for his quirks, quiet nature, and intelligence. But if I have one complaint, it's that we never go anywhere nice to eat. It's always the same old General Tso's chicken at the cheap Chinese place or the same sandwich and fries at the deli. So every now and then...I see others. Woah, woah, woah! Before we get really excited here about my infidelity, I should confess that my significant other is my neighborhood--Morningside Heights. And while I adore the little eccentricities of the ""New York Acropolis,"" the dining scene is on the sad side of mediocre; eating out means getting bad Chinese food from Ollie's or eating a NYPD sub from Hamilton Deli or such. Grabbing coffee is even worse, as the best place for coffee in the neighborhood (Oren's) doesn't even have a place to sit. No wonder I'm forced to cheat on my neighborhood! And that's why Max Cafe is such a nice surprise--it's a little bit of downtown here in boring old Morningside Heights. It's just when like when you thought you knew your significant other, had accepted the fact that's he's not into fancy things, and he pulls a little trick like this. Max Cafe is a gorgeous little cafe up in Amsterdam Avenue with pretty good food and decent drinks. While most places in the neighborhood didn't put too much into the decor, Max Cafe is a aesthete's delight. A great dark wood French window opens up nearly half the store to the beautiful afternoon sun. In companion to the revealed brick walls that's now the norm for any establishment trying to put on a picturesque front, the cafe also utilizes the lush carmine red paint and velvet curtains to give off a feel of a bohemian decadence. A gorgeous press tin ceiling with intricate embossments is made to look slightly rusted. Antique-looking lighting fixtures dot the store. Wine bottles are displayed along the walls and ad to the charm. The seating is made up plush and luxurious antique-looking sofas; though visibly worn down, the Rococo inspired furniture still hold a sense of opulence. The food is really great cafe food. Though it's a bit high end for Morningside Heights (Chinese food central) standards, it's also one of the better light meals you could find in the neighborhood. I'm a huge fan of the parma panini; a lovely and delicious ciabatta bread is sliced horizontally across, dressed with delicate extra virgin olive oil, toasted, and then pressed with flavorful prosciutto, milky mozzarella, and fresh basil. It also comes with a side of salad; though simple and with few ingredients, it's delicious because its balsamic dressing is amazingly tart yet sweet, simple, and light. The coffee is alright. They're espresso is standard and what you would expect from a cafe that doesn't specialize in coffee; not the most select beans, not the best foam, but still drinkable. As for their regular American coffee, I've had some good cups, and I've also had some awful sour cups. Their wines are unremarkable and prices are New York cafe standard. The wines aren't the best ever, but they're very much enjoyable nonetheless, and Max Cafe is a great place for a glass of wine around dusk as the place brings out small candles; I end up here on early evenings when my friends and I want a nice quiet place for a drink, but are too burnt out for a trip down town. This place is also the best place for a date around here. Most of the time, the place is relaxed and buzzing with a small crowd; whether it's wine or coffee, Max Cafe is always a pleasant place to be.  But if my dear Morningside Heights has such a darling place, why do I cheat? I think there's some incongruence issues of the store that makes it uncomfortable at times. Part of it is that it feels out of place at Morningside Heights. In the morning and early afternoon, you'll find studious customers trying to read or working on their computers; while this maybe the norm at most cafes, Max Cafe is actually an awful place to catch up on work as the lighting is bad, the music (while great) is a little too loud, and the tables are always uncomfortably low in comparison to the sofas. Don't get me wrong, I love Morningside Heights, but a girl needs a change of scenery now and then. Besides, it's not like Morningside Heights is the victim here; my neighborhood cheats on me with grad students and Barnard girls.",27,0.9991

I will admit that Webster Hall has always impressed me and it was our club of choice after Limelight closed again...and again...and again.Webster Hall became our frequent spot on many occasions and it was mainly for the atmosphere and music. Don't even get me started on the space of this place. It's huge as hell!!

That was the ONLY thing I didn't like about Limelight. No space to dance sometimes.In Webster Hall, you can take over on the dance-floor especially in the main ballroom. We would do rooms by nights. One night, we would be in the 80's room for 5 hours just fucking having fun, man. The next night, on the stage for the whole night in the main ballroom. That stage was meant for me and my glow-sticks. No doubt.Fellas, you ever notice when you bring girls to this spot, how long before they're gawking at the all-beef male go-go dancers?

Also, I'm not doing the same dance move all night long, but that's cool; you go on with ""Mr. Beefy Silver Brief KING Junk Man.""I've always felt a part of me is infused within the bricks of that place.

It looks like some sort of construction project gone wrong.I recently saw Brooklyn Bridge Falls at night though--and it changed my mind about your falls project.

More fancy drinks in Brooklyn, please!Enter Julie Reiner, mastermind behind Manhattan's cocktail haven Flatiron Lounge. Now, if you're expecting the low-key speakeasy scene you'll be disappointed with Clover Club--no secret numbers, no unmarked doors. But what she has done is create a larger-scale bustling neighborhood brasserie/pub scene that happens to serve top-notch cocktails and perfect bar snacks.Tonight was opening night, and CC was busy, but not annoyingly so. I got a seat at the bar while I waited for J, and had the signature Clover Club cocktail--gin, lemon and raspberry syrup. A little sweet, but tasty and super-frothy, just how I like it. The main space is lovely--hanging lanterns, tile mosaic and hardwood floors, textured wall paper and high pressed-tin ceilings. Unfortunately, when J arrived, we were squeezed in at what was most likely the worst table in the bar, a tiny two-top between two other tiny two-tops near the front of the room. It was loud and cramped, and definitely dampened our experience.However, the drinks and food were fantastic. J had the Black Mamba, a rye-based drink with a distinct herbal taste to it, and I had the Slope--also rye, but much more in the traditional Manhattan vein, and garnished with a brandied cherry, my favorite! I was also famished (and more than a little tipsy after my first drink), so I ordered the deviled eggs from the small but quality food menu. Excuse me, I need a minute.I can't even talk about how fucking good the deviled eggs were, I think my heart might break. Four beauties on the half-shell, each topped with an exquisite garnish--bacon, truffles, yowsers. I hit. The jackpot.

I give this place credit for trying though- fresh, high quality ingredients (including bufala mozzarella), excellent service, and it's kind of cool to get all your pizzas connected in one giant oblong pie when you order more than one pizza. The decor is pretty good too. The garage doors in front open up when the weather is warm so you can dine outside (or inside but feel like you're outside). The one drawback to that is the noise coming from Allen St. because it's a bus route. My conversation went something like this:Friend: So tell me more about this new girl you're dating. Me: Oh, she's great. She's really funny and we crack each other up. Her name is VVRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMM.Friend: Damn that bus is loud. I barely heard you. How did you guys meet?Me: Oh, we met VVRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMM, which is kind of funny since it's not someplace you would expect to meet someone.Friend: That's cool. How long before you nailed her?Me: Oh, we did it by the VVRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM date, which is a record for me.***Friend: How many f*cking buses roll down this street anyway? It's like 10 at night.

1596,51,59,4.0,"Until recently, my auction experience beyond eBay was limited to watching bags of worthless electronic goods being palmed off to unsuspecting Londoners in Covent Garden, for little more than a quid and tuppence, in the familiar ""going-going-gone"" setting. I was therefore quite excited about going to Sotheby's for a live auction, with two fellow NYelpers -- Ahu S. and Nami Z. Picture the village bumpkin that is me, sandwiched between two well-attired socialites.Auctions are a curious mix of theater and game theory, making them equally interesting to casual observers as well as active participants. Whether you are bidding on a Dutch painting in an English auction or an English painting in a Dutch auction, there are some basics that you should master before registering for an all-powerful paddle that signals both your willingness to buy and your ability to pay. For one thing, bids could come from a variety of sources -- absentees, phone callers, or even that poker-faced guy in Lee dungarees, sitting right next to you, playing with his disheveled hair. You never know. Our auctioneer was English, and mechanically went about showcasing lot after lot, having them knocked down at well above their reserve prices, each time issuing a fair warning before bringing down the gavel in a final blow to the losing bidders. Be prepared to pay a buyer's premium of as much as 25% over the hammer price. Better still, run the numbers ahead of time, based on the auction estimates from the catalog. And before you leave for the event, pop in whatever it is from your medicine cabinet that would keep your emotions in check, since payment is expected right after the auction ends, and pleading that your check will be in the mail will not pass muster.When you visit Sotheby's for an auction, leave some time to check out their public exhibition of other items, typically open a week in advance of their live auction. And feel free to ask the specialists on hand any searching questions you might have. In summary, you have nothing to lose. Go experience the vicarious thrill of a live auction at Sotheby's. Nothing compares, except perhaps Christie's.                         Nami Z.      Srini V.

1598,26,34,4.0,"Even from the outside with the large cotton candy machine and tanuki (traveling badger) statue with red blinking eyes, Kenka is a great place with a wicked sense of humor.Most recently, I took some San Diegans here to end a very drunken night. Though I usually go to Yakitori Taisho (best food on the street) or Village Yokocho (great food, great atmosphere), I decided on Kenka figuring it was the best place on the street to fit a large group. Kenka may not have the best food, but it has a sort of attitude that I adore. The place doesn't look terribly impressive at first; it has dingy fluorescent lighting (retro stained-glass boxy lamps hang recklessly from the ceiling), dirty white walls (with a simple landscape ""mural"" in the back), and slightly rickety and uncomfortable (tables and chairs are too low; chairs are made of straw that poke and itch) furniture. But it kind of works--if there was a concept of a Japanese dive during the 1960s, I'm sure it'd look something a bit like this. And then there are the quirks. Boobie filled yakuza movie posters hang on the walls. Old pinball machines are found in the back. Right above them are portraits of (presumably) actors and actresses of the 1960s rocking their fabulous hair. I even love the little smoking section outside which is outfitted with a model of a outdoors food stand; I quit long ago, but I totally wouldn't mind making an ass out of myself with a candy cigarette blowing puffs of sugar as I fantasize myself being in Japan. So the entire group of us ordered great amounts of food and alcohol--all very cheap. A pitcher of beer was about $8. Calpico cocktails (including peach flavor!) are $5.50 and come in lowball glasses. The cheapest bottle of sake (in terms of price for quantity) is a 1.5 liter monster for about $35. We got a bunch of things for the table of eight, and everyone left drunk and full for about $12 worth. I am always a bit disappointed by the food. The okonomiyaki is too soggy and oversauced. I'm also a little miffed that they use some sort of pita bread for the bottom instead of making it with the batter. The beef bowl lacked flavor, but came in a pretty good size. The wasabi squid could have been fresher (though the wasabi part was excellent). But the best was definitely the ramyun--the broth had just enough flavor and kick. But as I said, I'm in love with this place's attitude. So here goes the story. We're well inebriated when the waiter comes around telling us it's last call for food. We flip through the menu (even that has attitude with its scandalous front featuring the nude back of a slim female decked out in yakuza tattoos and a schizophrenic layout inside) and see that bull penis being offered. Being the immature drunkards that we were, we all burst into fits of laughter and dared another to eat it. We were all ganging up on one particular boy (he, of course, refusing vehemently), and I, being the drunk mess (and also thinking that there's no way he was going to take me seriously), told him I'd make out with him if he ate it. And before I knew it, I was apparently signing a contract on a napkin and my friend was hailing down the waiter. I love the waiters here. They might not be the friendliest, but they got a sense of humor. Friend: Um... could you tell me about the bull penis?Waiter: (dead serious) It's bull penis. Friend: (hoping the answer would be yes) Oh. Um... is the kitchen closed? Is it too late to order? Waiter: (dead serious) For bull penis, I will open kitchen. (at this point, the friend loses all color in his face)So he gets it. Bull penis is apparently served after it's been cleaned out, sliced, and preserved in (according to friend) sake with Japanese mustard poured on top. It looks disgusting. And he eats it. And takes 45 minutes to do so (the staff was kind enough to let us stay long enough to fully enjoy the torture show). When asked what bull penis tastes like, he answered, ""IT TASTES LIKE BULL PENIS."" (I'm sorry my friend isn't of much help) When further pressed, he explained that it was the most gross thing he's ever eaten, and more than the taste (mostly sake, he said) was the texture--both grainy and slimy at the same time. (Ew)Great place. Just a great place to laugh and drink away on a budget. P.S. And if you were wondering, I did not make out with him. Is it because he was too miserable afterwards? Is it because I'm an awful person? Is it because there's no way I was going to make out with someone who has bull penis breath? Probably all of the above, but mostly the last one.",21,0.9949

Cool restaurants, shopping, and nightlife is all nearby. The hotel entrance is whimsical, you enter through a white cavern at ground level where you'll find the hotel restaurant and bar (Thor). The desk staff was very responsive (I had to get an important fax out late night and the front desk guy helped me get it done).The room I stayed in (rate: $495 before tax) felt far more spacious than my past NYC experiences. I really liked how the window shade could be drawn or closed with the touch of a button. Maintenance of the hotel seems to be the one area of weakness. I had a suspicious stain my carpet (which they promptly cleaned) and my shower window had a crack.

After a long day of anticipation and reading the online menu out loud to everyone who calls to wish me a happy birthday, we finally meet up for a drink at the bar 45 minutes before our 9:30 reservation. The house cocktails we try are only OK--not very interesting tasting, really. I wouldn't bother.We're shown to our table in the back room and order a bottle of wine, which our waitress is very helpful in selecting. J excuses himself to go to the WC, so I take a look around. It really is just gorgeous in here--candles, exposed brick, antique bottles, curtains, and OH MY FREAKING GOD IS THAT GEORGE CLOONEY????!!!It is, it really is!! Like, at the table right next to us. I can't breathe. Normally I'm not such a starf&#%er, but come on! GC!!!J comes back to the table, and I try to control my irregular breathing patterns and concentrate on the menu, which looks delicious. The only problem is that I can see something else that looks delicious just over J's left shoulder, and I'm a little distracted. OK, focus. I order the scallops app, and J, being a newfound non-vegetarian, gets the foie gras. The scallops are, in a nutshell, mind-melting. Perfectly seared, buttery, and swimming in some sort of bacon-y maple-y dressing. Absolutely out of this world. The foie gras is rich and tasty, but compared to the  scallops, no real cause for celebration. Our entrees--salmon for me and lamb chop for J--are solid (though the lamb is a little on the fatty side), and oh hey George is having dessert!! I wonder if he's having the whiskey milkshake, like I'm thinking of having! Then it's like we're, you know, CONNECTED. Clooney and friends (who, P.S., include Cindy Crawford and husband) leave just before our dessert comes, so J finally gets my undivided attention. The only problem now is, how do I distract him so that I can eat all of the oatmeal ice cream that comes with the sweet cream french toast? J, thank you so much for an amazing birthday dinner.

Good.Does this place ACTUALLY deserve four stars? Maybe not, but I left MoSex having accomplished several things: I watched robot sex, saw interesting foreign objects used as sex toys, became intrigued with a sex couch that enables me to have acrobatic intercourse, I publicly watched porn (cat's out of the bag, guys) of many eras, I confess I left very aroused (I really recommend going with someone you're having sex with, you'll want to do it... ), but most importantly I actually felt uncomfortable at times. Me. Uncomfortable. About sex. Oh yea and I fondled and um... other things with a mock woman. THE SIGN TOLD ME TO DO IT. But those did not feel like breasts and her uh.. lady parts? No, that felt fake too. Regardless, there I was, in the middle of the museum, having my way with a lifesize imitation. With my friends watching me. I frequently found myself with my mouth agape, seeing things that I didn't expect to see. Their current exhibition is still Sex and the Moving Image which, as Stefanie M. said best, is porn over the years. The earliest porns didn't make it look like the woman was having all that much fun, but as the years went by the women seemed to get more... into it you could say. It got downright filthy at points.OH AND HOW COULD I FORGET?!If you haven't seen One Night in Paris or the Pam and Tommy Lee sex tape, HERE'S YOUR CHANCE.

I really enjoyed myself.Later that night.Edit: I completely forgot to add that during my fondling of said breasts, I attacked an innocent (male) bystander and made him confirm that boobs do NOT feel that way.

My first attempt at going to this bar involved me getting out of a cab and walking to the door.

Don't judge me...I'm a caffeine addict!On my second trip, I made the effort to walk in the door.

I can verify that the space is large, and surprisingly airy.Under the stairs is a zen like rock garden, where on special nights, bartenders will serve beer bongs.

Cocktail service can be spotty, so I tend to like to hang out closer to the bar.This is also where the gay ski group (the ski bums) hang out for the mid week meet up. During one of these events 300 people will crowd the upstairs and discuss the next ski trip they are taking. The back bar, on the first floor is also closest to the unisex bathrooms, and where usually you can get drinks the fastest. While sitting there one night during happy hour (which I've noticed isn't that busy...and therefore not as happy), I was enjoying the conversation of the man next to me when the oddest thing happened.

1619,30,22,4.0,"""IF I live to write about this, I would now give the restaurant a 4 star rating!"" So, I observed to Steven V and Victoria H, after we were each offered a complimentary glass of wine - subsequent to complaining about the volume of the background music. The owner had come forward, offered his apologies for being unable to switch it off (he did turn it down, which was our request as opposed to shutting it off), and tried to temper our discontent by slowly pouring the wine to fully unleash its amazing aroma! I must confess that the red wine (Alberto Longo Nero di Troia Le Cruste Puglia 2005) was one of the very best Italian wines I've had in recent memory!To expand upon my fears, this had been my second complaint about the volume, after the initial one had merely registered a brief stare off. That this followed an earlier request for the provision of salt to fortify the Polenta (with meat sauce and porcini mushrooms), brought incredulous stares from my two sincere friends and well meaning dining companions who obviously know this borough and SOME of its colorful inhabitants much better than I do. ""You don't do that in Staten Island!"" Victoria admonished me (mostly in jest, I hope!); ""You don't know where they've been!"" Bolstered by the slightly chilled house red wine I laughed back, ""Well, they don't know where I'm from""... followed instantaneously by a request that my epitaph read ""Here lies a courageous man"", as I would like to be remembered - as opposed to ""foolhardy""!Ok, any colorful personality types (none to be found in this restaurant) jokes aside, I've thoroughly enjoyed my two trips to Enoteca Maria. My interest had long been piqued by the concept behind the place where six Italian grandmothers take turns in the kitchen so that every night restaurant patrons enjoy traditional home cooking from a different region of Italy! It thus pays to do research and look up the restaurant's website as to which grandmother is cooking the day of your visit, and what the menu will be like.Regardless of who is running the kitchen that day a visit to Enoteca Maria begins with a complimentary tray of antipasto, the contents of which change daily. The tray is accompanied by homemade focaccia. This past Sunday, dinner (2-6 pm) featured Porchetta, Pate Figato, Trippa Milanese, and Bocconcini Mozzarella. In an earlier weekday dinner (which I recommend over the prix fixe Sunday menu) I thoroughly enjoyed the roasted red peppers, eggplant, and the mushroom lasagna. While the Pasta with four cheeses (gorgonzola, parmigiana, fontina, and ricotta) was the highlight of the Sunday dinner, generally the pastas are all well executed. I've also enjoyed the pizzas, with the Sfincione highly recommended for those that like pizzas without cheese. The Enoteca Maria version of Sfincione is like a huge brick (a few inches high!) of focaccia topped with garlic, onions, tomatoes, and red peppers.The desserts include fresh fruit, biscotti, a pear and chocolate torte (Recommended), chocolate cake, and my personal favorite: a Nutella torte. This exquisite dessert displays layers of ladyfingers, nutella, sliced almonds, and whipped cream with cocoa dusting. While it reminds one of Tiramisu, the flavors accented are not coffee but hazelnut, and perhaps anise? Exceptional, capable of being shared by two, and essentially: a must have!Enoteca Maria should feature on the bookmarks of any self-respecting foodie looking to sample excellent regional Italian cuisine and wines. That it has not yet been stampeded by visitors from Manhattan can only be explained by the recalcitrance to travel outside the borough. Take the advice of such a man of ""inertiative"": it is well worth the ferry ride!",38,0.9928
1620,23,17,4.0,"Sing, Muse, of the epic hunger of our heroes. Three valiant ones from Morningside Heights braved the torturous journey across town through traffic and storm, finally reaching their destination in the Upper East Side where, on 3rd Avenue, in between 75th and 76th, egos were questioned, abilities tested, legends were made, and glory was attained. The battles was to take place at La Tour, an impregnable fortress of French cuisine, whose challenge of never ending bowls of mussels drew our courageous heroes to the call of greatness. Despite a humble front on the outside, La Tour proved to be an intimate cavern of a culinary experience complete with dim lighting, walls decorated with framed photographs and antique movie posters, and pretty boy waiters. Though it was an all you can eat, its quiet and rather elegant ambience warned our heroes that today's war was not like the Chinatown buffets, but must be fought with wine and class.The battle began swiftly. Our heroes called out their demands against the intimidating foe of never ending mussels and La Tour answered with great speed. To our heroes' beckon came the blue cheese bowl, the Dijon bowl, and the Provence bowl. Though the mussels were not as delicious as our heroes hoped, they were still fresh and still worthy opponents. The blue cheese bowl was the heaviest but also the most delicious of the group, hitting hard with its rich flavor and broth. The Dijon bowl also proved to be formidable, as its spices were distinct and complimentary to the mussels. The Provence proved to be a let down, as it was more like a warm salsa than French herbs. And alongside the bowls of mussels came a cup of fries, who tried to distract our heroes with its tasty and crispy goodness. As the night continued, the battles ensued. Though all the flavors available were consumed by the second round, our heroes continued, eating their new favorites. Though wine broth turned out to be a let down, the blue cheese remained a valiant adversary. But by the end of the third bowl, our sole female warrior succumbed to the ferociousness of the battle, and retreated to battling the fries. Though ashamed to have not kept up with her peers, she was soon joined after the fourth bowl by her friend. Only one hero was left, and he continued to pull apart the mussels while guzzling down Scotch. It truly was an epic night. Though our heroes could not match the legendary deeds of the 10-bowl man or the 9-bowl woman (so told by the gorgeous waiters), they left La Tour, happy to have vanquished hunger and to have gained glory-- all for under $100. So into the night they went to battle their next foe-- sobriety. (And yes, they won that one too)",20,0.9962

I've been here over 50 times because this is a big magic meeting place for magicians, intellectuals, puzzle masters, celebrities and toy designers. For instance, the inventor of ""Tickle Me Elmo"" was there! Geek out! I don't like puzzles, but after this toy fair, I sat there because I was sucked into the new puzzles of sexy and intruiguing:1) I opened a silver suitcase, inside, it smoked dry ice. Inside was a clear tube with wires, gadgets, and a silver ball bearing suspended in air. A red counter on one side began counting down the hours, minutes, seconds. It looked like a bomb. Holy crap--it was a bomb!I had to solve this bomb puzzle before the counter went down to zero. I had 8 hours. If I didn't solve it, it would actually melt inside the clear canister and self destruct. There is only one available now, and it goes for $500. Cool!2) solve a puzzle that was index card sized, it looked like a makeup compact with an Egyptian etching on the surface. In one move, I had to open it. The only clue I had was when the Pharoh's eyes glow red. Creepy. I have no idea how it works. 50 Euros--yikes!And then a cool puzzle:*Try to create a picture of Einstein using these slide boxes, but the pictures keep vanishing and appearing. Weird. Can't describe it in words very well.*Hold a dodecahedron in your hand, tilt your hand, suddenly, it turns into a polyhedron then a hexagon, then suddenly it turns into two cubes. All done by the way you view the angle of the toy. JESUS CHRIST!!!!!!""

1625,28,54,4.0,"The title of this review should be ""How to Get Yourself Locked in a Restroom and Other Life Lessons I Learned at Max."" But before I begin, let me give you the bottom line: Would I recommend Max? Yes. It's a stellar date spot, the food (Italian) is good (though it's not going to change your life), and if it's not crowded on Valentine's Day (when I went), then I doubt it ever will be (this, my friends, gets bonus points in my book).The mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer my date and I ordered was delicious and perfectly share-able. The lobster ravioli had plenty of kick (which I like). We also split the tiramisu, which, sadly, was more cream than real substance. But our neighbors' gnocchi looked tasty enough to steal. The dinner? Fine. Go. The lessons? Learned. Here you go:Lesson #1: Max is the perfect solution to the ol' ""I-have-a-date-so-where-should-we-have-dinner?"" dilemma.My Valentine's date started off on all the right notes. I got a pre-dinner haircut. I was feelin' good. I liked the looks of my companion, and we agreed to go to Max, thinking the Tribeca location would be just out-of-the-way enough to still have a table or two open. Right we were! We walked in the door and were seated immediately. The space? Small and cozy and candlelit, and I'm telling you -- Love was in the air. Lesson #2: Bad things happen to vain people.We sat down, and I promptly excused myself under the guise of needing to wash my hands (I actually wanted to admire my new look for a couple of seconds). The hair looked good! The night would be good! It was all good! And then I tried to open the door (my date was waiting for me, after all). The door? Stuck. As stuck as a door can possibly be.Lesson #3: The employees at Max know Italian food. They do NOT know anything about construction and/or door destruction.What ensued was a comedy of errors. It took ten minutes for everyone (employees, fellow diners, and, of course, my date) to confirm that yes, the door was indeed stuck. Brute force couldn't get it open. Tools? A screwdriver, perhaps? Max keeps all of those handy instruments IN the bathroom closet. A butter knife was slid under the door. I, woman of zero handyman skills, tried to figure out how to drill myself out. Lesson #4: Freedom is a beautiful thing.It was an all-night low: Tools were littered all over the floor, I was slapping at the doorknob with a butter knife, and every once in a while I could hear my date whisper ""Krissy?"" into the door. Minutes (days? years?) later, the waiters teamed up and pulled and pulled and yelled and pulled, and managed -- miraculously -- to pull the door until they broke the broken lock open. Freedom! Oh, freedom. People cheered.Lesson #5: Embarrassment is a small price to pay for a very good, four-star dinner on the house.We were ushered (again) to our table. A waiter nervously handed me a rose. Two glasses of prosecco appeared. Another waiter nervously handed me another rose. My date and I looked at each other and started laughing. We laughed for the next two hours (progressively louder, I'm afraid, as we drank more and more of that very good prosecco).Will you like Max as much as I did? Probably. Will the waiters treat you as well as they treated me? Hopefully, they won't have reason to.The real question, though: Will you use Max's restroom? It's your call, my friends. It's your call.",24,0.9967
1626,26,21,4.0,"They say, in Greece, that if you leave the last bite of your food, you'll end up poor. Currently unemployed, I take my Greek sayings seriously. Thus, I choose my dining destinations wisely. Monstrous whopper or a little White Castle slider? China Greasy Buffet or small box of take out? When life is on the line, there is no space for gluttony and its risks.But when I found myself at Banjara the other night, I forgot to wonder about the portions. Blinded by the beautiful decor of the room, my mind shut down upon walking in. Dim lit and draped in intricate, sparkling Indian designs, the setting suddenly transformed into an Indian palace. Of course, I have no clue what an Indian palace really looks like, but in my own frilly imagination, it's something like this. So, like an Indian princess, I was ready to eat, the goal of finishing everything staying in the very, very back of my mind. It wasn't hard to choose dishes, as my dining companion--whom I will call King in order to complete my Indian palace/feast fantasy--was far more knowledgeable of Indian culture and cuisine than I am. The first royalty to touch my lips was the complimentary Pappadum, a thin wafer. As I munched curiously, King told me a little story about it, which I will recite to you here, simply to enrich your next visit to Banjara: Apparently, in Indian arranged marriages, a Pappadum cook-off was the mother's way of measuring the worth of her boy's potential wives. The candidates would be asked to cook it--a tricky task, because it is so thin and can easily be burned or undercooked--and the results were far more telling of personality than her cooking skills: Burning was a symbol of a woman's impatience and undercooking meant she was too soft and compliant with anything. Either trait was bad for the mother's precious little boy. As I munched on the wafer and listened to the story, I felt thankful for being born at the right place at the right time and having the freedom to make my own choices. Because although I do make a killer spinach pie, I am clumsier than an unmarried Indian girl munching on burned Pappadum. Next on the menu was the Poori Bhaji, a flavorful concoction with fried chickpeas, served with poori bread. The bread looked big and fat, and suddenly reality hit and I remembered that I was no grand Indian princess, but a small Greek girl in a big city, jobless and with the sole task of eating everything. The bread was going to be a challenge, but to my relief, it turned out to be hollow. Phew. The first entree placed before us was the Lal Maas--spicy lamb with fresh coriander, red chilies, peppercorn, and browned onions. Although I love spicy food, I was hesitant, knowing that the Greek's idea of spicy, which reaches as far as lemon chicken and sweet pastitsio, differs from the Indian's. But, to my surprise and perhaps disappointment, the lamb barely tickled my throat instead of ripping through my sinuses. Yet it was bursting with flavor and I found myself unable to stop eating, slapping King on the wrist every time he tried to take any, leaving him to drink his water, chew on flatbread, and watch me gorge myself on the luxurious lamb. Before I could finish the last piece, the second entree reached our happy feast. The Chicken Dumpakht, chicken cooked in a vessel sealed with bread, was, surprisingly not a firm pie as I had expected, but a soft bread sealing a soupy mixture involving chicken. But any thought of texture dissolved as deliciously as the dumpakht did once it reached my palate. There was so much food left by the end of our feast, but King and I were happy and full. King was surprised to hear me ask about dessert (he doesn't know that dainty Indian princesses and jobless Greek girls eat like horses, too), just as surprise as I was that I was throwing away my future so carelessly.Really, there was no room for dessert. But there was plenty of curiosity. So when Ras Malai, cottage cheese soaked in sweetened creamy milk, and Firni, a dessert resembling rice pudding, arrived, I was happy to extend my greek hospitality and make them feel at home. These tastes were unfamiliarly comforting. It's not very often that I enjoy sweetness outside the realm of chocolate, but then again it's also not very often that I find my highness in a splendid feast at an Indian palace with a majestic King.So, now you'll ask, did I finish those last bites of food or will I soon be checking out onto the homeless path in life?But, my friends, you ask too rashly. There are many more telling questions to consider here. Like, can you trick fate? Does taking the last bite home for lunch and dinner the next day count? If yes, then I guess I won't be poor any time soon. If not, well, lucky for me, I still won't be poor. Because as long as Banjara is around and people are generous enough to throw me scraps, my soul will always stay enriched.",22,0.9982

I wanted my 100th review to have a story behind it! You say I'm over-thinking this? Perhaps.It came to me today, while sitting on the train. DUH. I'd been meaning to review BWG since I joined Yelp, but something kept stopping me! It has to be my 100th review.My first trip to Blue Water Grill was a surprise date with my boyfriend many moons ago. It was a freezing cold night in January and he had made last minute reservations for the downstairs Jazz Room. We were seated immediately in front of the piano by the very friendly hostess and I took in the warm yet exciting ambience. I hadn't eaten in many NYC restaurants yet at this point, and I had high expectations.Thankfully, I wasn't let down. Our waiter was exceptional that evening! He was attentive and had such rhythm. I was highly impressed by his service (and that takes a LOT). The food that night was also top notch. First, we gorged ourselves on oysters that tasted so fresh they left us forgetting for the moment that we both had lobsters coming. I could barely eat my veggie side dishes by the time I was done with the lobster, though what I did taste was very good. By the end of our entrees we were totally spent........but we still dared to order dessert, of course! I don't know how I managed to cram another morsel into my mouth, but the bittersweet chocolate garnished with raspberries that arrived on my plate tempted the fate of my digestive system into overload. To top off a perfect evening and meal, the oh-so-kind waiter brought us complimentary champagne with dessert. :)Since that fabulous experience, we've returned twice. Once for our anniversary, and another for Valentine's Day (NOTE: the Valentine's Day Dessert Tray was the most OUT OF THIS WORLD sweetness I've ever eaten! Passion fruit everything=so good!!!!) When we do eat there now, we are a bit smarter with ordering and we always eat in the main dining room and request a ""quiet table.""We consider it a special occasion sort of place, as it is a smidgen over-priced and over-hyped (read: even with a reservation, you'll wait) ...and there ARE tons of other restaurants in the city where you get more bang for your buck.

1629,31,18,4.0,"HOLY HOT DAMN! What a meal, what a meal! Westville is yet another example of how much Yelp has changed my life when it comes to choosing restaurants. It was dinner time and I happened to be in Greenwich Village with my bf. Where to eat? ""Well, I've got my laptop. Do you want to check Yelp?"" he asks. Well, duh!When I saw that Sam P. and Russ W. (the new Yelp superpower duo) gave Westville glowing reviews, then I knew it had to be good eats. We walked up and literally got there an inch before another couple, so we scored the only empty table for two. Sucks to be them, I guess!The menu was really unique with its Market section. More than a few sounded pretty enticing (artichokes with parmesan? mmm), but we knew we had to save room for the mac & cheese. And the grilled corn on the cob w/lime, cortija cheese and cumin sounded too enticing for me to pass up. I ordered the burger w/salad and my bf ordered two Niman Ranch Fearless Franks w/mozzarella, tomato & basil salad.After we placed our order, I asked the waittress if there was a bathroom since the place was so tiny. She cheerily said, ""Yup! Just in the back, through the kitchen!"" So I ventured back there and saw that the kitchen area was even smaller than the dining area. There were no less than 4 people at the counter and about 6 guys in the kitchen that was only a little wider than my own kitchen. I saw a saute pan of fat, juicy, seared sea scallops on one of the burners and wished I had ordered that, too. A chorus of ""Coming through!"" surrounded me as I made my way to the bathroom. I think Westville's kitchen redefines the notion of a ""tight squeeze.""While we waited for our food, we had a bit of time to ruminate on the details of Westville. Yes, it is quite tiny and probably only seats about 24 patrons at capacity. But the funny thing was that there were SO MANY people in the back & kitchen! We counted about 16 people! And considering there only 22 customers, it was almost a 1-to-1 ratio. We were trying to figure out who all these people are & what they do. It seemed a bit excessive until we realized that they do a lot of delivery service b/c a few guys kept leaving the kitchen with big bags of food. People probably figure they have a better chance at eating a Westville meal if they just have it delivered. And I don't blame them.The corn came out first and it was a sign of great food to come. The waitress thoughtfully brought us extra napkins, which we immediately needed. The sauce dripped down my chin as I bit into the corn and I couldn't get enough. My bf announced that he thought it was better than the corn at Cafe Colonial.Next up came the big steaming bowl of mac & cheese. When we wavered on whether to order it with bacon or not, the waittress grinned and said, ""Order it with bacon. Trust me."" That's one trustworthy waitress! Now, I'm not a Southern girl and I didn't grow up eating mac & cheese (at least not out of a box), so I can't say that I'm some kind of mac & cheese connoisseur. But HOLY HOT DAMN, that was one frikkin' excellent bowl of mac & cheese! And my bf, who did grow up in the South, exclaimed ""That's hardcore incredible!"" Gooey & melty & flavorful & hot & so yum yum yum! Not to mention the substantial pieces (no, not bits!) of bacon thrown in there. Wow. I could eat that mac & cheese for days. Our main course came, and I had a sense that we were in trouble. The hotdogs were HUGE. Probably three times the width of a Gray's Papaya dog. The melted cheese and sweet relish was sitting atop the dogs, looking ever so enticing. I suggested that we split the dogs and burger so we could both have a taste. I think I could have eaten just one of those dogs and been completey full. I managed to get through half the burger before my stomach pleaded ""No more!"" The burger was pretty good, but a bit overshadowed by the rest of the meal. The salad dressing, a slightly creamy vinaigrette, was pretty tasty - I had trouble identifying the flavor components and in my food stupor, I forgot to ask the waitress.There was absolutely no room for dessert, but the waitress convinced us to get a cookie to go, so we did. This was one incredible dining experience, topped off with friendly, attentive, helpful & excellent service. Now why only 4 stars? Because my stomach is not as resilient as I wished it were. I'm slightly lactose intolerant and my tummy was rebelling against me. The mac & cheese, for me at least, was a little too good to be true. I think it did me in. Oh how I wish my stomach could perform gastronomic acrobatics, but alas, no! Let's just say I had a very productive bathroom session later that night. And so did my bf, whose stomach *can* perform gastronomic acrobatics. Oh well, my motto with food has always been, ""Eat now, pay later."" And that's just what I'll continue to do at Westville.",29,0.9983

1633,39,55,4.0,"HOW TO TALK LIKE AN ITALIAN WHO LIVES IN STATEN ISLAND1. Pronouncitation of Words:The first thing you might want to do is get the pronunciation of some words. In a New York accent, the ""r"" at the end of a word is almost never pronounced. The ""g"" at the end of a word isn't pronounced either. So ""going"" is pronounced ""goin'"" and ""here"" sounds like ""hea"". The ""th"" sound sounds something between ""d"" and ""th"", but if you're unsure, speak with the ""d"" sound.2. Vowels:Many of the words that have the ""o"" sound (like in coffee) are pronounced with an ""aw"" sound, so the word dog, for example, would sound like ""dawg"", as well as ""coffee"". 3. The accent is like a deep sounding voice, and words are spoken kind of in a relaxed way. Since New York was at one point very Italian, Staten Island in particular, people of Italian descent that live in the areas tend to have a little bit of Italian accent mixed in.

The bi-annual Theory sample sale is the most dangerous time of the year for my credit card - seriously, I sort of black out, then $500 later I'm not really sure how I acquired this gorgeous wine colored cashmere hoodie, or that amazing grey/green poplin blazer. However, I can keep control in the store (or in the many department stores where it's sold) because I think it's more than bit overpriced, and I just won't pay retail for it. This is their largest retail outlet, but I echo Timothy B that I'd like to see more interesting bits of the collection here at their flagship.

However, NYC is the major leagues, and it'll be interesting to see how Five Guys performs alongside Burger Joint, Shake Shack, Corner Bistro, Brgr, etc. Whereas a Burger Joint burger may be that hipster girl who lives in Midtown and wears designer skinny jeans (with some rips to look cool), a Five Guys burger is like the sorority girl from college who wears tank-top and 501 jeans and you just can't get enough of her.Five Guys doesn't skimp on their burgers and if you order a regular burger, be ready for a baseball-sized patty of beef. If you're not looking for a coma to follow your lunch, order the little burger instead. Also be prepared for a mess, as their burgers are like the ones your uncle used to grill at a summer picnic.

Land of muscle men, tank tops, and washboard abs (I knew I should have worked out yesterday).We walked down 8th ave, and I spotted this place. Something was different. Empty tables, most people dressed appropriately, no muscles bulging...My God? Why is the restaurant have so few people? We decided to give it a try.Entering the restaurant, our hostess sat us at a table right next to the window. Why? Because this is Chelsea...it's all about watching the eye candy walk by.It was at this point, when I opened my menu, I realized why no self respecting circuit boy had walked into this restaurant. Carbs. They are the enemy and they had declared full war in this place! Every item is a garlic infused carbohydrate packed delight.I looked at my waist, and since my pants were feeling a bit on the loose side, I figured I could handle it...as long as I did it in moderation. Bring on the feast!Our waiter, a cute guy I honestly think I may have dated in the past (so many men...so little that are memorable), recommended the Four Cheese Lasagna with a pink sauce. Pink sauce? Could I be any more gay?...I'll take it. My friend ordered the Chicken Marsala, which comes with of side of guess what? Pasta! Bring on the carbs! Neither of us will be having boyfriends tonight!Our buss boy brought us 8 pieces of garlic bread. Eight? Are you serious? Do you have any idea how many hours on the treadmill I'm going to need to spend to work off these 6 (mmmm...good) pieces of bread? Just one of these 4 pieces has to be at least 300 calories! (swallow)...they should warn you before they bring 2 pieces of bread to the table! What? Yes, please refill our bread basket.My pants were beginning to feel tight, so I thought it best to loosen my belt.Thankfully, as we were finishing our second basket of bread, the lasagna came out. Now for those of you who don't know this, it's time I set the record straight. Ladies and gentlemen:Size matters.Specifically when it comes to lasagna, and the Gorgonzola, ricotta, Parmesan and mozzarella goodness that I was about to eat showed just what kind of size queen I can be.  This lasagna was larger than two of my fists put together. There was no way possible I was going to eat all of that....but damn it...I was going to try!Somehow I had transformed into a pig (read=pig...not PIGGY!) and this lasagna dish was my trough. My friend, seeing my dinner, tried to take a fork full taste for himself. He nearly lost an hand in the process.""MINE"", I growled, as I continued to shovel into my mouth the cheesy bubbly goodness that I am going to be working off in the gym for months. My fellow gay brethren stared from outside, as I shed all sense of decorum and ate...and ate...and ate.""Don't judge me!"" I thought. I would have said it, but that would have meant pausing in my eating, and stopping was not an option. This was the best damn lasagna I'd had in 5 years (granted, it's also the only lasagna I've had in 5 years). Sadly, I had to stop, as if I ate any more food, I would have been sick. Not to mention, I think I split the back of my pants open.Thankfully our waiter wrapped up the remaining 2/3, which I will be able to eat for breakfast...and lunch, and dinner today. It was that much food!Now some of you (well any of you who've actually read this far down) may be wondering why I only rated this restaurant 4 stars. Well, you see, I had dinner last night at 8:00 pm. It is now 12:30 the next day. I've brushed my teeth twice, flossed, had several cups of coffee and some sugarless gum.

(yanked from the half-priced menu) - $1, $1.50 or $2.50!- Spicy Crunchy Tuna or Yellowtail roll- Unagi/eel roll- Sabagari: Mackerel roll w/ scallion & ginger- Ikura sushi- Tobiko sushi- plum paste w/ japanese yam (disclaimer: i think this is on1/2-priced)where else in the area can you can cram 12 pieces of ikura in your mouth for 12 bucks?!  there are also other tasty appetizers (i highly recommend taking a few min. to peruse their menu for appetizers...the menu's decently-sized).  7 OR MORE PEOPLE: you can get a room & get tanked on sake. there are 2 sit-down style tables.  the only drawback is it takes 5 or 10 minutes for that guy in your party to stop blurting out ""hey, we're eating JAPANESE STYLE!  we're eating JAPANESE STYLE!"" after everyone's already taken their shoes off.what a maroon.  who invited that guy?  what is it - the first time he's eaten sushi or something?  he's the same guy that will scream ""DO-MO-AREYYY-GATT-OO"" on the way out as the owners wave back thinking ""sucker...we already have your money moron...now get the hell out.""anyway, the service is great, cool peeps in the place...and the downstairs is unexpected & exotic (when they don't rope it off like the germans -- ""verboten! this exhibit is CLOSED!"")sake is also on the 1/2-priced menu but is a bit pricey to help pad that bill.  i referred to Typhoon's sake in my kurasushi review, where i mentioned your entire party could probably dine at kura for the price of sake at Typhoon. But even the Typhoon house sake is delicious & well worth it ($20).HOLY FRIED CALAMARI ROLL!  i just saw chris rock on the Lifetime channel! It's the one about the pimps /prostitutes in case you missed it (the gf's watching it in the background as I write my Typhoon opus).  Of course it was filmed early 80's so he played a pimp and I think just got arrested. Boy I bet that director's patting himself on the back now - ""I'm glad I chose the best role for him and really tapped into his full potential."" That director is an IDIOT (said jon heder-style) - Chris is one of the funniest.  Anyway, I bet that director would eat at Typhoon Fri or Sat - not a good move so don't unless you're out, drunk and hungry - be like Chris Rock, be cool & eat at typhoon Mon-Thurs. -- that's when you get a 4-star and a good deal.Peace out.",14,0.9859
1648,29,28,4.0,"I have always been fascinated by memory. Selective retention and recall never cease to amaze me. I continue to marvel at the fact that even after spending 4+ years studying science, my sister may not be able to recall much more than the chemical formula for water, but will be able to identify with utmost clarity and precision the color, design, cut, fabric and texture of a dress worn in July 1987 by a neighbor's niece visiting from out of town and attending a birthday party for another neighbor!Same goes for Ahmed, the friendly co-proprietor of the Halal Food Cart (HFC). I have gone to his cart for months, fortunate that MOMA and HFC are both only a few hundred yards from work. There was even a stretch of 4 weeks, where I was there EVERY single day for lunch (I know, I am like that!). The only change in my order was to substitute 'Chicken over Pita' with 'Combo over Rice'. The routine was sooo predictable:Ahmed: Yes boss, what will you have?Me: Chicken over Pita (or Combo over Rice)Ahmed: Hot sauce? White sauce? (they also have BBQ sauce)Me: Only hot sauceAhmed (joking): Hot guy, huh?Me: Hah!Ahmed: Any drinks with that?Me: No, thanks.Ahmed (after a couple of minutes): Here you go, boss?Me: (I simply hand him the money, knowing the cost by now) Enjoy your day!Every single working day for a whole month! (Even the joke!)Obviously, after a while I decide to explore other options (I know, I give a lot of thought to lunch!) - and switch over to House of Pita for a falafel sandwich...So, when I visit HFC after a month or so (talk about behavioral patterns), Ahmed doesn't recollect who I am. As I am about to pay, I see a bulb flash in his eyes. While counting the money, he turns around and says: Long time, boss?Me: Yes. You remembered! Even though you have thousands of customers!Ahmed: How could I forget you? Remember the girl with the glasses?Me: Yes (on one of those 20 occasions, he had tried to flirt with a (hot) girl standing ahead of me)Ahmed: See, I remember everything.Me: I can see that! I came here every single day for a whole month. With the same order. You didn't remember ""only hot sauce"", but you remembered the hot girl standing in front of me! Once!We both laugh.So, yes. Memory is a funny thing. HFC (see I am subtly conditioning you'll to remember this name, over KFC!) is one of the best value for money meals you can find in the city. $5 goes a long way. But, don't go expecting a gourmet meal, it is street food, after all. You will however find: good food (juicy meat), entertainment and the opportunity to make friends while waiting in line (which often runs 20 deep at midnight - for the evening shift!).Such is HFC's reputation by now (""It has its own website!"") that all sorts of people walk up to stand in line. On a good day you will hear a ""clueless foodie"" (obviously a transplant from the land of the golden gate) joke about the name to a friend. ""Dude, what does 'Halal' mean?"" Friend: ""Don't know, must be a take on hola... or something like that?"" yeah, yeah....have some ice cream.[Written to re-assure Scott R., knowledgeable foodie and author of ~300 discerning reviews covering extremely diverse cuisines - from hamburgers to international, that I can yelp beyond dessert - well, occasionally :-)) ]Update (06/29): Scott was also quick to remind me (fittingly for a memory themed review) that I had written up the 'B-team'. That is a fact. In a further twist to the already thrilling saga of the food cart at 53rd and 6th, not too many are aware that a separate team (""The Real 53rd and 6th"") functions after 7:30 pm. They are now distinctively dressed in yellow T-shirts that say (among other things): We are Different. The evening shift is mechanically more efficient, and perhaps the ""real deal"" to their legions of intoxicated devotees, but I actually like the afternoon shift for the lamb (more well done) and the character of the personalities. In any case, I think that there is little to separate any of the Halal food carts that abound nearby. However, I do concede that the evening shift is absolutely unmatched in one thing - You guessed it: the white sauce! (Re: their hot sauce, as Julie K notes, it needs an accompanying fire hose. My advice to unsuspecting newbies: skip it)",26,0.9981

You seemed cute and you were alone, so I figured ""what the hell""!Our conversation seemed to flow well, and I did learn that you were an architect that just moved here. That being said, I should tell you that I didn't have any food that day. In fact my meal had consisted so far of three very large margaritas. Therefore, I'd like to say I remember your name, or anything else we may have discussed, but to be honest...not a thing is coming to my mind.

Hopefully the rest of your night was just as easy.Did we pay you?Sincerely,Patrick******Dear Upper West Side Neighbors,Those screams you heard last night were not someone getting mugged.

And let's face it: I was wearing a simple black t-shirt and my oldest pair of jeans.  I didn't feel like being snubbed on my unusual lack of fashionista-forwardness tonight.""C'mon! It'll be fun,"" he said and gave my shoulders a little squeeze (did I happen to mention that Mr. X had decided to put his arm around my shoulders? A slight detail that I forgot to mention earlier. My apologies.).I hate to say no to a party invitation--to any social invitation, really. Not only is it rude, but how can you resist when Mr. X is the one asking you and squeezing your shoulder? So I said yes.Not only does the Rose Bar end up being as exclusive as I've heard it to be, it is ridiculously exclusive. Upon going to the restroom, I am given a card by a doorman who tells me to hold on to it and to hand it back to him when I am done in order to re-enter the bar. What a funny game to play! In my sleepy and slightly tipsy state I was worried that it might fall into the toilet bowl and then what would I do? Would he let me back in? After all, I was only wearing a black t-shirt and old jeans. There was a man at the bar wearing red pants. I could never compete with red pants. At least not that night. In any case, even my excursion to the co-ed toilets turned into a social opportunity, as some man leaving decided to hit on me before I made it to my stall. When I came back Mr. X was waiting for me. And after the rest of the crowd had turned in for the night and left us alone on our couch, we got to talk about ourselves a bit more. He told me about salsa dancing and San Diego and a girl he had once dated. It didn't work out, he said. I told him about...I can't remember what I told him about really. But whatever I said, it must have been good because at one point Mr. X stopped talking to kiss me. And even though the Little Voice inside my head was telling me to pull away, I pressed the mute button and went with it anyway. For once, I was going to be in the moment. And a little kissing never hurt anyone. I think.At 3am, I knew I had to go home and get some sleep. I was going to be late again for another responsibility the next morning if I didn't get to bed soon. Less than 24hrs. had passed and already this Mr. X was going to be the cause of me being late twice. (""Not good,"" said the Little Voice. ""Shut up,"" I said, ""I'm having fun."")We were almost the last ones to leave and Mr. X wanted to hail me a cab. He graciously fought off the protests to pay my fare. ""So when are you coming out to California?"" he said. I laughed. And he didn't. And then he quickly said, with a smile, that he was kidding. And I realized that a part of him wasn't. I was surprised. But the Little Voice was happy. Like she had just gotten the best piece of chocolate and no one else had noticed kind of happy. I told him we could talk about it another time. A taxi had pulled over and was patiently waiting for me. I had to go. And so like a true salsa dancer, he took me in his arms for a dip and kissed me goodnight.

Seriously, it's hard to leave when there's food right in front of you, ready for the picking! When we first arrived, the place was pretty empty. We opted to sit at the bar surrounding the sushi chef island so we could be close to the action. Also, I didn't realize that the conveyor belt went around the *entire* restaurant, so we could just have easily grabbed stuff from a booth - oh well, good to know for future visits...and yes, there will be future visits!So one thing I noticed is that the sushi chefs start making the really interesting rolls around 6:30-7pm, when the place starts to fill up. Unfortunately, we filled up on some rolls that I later presumed were probably sitting there for awhile (probably from the late-lunch session). When I saw what I thought was an eel roll, I got excited but then wasn't certain it was an eel roll, so I let it go by (I didn't know if I was allowed to inspect a plate then put it back, so I thought it better not to touch unless I definitely wanted it). My friend was referring to the menu the whole time so we could tell which rolls were which (like a big sushi bible with pictures!), so she confirmed that it was an eel roll. It didn't look like any other eel rolls were being made, so I had to anxiously await the return of the eel roll, hoping against hope that no one else would take it. It finally made it's way all around the entire restaurant, through the kitchen....and back to me! This time, I grabbed it as soon as it was within arm's reach. Of course, I was really being silly b/c a few minutes after that, the chefs were putting new eel rolls on the belt left and right. Whatever, it was more fun for me to treat it like a game - a weird sushi race track game. And guess what, I won!I'm wondering how crowded this place gets during lunch*, b/c this would make for a very fun and easy work lunch treat. A nice little break from the work day doldrums, where I could imagine the salmon sushi battling it out with the eel rolls to make it to my mouth first. In the end, it doesn't really matter who gets there first - I'm always the winner in that game!----*Update: Just had a lovely work lunch here courtesy of my boyfriend. We went around 1:30 and it was still pretty full, but luckily two seats opened up at the sushi bar. We ate about $30 worth of sushi in 45 minutes and I was thoroughly satisfied. Niiiiiice.",17,0.9979

Joey wanted to drink red so we went ahead and ordered a bottle of Baron de Rothschild Cabernet, and after merry conversation and drinking, we were led to our tables.Here's where the pity starts. As soon as I opened the menu and peeked at the other patrons platters I realized what this place was or intended to be. This was a flagrant attempt to invent haute Mexican cuisine. The ingredients were familiar, as were certain names, but the platters were totally unknown; they had mixed, matched, created, and experimented in order to make artesanal ""chic food"" as Joey kept calling it, so that Mexican cuisine could shake a bit of it's dictatorial stigma...even me!! I kept thinking ""this is not REAL Mexican food"" - but why? Why can't someone valiantly experiment with ingredients to yield a 'lil bit of eclecticism to an ethnic cuisine? Why can't they take that guitar and smack the Mariachi? Why can't they twist the taco? Of course they can, granted, that is, if you are good at it. And it was.Appetizers: We had Fillet of Ostrich Tostadas with pinto beans, goat cheese and guava (I love guava) spicy glaze.... yummy!!!!Platters: I had the rack of lamb peppered with pistachio and mole sauce... the lamb was a 'lil scant, and the mole more sweet when I would have liked it more spicy, but the platter was great, and the lamb tasty. I liked Joey's platter more though; her three cheeses over chicken was aces...Service was prompt, charming, attentive; and to crown the experience, our waiter, Michael, came completely out of the blue and brought us a delicious 3 leches fig that was splendid; and only because we engaged in friendly conversation....

1662,24,14,4.0,"I've been sitting on several reviews for months, but I'm tripping over myself and also breaking my multiple-visit-before-review rule to post this.Apna Bazar Cash and Carry is an Indian grocery store located somewhat inconspicuously next to Subzi Mandi, another grocery store dominating the southeast corner of (I think) 73rd Street and 37th Ave. If you were walking along 73rd St and not paying attention you might think that Apna Bazar is just an extension of Subzi Mandi, but you'd be mistaken for one very important reason.Apna Bazar sells imported Indian mangoes. We got a box of ten Alphonso mangoes for $28. Dubya-tee-eff, you ask? Alphonsos are called the ""king of mangoes"" (with the possible exception of Pakistani mangoes, which I've not yet tried, but let's not go there). They are small but have a flavor and texture that surpasses anything you'll ever get from a Tommy Atkins mango. The Tommy Atkins, readily recognizable for its red blush, is available in US grocery stores for most of the year and is favored by grocers and farmers specifically for its high-fiber flesh, which holds up well to long distance shipping... to say nothing of taste. The Alphonso is one of the few fiberless mango varieties available in the world. It has an intense, floral sweetness with a hint of anise near the green part, it's soft as toro, juicy beyond belief, and has only the slightest hint of stringiness near the seed. Even then, it's more like peach fuzz than dental floss. All you people who gnaw mango seeds over the sink know what I'm talking about.When you go, and assuming they're not sold out, the mangoes will be at the counter immediately to your right as you walk in. It's assumed that you'll want to inspect the contents before taking it. Keep your keys handy in case the salesman encounters a particularly securely taped box.It's not really worth mentioning, but I'll say it anyway because it freaks people out. The mangoes are irradiated. I'm not concerned about it in this case because it's done to mitigate the threat of foreign fruit flies.Ultimately, many people will think that the price premium is not worth it. But I say, if you like mangoes, keep an open mind and buy a box. If you're really nervous, split the cost with some friends. You'll never look at other mangoes the same way again. These mangoes will ripen in a matter of days and will go bad in less than a week. Eat quickly... not that it will be a problem.6/21/07 updateI'm practically palpitating.

1665,18,17,4.0,"A few weeks back, I noted with some interest a spate of reviews on Indian sweets. That reminded me that I hadn't written up anything outside of the incomparable, Ras Malai. In the subsequent period I have been sampling various sweet shops in Manhattan and Queens. The one that deserves high praise for consistently excellent quality and value for money is: Sukhadia. For $8.99 a pound you can pick up an assortment of delicious sweets in one box. These are not the traditional Gulab Jamun variety, but almost any and everything is delectable. My favorite items here include Coconut Barfi, Mango Barfi, Cashew Roll (stuffed with pistachio), Kaju Katli, Almond Roll (pistachio filling), and Carrot Halwa (divine when heated slightly).The issue I have with most Indian sweet vendors is that their product is so rich that one can't possibly feel anything but heavy after consuming them. However, Sukhadia excels in the ability to get the serving size right and doesn't OD on sugar. This is a rare skill and merits them 'Best in Class' status.Despite my unstinted praise for their product, I am subtracting the fifth star for spotty service - more of an issue when the manager was away for a few months. Apparently, he had gone back to India to get married ... and as a result, smiles more often these days. He is very efficient and professional and I hate to frequent the shop whenever he isn't around. The replacement is often on the phone taking delivery orders (they also run a restaurant) as opposed to attending to you.Sukhadia has outlets in Chicago, New York, and Edison, NJ. I can't say for the original location in Chicago, but as I understand the New York outlet sells sweets made in the Edison Kitchen. Thus, the difference between having a good experience and a GREAT one is the ability to spot which is the fresher dessert - the one that has been brought into the city that same day. As the observational skill will take ordinary mortals some time (and a few hundred thousand calories!) to master, I would suggest opting for the selection that seems least disturbed by sales. Generally, I've noticed that the trays that are almost full, are the ones that are the freshest.Otherwise, I recommend a strategy that I've successfully used here: Look at the server in all earnestness and say that you have to buy a few boxes to take to a wedding. Lo and behold, smart businessmen that they are, they will search inside the closets to find you what is the very best of the goodies on display. The philosophy was once shared with me ""You are taking my product to a wedding. Everyone will want to know where you got the sweets from. I can not spoil my reputation by coming up short"" (and losing potential for significant orders subsequently as weddings/functions are the occasions where they sell the most - for every attendee HAS to partake in sweets).Going back to the observational skill, I often read with some amusement the gracious praise that comes my way at yelp for the passion I have for desserts. I thought I might share an interesting anecdote in this regard. When I was a toddler, my family was visiting a number of shrines of sufis and saints across Punjab in Pakistan. At one particular shrine of a saint who lived in the 12th Century (and was fond of sugar and all things sweet), one of the elder faqirs (Baba) who was sitting quietly (they don't talk for days on end), as if in a trance, got up all of a sudden and came towards my mother. ""Child"", he intoned, ""You will never lack sugar in your life"". He paused to hear the small crowd nearby chatter excitedly at the unexpected blessing of the Baba. Then continued: ""Nor will one of your children"". With that, he walked back to resume his meditation. I have absolutely no recollection of this event, but given that my Mom is the only one of her siblings to love dessert and I've had more than my share of them, I often wonder how much there is to life that one can not explain rationally!",20,0.9994

1670,23,22,4.0,"In the summer of 1998, spurred by the seemingly Herculean efforts of now-disgraced baseball god, Mark McGwire, I attempted to stymie the rapid, outward progression of my unattractive potbelly by procuring a starter supply of the synthetic hormone, Androstenidone, from a local GNC. The nearest GNC I knew of was in Carrol Gardens, so I jumped on the train and headed down to the proverbial beanstalk for the ""magic beans"" that I hoped would transform my wholly unimpressive, soft physique into something worthy of an Italian sculptor. My enthusiasm was quickly rebuffed by an attentive GNC employee who spotted me lingering near the locked glass case that housed my miracle pills. He warned me that andro was for professionals, and that improper use would result in the formation of abnormally large mammaries, better known in the world of juvenile, anatomical colloquialisms as ""Man Tits"". While I was not seeking to replicate the mutant, grotesque features of Mark McGwire, the media hype and revelation of the Cardinal slugger's andro use put me in the market for some slightly bigger guns. The knowledgeable salesperson at GNC put me right in my place. And it wouldn't be the last time...A year and change later, I again found myself in GNC seeking a ""revolutionary"" new supplement that was a mere virgin on the over the counter market. I cannot recall the exact name of the product, but it was some kind of vitamin water infused with synephrine and ephedra. The salesman who recited the precautions and side effects of this drink to me did so with such efficiency, I decided to void the purchase and terminate future attempts at acquiring the fountain of youth. In this case, drinking from the fountain was only slightly less a detriment to one's health than licking the floor of a crystal meth lab. So, why does GNC get the 4 star rating? Because I left with the feeling that they genuinely placed my personal safety above profit...on two separate occasions, no less. It's a rarity in the wellness industry, which often seems driven by financial gain through deceptive advertising, but that was not my experience with GNC. I enthusiastically recommend the Carrol Gardens store to anyone wishing to consult a knowledgeable workforce prior to making a nutrition supplement purchase.

I was even happier to find out that unlike some of the other shops that have vintage that is UNBELIEVABLY marked up your pieces are VERY reasonable!!

1673,11,17,4.0,"Maybe it's because I don't really go to hip & trendy bars to ""see and be seen"" that I was so impressed with this place. You really don't know what to expect when you're climbing the stairs from the elevator level (where the indoor lounge is). But when you first walk out onto the roofdeck, it's like ""Wow!""

Don't ruin it for the rest of us, punk!Now where was I? Oh yes, the views. Spectacular. I came here for a company party, so we had a corner section sanctioned off, which was great.

1675,13,2,4.0,"Lunch and dinner are evaluated separately below. Lunch offers the tried and true crowd-pleasers: a largesse of pulled pork and high quality ingredients. (The edamame are in pristine form!) The obvious choices are Korean burritos and steamed pork buns. The flour tortilla is perfectly hot, fresh, and elastic, as are the steamed buns. This alone distinguishes Momofuku from the offerings of the city's Mexican and Chinese restaurants. * Momofuku SsamA stupefying quantity of food! Tender, well-seasoned pork popping from the seams. The flavor combination may very well be fine as is. Don't make the mistake I did in asking for extra Ssam sauce. The dish is already pretty high in salt and sufficient in heat. (The Bibb Lettuce Ssam, which looks to be the same ingredients over rice, seems better suited to balance the salt.)* Berkshire Pork Steamed BunsSimilar in form to what you'd get with Chinese restaurants' Peking Duck. But here, the attention paid to freshness and to ingredients is commendable.* Hitachino White AleWeird fruity beer. (I was fascinated by the owl on the label.) Stick with OB (a refreshing Korean beer seltzer) or for a heavier brew, Anchor Steam. I left a half bottle undrunken (unprecedented!). Even if one prefers the fruitier beers, Hitachino White failed to complement the food. The ambience suffers because the setting is too swank for this humble lunch.

The fried leaves have a delectable crust. The salinity of the dressing should probably be cut with a little more lime and sugar, but the dish otherwise is perfect.* Tello's Chawan Mushi (with Snails and Black Truffle) A sublime egg custard cooked with a dashi stock with just a hint of the sea. Steep in price, but at the very least, an educational eating experience. Snails were perfectly cooked, with just enough bounce and give.* Grilled Rice Cakes Bait and switch! The ""rice cakes"" here are cylindrical segments of Dduk cut into 4cm segments. They are not ""grilled"" but rather casseroled in a spicy red bean sauce of crumbly pork meat. The dish is a sort of cross between Italian Bolognese and Korean Dduk Boki. Even with the clever addition of Thai basil, the casserole itself is nothing relevatory. Like a lot of things on David Chang's menus, the dish is super salty. A side bowl of rice might enhance one's enjoyment of this homey offering.Service is extremely companionable. When asked for recommendations, the multitalented hostess/waitress/busser waxed rhapsodic about the Brussels Sprouts. She then beckoned a couple other servers over, to have them also opine. Like the soundtrack being played, service is cute and peppy.As for the food ... there's a certain compulsion, myopia, or autistic imagination to David Chang's treatment of food. The flavor combinations of many of the dishes suffer from a sort of singular over-enthusiasm. But his excitement is palpable. He dares to throw -everything- into the mix. And when he touches upon something good, he makes dang sure you get plenty of it, in exquisite form. What makes this place interesting is that his thought process, his influences, and his experimentation are transparent. Come here expecting creativity but not refinement. He cooks the way a cute little brother with cool new toys would.  Though it's hard to separate the food from the ambience from this kind of transmission of excitement, here goes ...

1679,23,5,4.0,"Most shops in the Garment District are narrow and deep. Rolando's sits in the back of a Blimpie's and would be impossible to find save a neon sign in the window that reads ""SPANISH FOOD"" and a small menu taped up to the window. Ordering at the Blimpie's would be a tragedy, so follow the white ceramic wall tiles and heavenly smells to the back, where the real crowd and action lie.The white tile ends where the service counter begins, giving way to bare walls painted in a color that matches the yellow rice. The ceiling height drops by about half. In the summer, several fans push the hot air around. You won't catch the Metro Cafe crowd here. The best time to go is in the middle of lunch rush, between 12-1 PM. The turnover is fast, the line at its longest, and the food at its freshest. The line snakes around in a long, narrow U-shape, giving you time to peruse the items in at least twenty steam trays lined up in two rows, divided roughly into 12 trays of mains and another 8 for starters and sides.A sign on the back wall shows the prices: a ""small"" is $4.50 and a ""large"" is $6. The small and large containers are the same sizes you get at halal carts, which is to say that the small is the size of a styrofoam hamburger container and the large is about twice as wide but a little shorter. If you're on a tight budget, order a small and have your food to stay. They'll fill both halves of the container. Depending on your main, your portions may end up as a sort of ""medium.""If you haven't been to a place like this before, here's how it works. In the first half of the line you select a container size, your rice and your beans. The rice is white or yellow. The beans are usually red or black, though lentils make an occasional guest appearance. You can then pick extras like maduros for fifty cents per selection. Always visually inspect the maduros before ordering. Occasionally, the plantains are not fully ripened. They're still edible, just not as sweet and delicious. Your container is filled, closed, and passed on to the next section where another server will ask you to select your main.The flow of people and food will sometimes move unevenly and it's possible you'll be asked to pick a main before you can actually see them. You don't have to pick until you're in front of the steam trays, but identify selections that catch your eye while waiting on line to make the best use of your time. The people behind you are hungry, too!Your container is opened, the main is added, the lid is closed again and passed to the cashier. The cashier opens the lid so you can confirm its contents. Prior to this inspection, of course, you have already selected and armed yourself with the plastic squeeze bottle of the hot sauce of your choice (vinegary red or spicy green). For the two seconds the lid is open, liberally apply the sauce.You pay for your meal, leave a tip for the hard working staff, and head out with your flavorful booty. If it's a hot summer day and the air conditioner above the front door is running, be sure to time your exit to avoid the large drops of water leaking from its pan. There are a few seats inside if you want to eat in, but if you don't want to (or can't) take it back to your office, walk over to the park in front of Macy's and eat there instead.Regardless of your container size, the portions are not for the faint of heart or the carb-o-phobic. Here's a sample of the mains:PernilBeef short ribsOxtailBBQ chickenJerk chickenBacalaoOnions and potatoesPork chopsPepper steakThe chicken leg is enormous. Drumstick and thigh, it will not fit in the small container without a bone sticking out the side. The oxtail and the ribs are good, as I recall, but the plastic fork will be an inferior eating utensil compared to your fingers. The bacalao and the onions and potatoes have their respective followings but I haven't tried them.My favorite is the pernil with yellow rice, lentils, maduros, and a generous shot of green hot sauce. The tender, shredded pork shoulder is perfectly seasoned, accented with garlic and the bite of black pepper without overpowering the flavor of the meat itself. You might find an occasional bone or a portion of pork skin. The green hot sauce may be hotter on some days than others. When it is hotter, the sweetness of the maduros will temper the heat, which is why it's best to order them when fully ripened. When the green sauce is not as hot, the maduros will be a tasty dessert. Regardless, apply the hot sauce generously, where it and juices from the pork will filter into the rice and lentils for a heady mix of flavors. This is a hearty lunch at half the cost of the food factories lining Seventh Ave.",34,0.9921

1681,7,2,4.0,"Counter is a place to go for a special meal for moderate prices - i.e., they take care with their ingredients, plating/presentation, and flavors; and the entrees cost about $14-18. This is partly why some previous yelpers complained of being hungry still - because like other haute cuisine type places, the plates will not be heaping with food, as is typical of more ordinary places. I will admit, my friend's ravioli seemed abysmally small, while the panini is definitely a ""normal"" portion. On the other hand, if you also get an appetizer, I guarantee you will be stuffed. Except for the direct view of a very bright McDonald's across the street, the interior design is also lovely but simple (with nice bathrooms).I've been here a few times now, and each time was a joy. The wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. On one occasion, I called for a reservation, and the host didn't mind that I was not exactly sure just how many people were coming that same night (just had to overestimate than underestimate). No one complained when my party arrived late, either, and our table was ready even though the place was packed (on a Tuesday). Last time around, we had the waiitress select three appetizers for us - we had the hummos, gnocchi and plate of three types of fritters. Each was delicious. The hummos was very fragrant, and the pita bread that accompanied it was thick and warm (which they kept coming since the helping of hummos was so generous). The gnocchi was amazingly delicious - and I ordinarily despise the potato pasta as being too dense and sticky. I had the cauliflower risotto this time around, and it was absolutely delicious. The cauliflower was very flavorful - although I did not expect these deep fried stick like things instead of the usual long grain rice I'm accustomed to for rissotto. The lentil panini is quite good, also.I had lots to drink and it's all good! They serve beautiful organic wines, beers and liquors. The martinis are absolutely delicious -- I highly recommend the ""Tie me to the Bedpost"", made with herb-infused organic vodkas - it had a sweet base but is not too sweet (not my thing) because of the vodka. I also tried the Not tonight Dear, made with fresh raspberries - also delicious! They also garnish their martinis very beautifully (with cranberries attached to sage, which they light for some fragrance; or fresh whole raspberries on a toothpick.)You can get a flight of three organic wines for $16 - and each glass is pretty full for a flight (unlike some places -- talking about 1/3 to 1/2 a serving each). The burgundy is worth a whole bottle.Come to Counter - support some alternate food styles and enjoy (this, coming from a non-vegetarian, btw).",10,0.9986

My bf's parents were in town to celebrate his birthday and ended up staying at the Marriot Marquis in Times Square. We wanted to avoid the tourists (who were, for the most part, settling into their Broadway matinees), but still stay in the Midtown area since we were heading to the Apple Store next. Couldn't for the life of me think of a nice place to eat above 50th Street and east of 7th. Until *ding ding ding*I remembered Serafina!I had only eaten dinner at Serafina, which was always pretty good. Really great selection of brick oven pizzas and tons of pastas to choose from. I figured brunch couldn't be far off the mark either, and it wasn't. My bf and I opted for brunch - we both ordered the salmon eggs benedict (which is my absolute fave kind of benedict) - and we weren't disappointed. It came with three eggs atop three english muffins with just the right amount of salmon underneath. It was a hearty meal indeed. His parents both ordered pastas (penne w/vodka sauce and another one with chicken & peas...can't remember the name) and enjoyed them, as well.So now I know that Serafina is a good option for meals at either end of the day. It's also great for large groups (they even have a semi-private room in the back) and it stays open late, so if you're trying to figure out where to go after a Broadway show, you won't be disappointed here. The ladies' bathroom is cool too b/c they project an old silent movie onto the floor so you can mix some pleasure in with your business.----Update 9.01.07: Don't know if this is a new addition to their brunch bread basket, but I tried their corn muffins for the first time and they are off the hook!!

1701,9,2,4.0,"Not the greatest sushi in terms of quality... BUT, here's 5 reasons why I think everyone should try it at least once:1. The 2nd floor's a nicely decorated Japanese restaurant. the 1st floor is a sushi 'bar,' where all the seats/bar stools are placed around this circular conveyor belt. 2-3 sushi chefs are in the center, making all types of maki/sushi/tapa dishes. They place them on the conveyor belt, and you can pick whichever plate you want as it goes around and around. It's a really unique experience - apparently a lot of sushi bars in Japan do this. 2. It caters to your price range. The plate colors denote a certain price, with each plate being 1.00, 1.50, 2.00... up to 4.50 I think. Which means if you're a california roll eater, you can get plates of $1 maki rolls and walk out happy.3. It's like Chinese dim-sum for sushi. What's great is that if you don't see something you like going around, you can special-request a dish and they'll make it for you (which is also good if the jerk next to you keeps taking the dish you're waiting for - too bad the conveyor belt doesn't change directions).4. GREAT place for a date - I think it'd impress any foodie who's into sushi/unique restaurants. And the sushi is still okay quality. 5. Last of all, if you like the place you should apply for their membership. It's a $20 membership, which includes 10% off the bill everytime you go there, and you'll get a $20 gift card. and you'll get a few other $10 gift cards mailed to you throughout the year.

When one goes for a brazilian every 4 to 6 weeks it's all, hey no problem, the hair grows in thinner and it's not really painful and it's over like that. Well recent circumstances are such that I have not paid Lee a visit in about four months. I was essentially a brazilian bikini waxing virgin all over again. Here goes. Wax on...press...wax off. HOLYSWEETJESUSMOTHERFUCK!!!!!!! It hurts! It really hurts! I was seeing little pink and orange spots floating about my head. I suddenly don't understand why people engage in this barbaric ritual.

For those who have never experienced this type of pain, when you get a brazilian bikini wax it releases the same endorphins in your brain as when you say, jump out of an airplane, kind of like fear and exhilaration combined. So when the wax is over, you leave with a big old head rush and therefore it is the kind of pain you forget.  Lesson of the Day: Ladies, don't miss your waxing appointments.

As you chill at a table with your friends, an attentive staff member will actually bring your order directly to you, a rarity in similar places.The menu is mostly low-fat, the meat and poultry are antibiotic and nitrate-free, the fries are organic and air-baked. With the burgers, you won't notice much of a drop-off in flavor, but you'll definitely be compromising with the fries if you're used to the hard stuff. Not a big deal, though.

1713,6,10,4.0,"Warning: If you hate snobs, do not read this review.The most important thing to note about this little bakery, situated on Spring just east of Lafayette, is that its pastries are infinitely better than those at Balthazar, which is on the other side of Spring on the other side of Lafayette, about thirty yards away. (I was going to say a hundred times better, or a thousand times better, but I really mean infinitely: Balthazar's pastries are basically on par with those at Au Bon Pain.) Once in a while when I'm feeling skinny, or sad enough to self-indulge, or just when the weather feels right, I get a plain croissant from Ceci Cela for breakfast. It flakes all over my desk as I try to eat it (no wonder my office has mice), and the inside is soft and buttery and delicious. It is the closest I've gotten in New York to a real French croissant. [This wasn't always the case: Le Pain Quotidien had delicious pastries when it first opened about eight years ago, but now that its business model has begun to imitate Starbucks's, the quality has gone way down.] I haven't branched out to other pastries--though I think I once had a bite of a delicious pain au chocolat--but they all look pretty good and authentic. There's a lovely little space at the back of the bakery where I guess people can order real food and coffee and things. I think there might even be outdoor space; this is SoHo, so think tiny tables, tiny chairs, tiny people. But crawl space is the new breathing room! so Ceci Cela is trendy. I give this place four stars because it'd be nice if I could also buy my coffee here. The coffee they make isn't bad, but it also isn't so good. The other reason for the fifth star's absence is that there is this simple sandwich they sell, brie on baguette, that is sometimes delicious and sometimes crappy. I've gotten it with stale bread (at a bakery, I find this unacceptable) and, worse, with rather tasteless brie. I will say, however, that someone I work with eats this sandwich every day, sometimes for breakfast and sometimes for lunch. I find this palatal flexibility impressive, and for some reason I like seeing this sandwich on his desk every day when I walk down the hall. It's better to look at than to eat, though. As for the staff, I can't tell if I hate them because they have cool haircuts and work in a trendy French bakery in SoHo or like them because they are nice. The latter would be the more normal thing to do, but what can I say.",7,0.9932

And there are no Go Go Dancers, despite the name, which was a huge disappointment.The reason there are no carts is because everything is made fresh, and that's a good thing. This place is slightly (and only slightly) more pricey than other dim sum places in the area. You end up paying perhaps a quarter more per dish, but in return, you get very fresh dim sum that hasn't been wheeled around in a cart for 30 minutes. That is, in my opinion, well worth a quarter, and it's still very cheap overall.Whenever I see those dim sum carts being frantically wheeled around, it makes me think of patients being wheeled around in gurneys on episodes of ""E.R."" anyway.

It can get crowded at lunch time, so I enjoy it for a good greasy breakfast or late-night dinner. At diners, you can get away with the bare minimum of communication. There are pictures on the menu and no weird deviations. No one asks you how you want anything cooked or what side dish you want with your entree. You order, you eat, you pay. Red Flame serves one of my favorite soups of all-time: Avgolemono Soup. It's a creamy chicken soup with lemon and usually some sort of noodle - here they make it with orzo. My best friend's mom made it for us when we were kids and it is one of the most comforting things in the world to me, and I believe the only cure for the common cold.Burgers are good - and the fries are decent. You can also get vegetarian burgers, turkey burgers, and now, bison burgers! The coleslaw comes in one of those little mushy paper cups which is about the size of a shot glass - right out of the 50's. They have a section on the menu called ""Diet Delights"" - remember the old ""Diet Plate"" with scoops of things like tuna salad and cottage cheese? Bunless burgers? Yup, still going strong here.Tonight's meal: soup, burger, and a piece of cherry pie. Mmmmmm mmmmmm.  With a glass of good old NYC tap water. One day, and one day soon, I will try one of the ""French Skyscraper Ice Cream Sodas"" which is ""Topped With Mountains of Pure Heavy Whipped Cream"". How could I NOT?They offer FREE DELIVERY but I would not pass up a chance to sit at the counter or at the small booths that are just perfect for one person. The place is cozy and charming, with its covered cake plates and vinyl seats, and rolling rack in the middle of the floor for heavy coats. It's also a place where you can be completely anonymous, which is a wonderful thing. Service is efficient and just friendly enough. I don't know if it means that I am not a feminist, but I find it endearing to be called ""my dear"".Red Flame is not a destination spot, but a good choice if you are in the area - much better than many of the overpriced mediocre restaurants that plague midtown. It's very close to the theater district, so would be a good choice if time and money are of concern, or if you just want a simple, filling meal._______________________________________________I love that I am staying at a hotel in a $545/night room and my entire dinner at Red Flame cost $14. The burger at my hotel costs $32 on its own. Somehow now I feel more balanced.",12,0.9967
1717,3,2,4.0,"OK, I'm a big enough person to admit that I was wrong. If this is the first time you're reading this review, you might want to go down below the *** and read that part first. Update: We called the owner, who in fact was not the person I had originally spoken with, and she was so apologetic. She asked us to come back, and we did, and we had a great meal. I was wary after reading other reviews which dissed the food for lack of taste, but our dishes were really good, and not just ""really good for Jersey City."" The service was fantastic; friendly without being overbearing, and the atmosphere was very relaxing with perfect lighting and music. We had pheasant fricasee and moules frites, and a duck confit appetizer, and were very satisfied. We will definitely go back.********************I can't review the food because I've never eaten at this place, although not for lack of trying. It's close to a fifteen minute walk for us to get there, but we thought we'd try it out because we normally eat so late and this is one downtown JC restaurant that serves food after hours, and because they are BYO. I made the latest reservation I could, at 10:30 pm on a Thursday, and we arrived at 10:34. It didn't look promising as the chairs were all up on the tables, and we walked in to see the staff either carrying out bags of trash or dancing. ""We're closed,"" they told us. When I said I had a reservation, first they claimed to know nothing about it, then they said that there was a ""problem with the bathroom."" They hadn't called to tell us that they were closing early; this might have been because I wasn't asked for my phone number when my reservation was taken. Although they apologized in a rather perfunctory way, it was clear that the two women working there were eager for us to leave so that they could get back to leaving work early. I called the next day, and another worker told me ""actually, the bathroom has been fixed for a while."" So I assume that someone f**ked up, told a partial lie about the bathroom (there had indeed been a problem, only not on the night that we were there), and we were left with half an hour walking in the cold with no alternative places to go.I've been trying to get in touch with the owner, with whom I made the original reservation, to see if she can convince me that we should try again. If so, I'd be happy to revise my review as I would love it if there were a good late-night BYO place on this side of the river.",5,0.9956

My fried oyster po-boy ($13) had close to 12 fried oysters on it and about a foot and a haf of the authentic (but pretty crappy even in New Orleans) bread. The poppers were killer btw.

However, once I reached the back it was a different story as my work group had managed to commandeer nearly all of the seating and thus made for a comfortable experience the rest of the evening. Not to be overlooked is the fact that they also serve food here and at a very reasonable price. While I did not choose to partake in a dining experience, my co-workers had only positive things to say about their eats.

It is one of the places I trust to order them very rare.This local place also has excellent pizza, souvlaki, salads and other Italian sandwiches and platters. Note: they are Greek, but they do pizza, etc. as well - if not better - than most places. Not to be outdone, their french fries are some of the best around, and addictive. If I am driving by, I immediately turn into a raving carnivore. One burger usually does the job, but you could easily eat two, if you are having them for dinner. Something about this burger really hits the spot. Even having had a single order, a four-hour drive later I am still too full to eat. I have not been here for at least a year, (having lived in the neighborhood for awhile before moving back to Manhattan), but the staff still remembers me.

You can only play on so many beer-drenched tables, hitting walls every time you try to make a shot.We hit AB on a Tuesday night and were surprised to find it bustling. The host told us it would be about a 20 minute wait so we got a drink at the bar. There's a small loungey area that's a nice addition for whiling away time waiting for a table. The bar staff is notably different from before, all female and of the ditzy, giggly variety. Interesting. I suppose they must have mostly male clientele.I had plenty of time to observe them as the wait increased to about an hour. The host kept us from leaving with a free round of drinks. There looked to be a tournament going on. I understand that a lot of the old clientele moved downtown with the pool hall. Maybe that was why, but the patrons looked older and somewhat B&T, esp for a Tuesday night! After finally scoring a table, I forgot about the bartenders and the crowd. It was nice to play on a clean table and just enjoy the game. Despite all the people who brought their own cues, there seemed to be a shortage. It took us a few minutes to find a couple.I gave this place 4 stars because I love the laid back ambience and once you get a table, you can play in peace. Prices are reasonable, both for tables and drinks. I am a bit concerned about the wait, and hope it was an anomaly.

I made a tour bus stop in San Juan so I can get an empanada from a street vendor. I even made the pilgrimage to the Arepa Lady in Jackson Heights to try one of her arepas (yelp.com/biz/PLweq3kub4f…)So take my lack of objectivity (or abundance of partiality if you're a glass half full type) into account when reading the below:The food here is very good. Service sucks and take out always takes a couple minutes longer than you'd think it should take. That's the only reason I can't give this place a 5th star....You'll see frequent mention of hot sauce and garlic sauce in my review of various dishes. They provide both at the tables (or in the take out bag) and both are great. The hot sauce is somewhat self-explanatory - the garlic sauce is this creamy sauce that's as garlicky as any sauce I've ever had but is sooo good on roast pork....BrunchNice chill mood. Rarely any type of line. Nice counterpoint to Sarabeth's across the street.Cinnamon French Toast - Nicely done. They seem to use Italian bread and slice it fairly thin. The cinnamon and powdered sugar add sweetness but not too much. Despite the thin slices, there's enough on the plate to fill you up (note: two eggs can be added for $1. sometimes they'll throw in a free side like sweet plantains)Eggs Benedict w/ Roast Pork or w/ Chorizo - Very good. Two differences from the standard eggs benedict: 1) A lot more meat. This dish has a ton of meat and 2) Instead of hollandaise sauce, you can use the hot and creamy garlic sauces. I found the hot sauce worked best. Throw in a side dish and charge $8.95 and it's a great value. Only eggs benedict I've had in NYC that is more satisfying is the one at Jane's (that includes Sarabeth's).Huevos Rancheros - Tasty but note it's fried eggs not scrambled.AppsBlack Bean Soup - They don't have this all the time but it's a good black bean soup. Needs a little hot sauce in it to wake it up.Empanadas - They've got chicken, beef, and vegetable but run out sometimes. I like the chicken best. Not the BEST empanada I've ever had but it's not like I could pop into frigin' Zabar's or Fairway for one, you know?Arepas de Yuca - These aren't like the Arepa sandwiches found in some Latin places or like the Mozzarepa which is a sweet corn/white cheese concoction found in NYC street fairs. These are like 5 corn meal discs. Pretty tasty but I recommend the empanadas over these.Mofongo - Mashed plantains with crispy pork. I don't like it. Not a coincidence that the first four letters in this dish are Mofo.SaladsAguacate (Avocado) - Tasty. Good amount of avocado for the price.Side OrdersMaduros (Sweet Plantains) - Very good. A bit greasier than Flor de Mayo's but still worth it in my book.SandwichesCubano - Good. I don't get it very often though b/c these give me serious food coma. It's common knowledge that Fidel and Che forbid consumption of this sandwich to prevent lethargy among the revolutionaries. Pernll (Pork) - I like this one better than the Cubano. I douse it in the Garlic sauce and then add hot sauce. Given that the rest of my diet isn't too garlic heavy, it's always interesting to see how my body reacts to the garlic infusion. Well, for me anyway.Pollo (Chicken) - Good choice if you want something less heavy than the cubano or pork. I add a good amount of hot sauce to it.Rice DishesTwo noteworthy items here: 1) They have paella for one here and it's only $14. What's w/ all the 2 person minimum bullshit on paella in this city? Is it that hard to create a single serving of paella? Can't they buy smaller pots?2) They've got saffron rice dishes that allow you to stop short of a paella if you're not feeling up for a full seafood and meat medley. I like the chicken and chorizo version best (only $10!!!).ChickenChicharron de Pollo (Fried Chicken) - Tasty stuff. But, really, when isn't fried chicken tasty. Pollo a la Brasa - Good but I like Flor de Mayo's a bit better.  The hot sauce goes pretty well with this.PorkPernil Asado - This is just a big platter o' roast pork w/ some beans and rice on the side. I suggest the pork sandwich unless you've got some other conspirators - I love pork but by the end of this dish I get to thinking that Samuel L Jackson might've been right about swine in Pulp Fiction. BeefPicadillo - This is a chopped beef dish. It was good but I only consider it as part of the lunch special.Ropa Vieja - Same goes for this.SeafoodShrimp in coconut or mango sauce - Good stuff.  Mixing either of these sauces in w/ the rice. Mmm. Desserts/Coffees Rum cake - Eh. Tropical Shakes - Pretty damn tasty.

IMO, the view isn't really that great, or maybe that's just because I've seen it a hundred times. The prices are high, and rising - I think tickets were actually $15 when I worked there. The photo packages were $25 when I started, but a co-worker told me it was just $15 when he started a few months before I did. Although, for $17.50, you can't get a better view of the skyline and Central Park.The view is best on the upper two levels. On one side is the entirety of Central Park, on the other side you get a good view of the Empire State Building and can see as far as Staten Island. Take your photos on the top deck (70th floor I think?), because it's the only one without those reflective glass walls.I'm also going to point out that if the photographers offer to take your photo, you aren't force to buy it. You can view it at the store downstairs, and online for 15(?) days. Don't like it? Don't buy it. The reason I point this out is because visitors often reject the photographers like spam (meanies!), but then end up regretting it when they reach the store at the end of the tour.Also worth mentioning - the security guards patrolling the top are friendly and talkative. Don't shy away from asking questions or if you need someone to take a photo with your camera.On a random, slightly disturbing note, I'm convinced I'm destiny-bonded to this place and that I'll eventually die here.",13,-0.3008

They are new, so the service is still uneven, but if/whenever your server if you have any questions, say YES. Don't be polite, ask exactly what to expect out of each element of your dessert so you won't be disappointed or surprised.

However, my partner ordered Crystal Plum Sake Anmitsu with not a lot of questions, and it turned out to be a glass of clear, almost flavorless jelly cubes in a subtle sake sauce, mini mochi balls, which was not what he expected or really wanted after looking at my chocolate cake. Don't let that discourage you though, he just didn't know what he was getting into, it was fine if you wanted a jelly-like, minimal sweetness, very light soupy thing.Everything else that came out looked gorgeous and really tasty. The ingredients might be new to you, and if you are someone who feels guilt at indulging in sweets, (sorry can't relate) the ingredients are highly nutritious, healthy, vegan for the most part, so indulge away.Closed Mondays though, so plan ahead.",5,0.9953

Not only that, but you were virtually empty when we arrived, so we didn't have to face the dreaded wait or cramped quarters. Your food was delicously spicy and finger-licking good. Your chili crab (almost) made me forget about the lobster roll I was craving - and missing - at Pearl's.

This man is probably the computer guy at your office. Mild, unassuming, slightly awkward--he wears glasses and keeps to himself. But, on those certain nights, when the moon is full and the music is right, this dude goes off on his cowbell. He pounds on it like a starved monkey trying to crack a coconut. He's in a zone.

She was beautiful, smart, and funny and wanted desperately to impress her. She worked down the street and was familiar with Rice menu. Although I tried not to show it, I was a nervous wreak. When it came to ordering I asked her what her favorite dish was and ordered that, the waitress asked if we wanted anything to start and my date said ""Do you want to get some edamame?"" ""Sure!"" I said not knowing what edamame was. The waitress returned several minutes later with a bowl of perfectly steamed and salted edamame. I watched how my date ate them and did the same, slipping the edamame peas into my mouth, hoping they didn't taste terrible. They were great. About halfway through our meal, I was keenly aware that I had some serious gas. This gas only intensified as the night wore on and a bar later, I was in serious pain trying desperately not to fart in front of this girl. I held, what I imagined to be the mother of all farts, back. ""Jesus,"" I said to myself in the bathroom mirror after I had excused myself, ""what are in those things?"" My only thought was that the edamame were exacting retribution for actions perpetrated by my ancestors in the pacific theater during World War ll. To make a long story shorter, The night was a huge success. Holding back the fart took my mind off being nervous and I impressed the girl so much we dated for years.

ALWAYS get the CANADIAN SWINE ...I mean BACON - 1 piece per person is the bare minimum you should order, it's like swallowing the most fragrant pork ever..if you didn't eat pork before, you will tonight!4. SKIP the tomato and onion side dish. Waste of calories and money. Don't even bother with the salads unless you haven't had a BM in a couple days....Famous Potatoes are okay....I don't even bother with any of the other stuff...get it if your are really hungry. 5. The Desserts are good - the Holy Cow Sundae is delish, the Cheesecake is great with the SHLAG...6. Overall ambiance has a tavern feel...wood planks all over, PL keeps it real...especially with the seasoned tall waiters in their white shirts, black bow tie and white apron.  PL shows us that they stay unique by keeping it real....staying true to the holy power of pure steak. ***Not 5 stars because our waiter was way tooo dry***",4,0.9831

It was a very cold day, overcast and windy. I made my way via subway and by foot over to this hulking behemoth of a bagel factory.It appears situated between the Intrepid battle cruiser, a car wash, and what appears to be a graveyard of street vendor carts. This all looked even weirder by the dark gray light of the day.I went inside the building and saw an interior which was all business. There was a counter, some holding pen/display boxes of bagels, and some fridges along the side w/ drinks and cream cheeses.I got some onion, some plain, a bialy, and some everything bagels. I also picked up a scallion cream cheese I had never heard of an a tiny brick of Philly cream cheese.Since there is nowhere to eat there I headed over to the Intrepid to sit on a bench. It was quite cold.I started with the bialy - it wasn't to bad, definitely up there as far as bialies go. I then tried a plain. I wasn't wowed. It was definitely better than anything you can get outside of NYC, but it wasn't earth shattering. As such I tried the scallion cream cheese on the plain - bad call. The cheese was NOT up to snuff...So a little discouraged, and a lot cold, I headed back to my place.Later that evening I was hungry and thought I should give H&H one more chance and pulled out an everything and bit into it.Heaven.Absolute Heaven.That was the tastiest raw (as in no toppings) everything bagel I have EVER had.

When you come in for hairstyling, they also give you a 20 dollar credit towards any B&B hair products, so that's kind of cool.The reason I give it a 4?1) Apptments are only available on weekdays, usually @ 12:30 or 2 pm.2) The whole process takes about 3 - 4 hours, u have to wait for a training class, then you have to wait for the instructor to inspect it, then you get it cut again, then wait for inspection. 3) You might not get someone who has worked with your type of hair. They invite hairstylists from all over the US who own salons that only sell B&B, ( not necessarily a B&B salon ), and they try to teach them their techniques to go with the styling products.

I of course spoke to the other host, Jonathan, who was wonderful and offered to buy us a round of drinks for the inconvenience, personally seeking out a table for us within the next ten minutes.Finally, our table is ready and lo-and-behold, one of my shopping bags from Zara was missing! Jonathan the nice Host, my friend and I looked frantically for it, only to find it across the room under another patron's chair! After retrieving it myself and having some not-so-kind words with the bag-stealer, we finally sat down, only to have Craig come up stairs and scream in my face about me ""accusing"" someone of stealing my things. How on earth could my bag end up half way across the room, wedged under someone else's chair in between their things, completely upright? After badgering me, obnoxiously telling me how wrong I was and to (sarcastically) 'enjoy my night' Craig finally left...and our waitress and Jonathan did nothing but apologize for Craig's rude behavior, saying that they get a LOT of complaints about him. YIKES.All this aside, Dip gets four stars for cute decor, great bartenders, commendable damage-control service and delicious food... although the chicken in the Buffalo Chicken Skewers was a little dry, the Tex Mex fondue was absolutely delectable, and the S'mores dessert was to die for!I'll go back, but you bet I will call there and see if Craig is working.",9,-0.8322

They're good to me and my crazy ""i don't actually do anything, yet I have no time to do anything"" lifestyle. i know people don't believe, but it really is cheaper than the grocery store if you're having stuff delivered. And everyone worries about the produce, but for the most part, it's pretty damn good and fresh. If you're worried, buy your produce elsewhere, but for normal groceries stuff it's really unbeatable. I also really do like the pre-prepared stuff. Their salads are fantastic. The reason it's not a five-star, though, is that yeah, you do get the occasional bad apple, or burst open yogurt, or cracked eggs, or broken Hummus container. And yeah, sometimes, they're late and it ruins your plans, but it's a small price to pay for the convenience of ""click-click, ding-dong"" groceries. I love me some Fresh Direct.",15,0.9612

I've had many a group dinner and it's difficult to cut through the chaos of ordering on both ends of the table and getting servers to take your drink orders in a timely fashion. Bao 111 solves this issue by providing prix fixe, preplanned menus. When we sat down, we immediately were served the first round of appetizers and the food continued to flow effortlessly . I never once had to think about what I wanted to eat or when it was coming. We were all provided printed menus though so we knew what was in front of us. So great! And the food that did come forth was fantastic! I sampled various dishes including shrimp toast, spring and summer rolls, calamari stuffed wth prawn (very interesting looking combo), and basa fish curry. I can't remeber what else. All were excellent. Then FOUR types of dessert came out. My goodness, my stomach was never so happy. What a fantastic deal! The servers were very attentive and drinks were readily forthcoming.

Recently I had dinner with someone else and, having suggested we split two things, I chose one; then I was going back and forth on what the second should be, and he said, ""Wait, you picked the first one, I get to pick this one."" It was a reality check: I really have to get some new friends.] The omelette was not overcooked (I hate anything that's cooked too long) and the cheese was strong and beautifully melted, and having a little tomato with each bite is lovely. The pancakes were thin and perfectly cooked and I was really in heaven about them.  Then I returned this past weekend. This time my friends and I got to sit outside, which was very pleasant. But the romance of the place was a little lost for me. First of all, the cute single serving French presses just seem to take up a lot of space, and the coffee is not delicious. It's fine, it's good, but it doesn't give that ""The future is bright"" buzz I get halfway through a cup of super strong coffee. Though the orange juice is fresh, it's sort of half-fresh--like it's still expensive and better than Tropicana, but was purchased elsewhere rather than squeezed on-site. (They'd be better served--or I would be, I guess--to make coffee in a large vat and serve those little hand-juicers to everyone who orders juice.) The real disappointment, though, was the pancakes.

1799,2,10,4.0,"If you absolutely need a wedge of stilton hand-crafted in 1820s by the cousins of welsh nuns, Murray's is the place for you. They sell cheeses here which I could never have dreamed existed for consumption, and I've had cheese-related reveries an average of several times a day for years. The selection is insultingly extensive, and they even have a ""cheese cave"" which allows for prime oogling of massive wheels of treasure.That said, the J. Peterman-style blurbs on everything got me down a little bit. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad the staff feels that every bite of their gouda is a lavendar-laced flight of fancy through the 16th century Flemish countryside or whatever they put on the label. However, personally I prefer my big wheels of mold without so much hype, and the slick marketing pitch makes me suspicious. Maybe I'm just bitter that Murray's is so well-lit and un-romantic. I like a little mystery with my curds, like I found at the weird, stinky, all-cheese restaurant I visited in paris. It was dingy and bizarre and I think it had a broken elevator. It was out of this world. By contrast, Murray's is bright and clean, not stinky at all, and feels like Bloomindales.The main problem with Murray's though, and I can't believe no other yelp reviewer has mentioned this, is that the prices are fairly panic-inducing. There are only a handful of options under 10 dollars a pound, and most are closer to 20 bucks a pound. This makes Murray's a pretty far reach for those of us who aren't being kept as mistresses by a wealthy uptown ""cheddar daddy.""I respect that you have to pay more for something really special, and I'm happy to do so, but at Murray's it seems that even the dairy goods that are not very rare or difficult to find are marked up to suit a Gotti-style tax bracket. I guess this is to help fund the many cheese-seeking expeditions which Murray's buyers must undergo to discover Reggianos available only in Atlantis, and all those kinds of delicacies. In summation, Murray's isn't that charming and it's sure not affordable, but if you have the cash and want something really special, the selection at Murray's cannot be beat.",2,0.8736

Even if you're not sitting at one of the sun-drenched tables placed between the iron columns punctuating the facade, you can choose to wear your sunglasses indoors - or, push them up to rest above your forehead. Hot stuff! Now let's fix your Italian-made Oxford. Undo the top buttons. Not bad, but you need one more. Good. Are your sleeves rolled up? Fine. So, it's almost time to join the line clogging the entrance and wait a while for a table. But before we do, turn around to catch the proud drivers of a Ferrari and Lamborghini, respectively, gun their motors as they each take five years to park on the corner, 10 feet from the curb. It's important that you have time to SEE them driving the cars. Because the flaming red paint jobs might not have been enough to attract your attention. So, we've managed to elbow our way to the brusque hostess and put our names on the list. She acts as though we've just asked her to clean up your dog's crap, but we know that's just her tough love. Take a moment to survey the room - sky high ceilings and French doors thrown wide open to the beautiful day, tables packed into every available inch, vintage French posters on the wall. It looks great, doesn't it? Judging from the huge crowd, everyone else thinks so too.  At last we're ready to be seated. Remember to pull your chair in as close as possible to the table so that the rushed waiters can squeeze by. And for God's sakes, be careful when you fling your jacket over the seat back - you nearly took out your neighbor's wineglass. Take your time - peruse the menu, because the servers won't be by to take your drink orders for a few minutes. Note the fine selection of French themed dishes - the eggs Benedict looks particularly good. AND they're served with mesclun salad and fries, all for $12.50. But first things first - order up a couple of pitchers of mojitos for the table. The fresh mint and limes will soothe your soul, and the alcohol will soothe your hangover. The food has arrived - damn fast, given the crowds - and it's good. Not outstanding, but then, we came to be part of the action, not to have a gourmet meal. Once we're finished, the bill also arrives fairly quickly, repeated requests for a dessert menu notwithstanding, and it seems more than reasonable for eight people. But maybe that's because the non-drinkers are subsidizing the cost of all those mojitos you drank.  What are you doing? Enjoying the dregs of your coffee? Get moving!

For those of us who don't live in Red Hook, Baked is a little bit of a trek. You have to take the F/G to Smith/9th Street and then hop on the B77 bus (on the same side as the subway exit). Knowing that there are excellent cupcakes and other original dessert concoctions on the horizon, the trip is well worth it. The space at Baked is clean, open, and mellow with lots of personality. This last characteristic is apparent in their cakes and desserts, which are mainly modernized versions of old-fashioned American classics (for example, their icebox cake, which was recently featured in Food & Wine, is an elegant tower of homemade chocolate wafers, layered with chocolate pastry cream and topped with whipped cream). But yes - the cupcakes. First, i need to say that i am not a fan of the copycat cupcakes all over the city - dry cake overcompensated by a glob of gritty, overly sweet buttercream. That being said, i'm also not a fan of Swiss meringue buttercream that tastes like whipped butter and leaves an oily coating down your throat. The cupcakes at Baked have a moist, tender cake and a buttercream that tastes like a mix between a Swiss meringue and a classic American buttercream - the flavors are delicate, the texture smooth and the finish clean. Next time i go to Baked i'm going to make a day of it - there's an unharried vibe there that reminds me of certain cafes in San Francisco. They also serve lunch. And Gorilla coffee. P.S.

The menu at DuMont Burger features just the highlights from the original's menu, but really, what do you need beyond the perfect burger, the uber-rich mac&cheese, and the addictive fries? And they've added a DuMont Mini Burger, which is not slider mini at all...it's the regular burger, sized down just enough that you can eat the whole thing without feeling ill. The full bar, friendly staff, and cozy decor round out the experience nicely. One complaint - they don't (or don't yet) offer the DuMont salad, and that is a shame.",1,0.9108

In addition to the funky environment and lunch deals the great drink specials, Margherita mondays, beg you to return. And when you do return the waitstaff will smile and remember you. AND if you frequent often enough they will remember your name and serve you the lunch special at night with an extra large bowl of smooth and creamy black bean soup. This place is a neighborhood favorite, a great excape from the frat scene on third ave. NOTE: This prices have gone up yet again.

Their authentic soul food was very good although a tad bit greasy, but I believe everyone deserves a ""fat day"" once in a blue moon.

As if at any moment, the gorgeous, kimonoed waitresses may whip out katana and garnish your lychee martini with the limbs of an unruly customer.Not unlike the film genre, Decibel ranges from brain-crushingly awful to suprisingly great. Sometimes, by which I mean on weekdays, the service is friendly, you can sit immediately and enjoy a great bottle of sake or too many lychee martinis with edamame and shrimp dumplings and have a cozy, unique, impress-the-guests with your manhattan prowess or magical-first-date kind of night.Other times, by which I mean on weekends, they practically pat you down on your way in, if you're wiling to wait behind the entry rope for a table and then remind you half a dozen times about the $8/person minimum, get your drink orders wrong, argue with you about it and chase you out the door demanding a larger tip and threatening not to let you in again. So much potential, so often wasted. When it's great, there's nothing like it: a dark little basement sake bar with more ambiance than you can swallow and lychee martinis I still dream about.

Anyhow, this place is expensive but I liked it a lot before I noticed that. I bought a plastic owl here to scare away pigeons and I still have the dear old bird.

Over 6,000 volumes, organized by the Dewey Decimal System (remember those days?), are placed throughout the hotel for guests to peruse and enjoy. It's a small hotel with 60 thematic rooms. We were in 400.003 Languages: Germanic - Although, my father is a 1/4 German we never went beyond the occasional 'danke', so the lovely German story and poetry books went unread. The illustrations were nice though! We're hoping for The Arts next time around. Our room was very small but so beautifully detailed, we almost forgot that we had to take turns walking across the room to avoid a low impact collision. Dark wood furnishings accented with celadon and gold tones gave the room warmth and sophistication. The hotel staff was a bit sparse but friendly and pleasant when encountered. Pulling art and photography books off the many shelves reminded me of school days and trips to the library... but more fun. There isn't a restaurant in the hotel but you can dine on a simple breakfast, afternoon tea or evening wine and cheese in the Reading Room. You'll find tables and lounge-friendly sofas surrounded by walls of books. Upstairs, in the writer's den, are big club chairs, a fireplace and terrace with a view. Before a night out, we had a glass of champagne in the outdoor Poetry Garden and enjoyed a view of the vibrant city lights.  The Library Hotel is not your typical New York swank-as-all-get-out place to stay. It has a special personality that you won't find in a lot of places, and it's quite modest by comparison. If you love books or just want something a little different, you'll find this place quite enchanting. Staying here was such a treat.

With more than nine thousand objects comprising its permanent collection, the Museum of Sex offers a studied and sometimes clinical look at the history of sex in our culture, utilizing drawings, paintings, photographs, film, video, and ancient artifacts to achieve its goal. Past exhibits have included one exploring how NYC transformed sex in America, with displays of 19th-century brothels, videos of Times Square in its sleazy heyday, and S&M paraphernalia, and another dedicated to 2,500 years of Chinese obsession with the erotic. Their latest acquisition - a collection of pornography including more than four hundred 8-millimeter films, seven hundred videos, 1,500 magazines, one hundred books, and quaint artifacts such as blow-up dolls - is less shocking for its content than it is for the identity of its original owner, Ralph Whittington, who recently retired as a curator at the Library of Congress after thirty-eight years of service.
