And sometimes there's a refrigerator, but it's hidden. I didn't know I had one in my room until I was about to leave one week and noticed a humming noise inside the tv cabinet, and the tv was off. The housekeeping staff tries to get on your good side by giving you little chocolates each night. The wireless connection is good everywhere but the top floor, where it comes in only in some rooms, and then it goes off and on intermittently. There's also a continental breakfast FOR THE TOP FLOOR ONLY. I don't get it at all. They don't tell you about it unless you're on the \"executive level.\" Like it's such a big deal! It's the same cereal, coffee and crappy pasteries you'll find anywhere, except worse. What a load of bullshit. TV stations are limited and seem to vary by the room (No Comedy Central sometimes). Some bathrooms have a tub, others have a big glass shower with a powerful showerhead. But the Crowne Plaza wins for its beds, as usual. You get tons of pillows. The service is good too. They were very accomodating when I wanted to change rooms because (nerd) my room didn't get the wi-fi connection. But, you know, I stayed here on the government dime at their rate of $226. But I think regularly priced rooms are around $350. I wouldn't spend what they charge just for a night here. $13 just to park. Idiots. In short, I would not reccomend staying in any hotels in New York City ever. As such, sorry, CP. You get one star. I can't reccomend any hotel that charges the rates of a NYC hotel, even in NYC.\\r Oh, and there's also big a big inflated rat out front of the hotel with a sign that says \"This hotel mistreates workers.\" Just in case you wanted to know.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Britney is one of the few stars that has ever existed that can command an entire arena, that emits spiritual and psychic positive energy through her voice and performance that has the power to change how an audience feels.  I have seen this countless times, at nightclubs: boring after boring song comes on, but when the DJ plays Britney suddenly the room erupts.  Very few performers had the ability to do this, in history.  Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland... the names on this list are surprisingly few.  However, Britney Spears is one of them.  She has the power to illuminate a room, and the World, with her work.  I am not quite sure she realizes this, she is probably far too humble, which is an integral part of  her mysterious Greatness... but I digress.\\n\\nI did not feel the staff at the Axis theater were worthy of her.  They were rude, rushed me into my seat and out of the theater just as soon as they could, and I barely had time to buy a tee- shirt.  I snuck next to the glass display to take a picture next to the \"oops\" outfit, and they practically yelled at me.  More so than anything they actually did, their demeanor was extremely GRUFF.  I can't think of a better way to put it.  Nothing exactly happened... no one slapped me in the face or kicked me in the arse... but their words were short, rude, aggravated, impatient, and unsympathetic to a fan that had traveled 5 hours that very day (from Los Angeles) to see his idol.\\n\\nI am a huge fan of Elvis as well, so we stayed at the previous Hilton where he'd performed and had a fine time touring Elvis' old dressing room. We went to 1 Oak, had a Crab Buffet, and had a mini shopping spree at the Forum Shops. But of all the fun things we did AFTER, I could not shake in the back of my mind the negative cloud of what I'd experienced at the place that drew us to Vegas to begin with.  These people need to realize how much being in that theater means to some people... it is almost a spiritual experience.  When Britney levitated from the tree during Toxic, I almost felt my soul levitate, too! \\n\\nShame on them, for poisoning such a momentous experience.  As usual, ignorant peons in the world will spoil Greatness.  But there is enough negativity in the world, a point I think Spears herself combats with her positive soul and music.  There need not be any negativity in the arena of a performer who does so much to expunge the world's ugliness, and there need not be unhappiness spread in the very Pantheon where Spears herself is employed to make us happy.  She was born to make us happy, that is her soul's purpose... so let her do so without the grumblings of those who can only think of what they are going to have for dinner after their shift is over. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nNicholas Kafantaris</td>\n",

The live music was loud and mediocre, the decor plain and dull, the food, amateurish and overly expensive for its quality, with too many heavy, goopy sauces and dressings. Pitchers of sangria were weak and full of ice, and, to top it off, the bathrooms were filthy, like a low-end club at 3am. Inexcuseable.   \n",

The lobby is nice, but the rooms are average. No microwaves. And sometimes there's a refrigerator, but it's hidden. I didn't know I had one in my room until I was about to leave one week and noticed a humming noise inside the tv cabinet, and the tv was off. The housekeeping staff tries to get on your good side by giving you little chocolates each night. The wireless connection is good everywhere but the top floor, where it comes in only in some rooms, and then it goes off and on intermittently. There's also a continental breakfast FOR THE TOP FLOOR ONLY. I don't get it at all. They don't tell you about it unless you're on the \"executive level.\" Like it's such a big deal! It's the same cereal, coffee and crappy pasteries you'll find anywhere, except worse. What a load of bullshit. TV stations are limited and seem to vary by the room (No Comedy Central sometimes). Some bathrooms have a tub, others have a big glass shower with a powerful showerhead. But the Crowne Plaza wins for its beds, as usual. You get tons of pillows. The service is good too. They were very accomodating when I wanted to change rooms because (nerd) my room didn't get the wi-fi connection. But, you know, I stayed here on the government dime at their rate of $226. But I think regularly priced rooms are around $350. I wouldn't spend what they charge just for a night here. $13 just to park. Idiots. In short, I would not reccomend staying in any hotels in New York City ever. As such, sorry, CP. You get one star. I can't reccomend any hotel that charges the rates of a NYC hotel, even in NYC.\\r Oh, and there's also big a big inflated rat out front of the hotel with a sign that says \"This hotel mistreates workers.\" Just in case you wanted to know.   \n",

Let's see, start out with a corked bottle of wine (ok could be forgivable), then a starter comes out completely cold (and meant to be hot), a dish that never arrives, French Fries with entree (again hot item that arrives COLD), and a lot of rushing the diners to \"order everything upfront so that it arrives in the right stages\" - gee - I thought that was their responsibility to manage, not ours! The menu didn't make a lot of sense, and the flavors were muddied with overly sweet, overly hot (spicy) ingredients that never balanced and basically failed.Totally unimpressive and I'm sure the tourists will love it.   \n",
       "3  Britney is one of the few stars that has ever existed that can command an entire arena, that emits spiritual and psychic positive energy through her voice and performance that has the power to change how an audience feels.  I have seen this countless times, at nightclubs: boring after boring song comes on, but when the DJ plays Britney suddenly the room erupts.  Very few performers had the ability to do this, in history.  Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland... the names on this list are surprisingly few.  However, Britney Spears is one of them.  She has the power to illuminate a room, and the World, with her work.  I am not quite sure she realizes this, she is probably far too humble, which is an integral part of  her mysterious Greatness... but I digress.\\n\\nI did not feel the staff at the Axis theater were worthy of her.  They were rude, rushed me into my seat and out of the theater just as soon as they could, and I barely had time to buy a tee- shirt.  I snuck next to the glass display to take a picture next to the \"oops\" outfit, and they practically yelled at me.  More so than anything they actually did, their demeanor was extremely GRUFF.  I can't think of a better way to put it.  Nothing exactly happened... no one slapped me in the face or kicked me in the arse... but their words were short, rude, aggravated, impatient, and unsympathetic to a fan that had traveled 5 hours that very day (from Los Angeles) to see his idol.\\n\\nI am a huge fan of Elvis as well, so we stayed at the previous Hilton where he'd performed and had a fine time touring Elvis' old dressing room. We went to 1 Oak, had a Crab Buffet, and had a mini shopping spree at the Forum Shops. But of all the fun things we did AFTER, I could not shake in the back of my mind the negative cloud of what I'd experienced at the place that drew us to Vegas to begin with.  These people need to realize how much being in that theater means to some people... it is almost a spiritual experience.  When Britney levitated from the tree during Toxic, I almost felt my soul levitate, too! \\n\\nShame on them, for poisoning such a momentous experience.  As usual, ignorant peons in the world will spoil Greatness.  But there is enough negativity in the world, a point I think Spears herself combats with her positive soul and music.  There need not be any negativity in the arena of a performer who does so much to expunge the world's ugliness, and there need not be unhappiness spread in the very Pantheon where Spears herself is employed to make us happy.  She was born to make us happy, that is her soul's purpose... so let her do so without the grumblings of those who can only think of what they are going to have for dinner after their shift is over. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nNicholas Kafantaris   \n",

After we had to take turns to share the menu, we finally decided on our entrees. 30 minutes passed, no one ever approached the table so we decided to leave. On our way out I wanted to let the hostess know that we were never greeted, after which she asked \"what table number were you at?\" How am I supposed to know? Is it a requirement to know your table number in order to get waited on?   \n",
