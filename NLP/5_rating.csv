0,19,5,5.0,"Talk about WOW. If anyone ever asked me what my favorite cookie in NYC was, it's from Levains Bakery. Coming from a person who has tried almost every dessert in this city, these cookies are out of this world. Just the right amount of gooey-crisp ratio in every bite. When you're finished, these cookies will have you on your knees begging for more. My favorite would have to be Levain's Chocolate Chip Walnut Cookie. Even though $4 may be steep to spend on only one cookie, you'll understand why after just one bite. Since Levain's has become such a popular establishment, it does get pretty busy. I would say avoid weekend lines and go during the morning or a random weekday. Even if you do end up going during their busy hours, it will be worth the wait :)",12,0.9597
1,14,3,5.0,"Mighty Quinn's is a fast-casual barbecue chain with locations across Manhattan.Calling it the Chipotle of BBQ isn't quite accurate given how brisk their delivery business seems to be versus take-out, but I'll take it for the general ""high quality, low price point, good enough"" level that most locations seem to put out. The food stands up pretty well to delivery, and if you're getting it from the comfort of Seamless, I predict an average to positive experience. But if you're willing to make the trek to East Village flagship, which apparently makes the food for the other locations, you can find some truly standout barbecue.I first ventured here via Jane D's suggestion to try the ribs. These are probably their best: tender, just short of fall-off-the-bone, and not at all greasy. The pulled pork is also exceptional-- a fattier blend than typical, resulting in a sloppy and gluttonous sandwich, cut with crisp cucumbers and sharp pickled red onions.Other meat (brisket, chicken) has been high quality but on the dry side. Their barbecue sauce isn't anything out of the ordinary, but it's satisfying and works with all of their options. I haven't explored the sides too much yet, being a small human typically sated with their single-portion meat serving. The kale salad is pretty average; the sweet potatoes are splendid.Prices are good; I typically spend under $15 here including tax and tip. Service varies in terms of attitude but it's always efficient. There's a bathroom with a lock code.Overall, I found the meat here to be better than expected given the corporate vibe and mass production. A reliable pick for NYC barbecue and an increasing part of my diet.",21,0.9945

This restaurant is kind of small , not to many tables so be aware that if you are coming during the weekend the lines will be long !! the wait time will be more than 30 minutes ! The menu is not long but it's exactly what you need for this kind of Restaurant , hamburgers, drinks and shakes ! The service was very fast ! . We started with drinks, One Mule and one beer. You can choose between draft , can or bottle beer. Drinks !1- Mule - Tito's Vodka! 4 of 5 , It's good but is very light ! Bartender ! please!! pour more vodka! lol 2- Jalapeño Margarita - 5 of 5 !

3,18,7,5.0,"Did I just eat THE burger in New York City? The double stack burger was absolute perfection on a plate! It had that ""umami"" factor and albeit steep price, it just felt so satisfying to bite into it.There was dimension and tons of flavor. I loved the sauteed onions, the sweet bun, and pickles. The overall flavor was just very memorable. I was eating it unmodified and just the way they usually serve it and it was satisfying and I did not finish it - so portion is great for the price! (At least for me).I would love to come back for the pizza, and definitely could see myself coming back here in general. Service was good - my only pet peeve was that our group of 9 all ordered burgers and it took a very long time to get all of them out. Some of us felt too awkward to eat ours (it was a corporate lunch), and waiting made things soggy.",14,0.9867
4,14,6,5.0,"So places like this really do exist.Like many of us, I grew up romanticizing New York. I watched Saturday Night Fever and Desperately Seeking Susan and Goodfellas and most importantly, Sex in the City (and like many of us, was probably far too young for the content at the time). I saw a swanky, luxurious life filled with unthinkable embellishments. Then I moved here and realized that there's a thing called rent and another thing called student loans and another thing called taxes and I started to resent Carrie Bradshaw and her ridiculous and impossible apartment. Well, I digress. That world of splendor I pined for with every cell of my being does exist--albeit on a different scale--at Manhatta. It starts from the moment you walk in: a well-groomed host in the lobby leads you to an elevator that makes one stop only: Floor 60. You float up into paradise, into a world where people bring you things you didn't know you wanted and you can pretend for a night that this is the norm now, that you while always dine amongst the stars...Manhatta has done a magical thing: it manages to perfectly package Ideal Manhattan Experience. This is a place for a special occasion. A sweeping dining room bound by floor-to-ceiling windows that look out on the entire city. With a prix fixe-only menu, timing is executed perfectly and servers twirl in with your next course just as you start thinking you'd like to move to the next thing. It's seasonal, refined American fare with a top-notch mixology program as well. We did something very out of the ordinary for me, which is drop in to a very popular venue without a reservation. I never heed the whole ""we accept walk-ins at our bar / full dinner menu"", but this past Saturday, I the fire in my belly was strong enough. As if this place wasn't already magical enough, we exited the elevator and found ourselves staring at two empty seats at the bar. Dream it and believe it, friends.Perhaps the view wasn't *quite* as spectacular sitting at the bar, but we had an added bonus of watching our bartender fix up some fantastic drinks. We both stuck with cocktails here despite the impressive wine list, and I'm glad we did. The drink menu changes frequently so sadly I can't report much of what we had, but I can speak to two on the current online menu: the Castle Garden (Gin, Benedictine, Honey, Lime, Angostura) the Manhatta (New York Distilling Ragtime Rye, Punt e Mes, Lustau East India Sherry, Bitters). Both well-executed a yummy. My favorite drink of the night was a stirred vodka cocktail brand new to the menu. I don't like vodka so the idea of a *stirred* vodka drink sounds awful at first, but the bartender convinced me as a fellow vodka-disenthusiast. It's worth your time. We came during Valentine's Day weekend (the actual day was 2/16) so the bar was offering its usual a la carte menu (most dishes are totally different than the tasting menu) as well as a four-course meal for $188. Pretty steep considering their three-courser is $88, but the dishes looked so good, we couldn't pass it up. That's the last time we ball out for a while, but it was worth it. Our eats, below:Citrus Salad w/ Labneh, Roasted Beets & Hazelnut: ALight and refreshing, sophisticated an elegant. The ideal first course, kind of served as an amuse bouche. Great use of both texture and flavor.Lobster Quenelle w/ Mushrooms & Roasted Lobster Emulsion: A+Oh man, this is where it started to get decadent. I had never heard of this particular lobster preparation before but it was just divine. Rich and warming, lobster two-ways is luxurious and comforting, very unique.Soft Scrambled Eggs w/ Uni: AI had a similar preparation once at a restaurant in Philly which was out of this world, so everything else pales in comparison. So this didn't blow me away given the reference I had, but it's still delicious. Rich and creamy, you'll want to take a bath in it. Foie Gras: AMore luxury, in the form of liver. Served with some sort of mustard and maybe some sort of kraut (this isn't on the online menu so I'm doing my best), all components meshed well.Bites, compliments of the kitchen, brought out during our first course:Chicken Liver Mousse w/ Everything Bagel Seasoning: A+ Eat this with bread, eat this plain, delicacy after delicacy will greet you here.Oysters: A+Can't remember the accompaniments but these were fresh and delicious, a nice interlude before the rest of the meal.Crescent Duck w/ Offal Sausage, Confit, Endive & Prunes: A+Cooked perfectly, a beautiful winter entree. Rich, subtle sweet-and-savory melody going on, served in some yummy sauce and punctuated with candied nuts and more citrus.Wagyu Coulotte w/ Mushrooms, Celeriac, Turnips & Beet Jus: A+Another beautifully seasonal dish, excellent cook on the meat. I almost never eat red meat but our meal and Manhatta proved to be an ideal opportunity to splurge (though I do feel I'll need a steady diet of veggies and quinoa for the next week as a result).",15,0.9995
5,14,5,5.0,"Visited Yara's based on the recommendation of a friend and I'm glad I did. Upon entering we were greeted by a friendly hostess but that was just the beginning of our great experience. The next thing that caught our attention was the decor and ambience, it was obvious that attention was paid to every detail, the place is gorgeous!After being sat we were greeted by a friendly waitress who took our appetizer and drink orders, not too long after, the Chef came to our table to greet us and give us some recommendations for our entrees. I ended up choosing the mixed grill platter and my date chose the Salmon which was the catch of the day. While waiting for our order, Jacob (the owner) came by our table to check on how things were going. He was very pleasant, funny and welcoming. Our food came out fairly quickly and as soon as we dug into each of our dishes, we were blown away by the wonderful flavors. Their Salmon is THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD IN NEW YORK!!! Yeah I said it! It was F'N AMAZING!! It was so good I suggested that they make it a permanent item on the menu. The mixed grill platter was also great but that Salmon...GEEEEZ!!! Both dishes were served with mixed veggies and rice. Don't forget to ask for a side of Toum(Lebanese Garlic Sauce).Yara has GREAT potential and I definitely see it taking off and becoming one of the ""it"" spots in the city. I can't wait to go back and explore the rest of the menu.",15,0.998
6,16,16,5.0,"LOOK, when I first heard about ""Sleep No More,"" I thought that it sounded like a terrible high school art project. An ""interactive"" 20th-century version of MacBeth with no dialogue where you just roam around the set and wait for things to happen? I was wrong. This is the best show in NYC, and if you are visiting, I recommend it immensely. And I typically have no truck for avant-garde stuff, can't really understand performed dance, and am a cultural aesthetic simpleton whose favorite movies are Legally Blonde and Miss Congeniality. But I was mesmerized by this thing. The set design is unreal, and so are the performances. I've never seen anything like it. In the decades to come, as AI ascends, we will be intensely debating the question: ""What makes humans truly human?"" Well, let me tell you something: it's creations like Sleep No More, testaments to human creativity stretched to their absolute maximum bounds. Good, golly, WOW!The only thing I suggest to the producers is they've got to do something about pushy audience members who think it's OK to just shove other people aside. NO! This kind of unwanted behavior should be halted by the various black masked ""security"" personnel. I'm also going to add that handholding should be banned because it slows down the flow of foot traffic and causes bottlenecks. Even though they recommend you explore this individually, certain couples here can't psychologically afford to let go for even 2-3 hours. I believe there are two things at work: alarming co-dependency, or worse, the ""man"" who feels he has to ""protect"" his partner and can't let her go. I've seen both, and neither bodes well for long-term relationship dynamics.",21,0.8761
7,16,12,5.0,"There's something special about their macarons. Unique flavors and combinations, they really are top notch. I absolutely love the key lime pie ice cream macaron sandwich, which is sweet and tart, a piece of heaven in each bite. It seems as they always have something new here, sweets from wall to wall. You really can't go wrong. They even have an early grey tea macaron! And guess what, all of the products sold here is plant based. Reasonably priced for NY macarons, and delectable to boot. I'm a yuge fan and I'm sure you will be too.",14,0.9828
8,35,14,5.0,"The Bronx zoo is a great way to spend a Wednesday. Why Wednesday ? because it's by donations ^.^. They also have seasonal events that can be fun for the family and young ones. For Easter they had an egg scavenger hunt , a birdathon coming up in may and a garden event by farm on now in June. On top of that they have a 4-D theater with built in sensory effects, my niece loved it so much the first five minutes and then she fell asleep from fatigue. One of her favorite things to do was the bug carousel she choose to ride on top of the firefly. Now the coolest thing ever that I discovered during my visit was the NATURETREK! I actually did it with my niece cause I'm a kid at heart and I did not have this as a child lol. The naturetrek was my favorite it was very cool navigating through bridges balancing beams and weaves between obstacles. it was very impressive to see how well this was built. The Bronx zoo also has sea lions and penguins feedings where you can watch them. Now in the children's zoo section you can actually feed the animal yourself where you can dispense pellets from a quarter machine to feed the sheep, goats and donkeys. They also have camel rides from those who want to ride we skip that part. We got the total experience and the camel ride was not included but it did include a lot such as the butterfly garden, children's zoo, Congo gorilla forest , jungle world , 4D Theater , bug carousel , wild Asia monorail and zoo shuttle the prices for an Adult is 37$ and kids 3 and up 27$ . Overall a very fun experience",37,0.9589
9,10,4,5.0,"Cup & Cup is my new favorite lunch spot in the Herald Square area! (...Okay, it's a few minutes walk from Herald Square but close enough). Ambiance-wise it's more of a cafe than a restaurant, but they serve up some great food AND it's very affordable. You can order a rice or noodle dish for $7.50, or choose from a combo:- $8.50 for a dish + a drink (less than $3)- $10 for a dish + a drink (over $3)- $10 for two dishes + a side + a drink (only downside to this option is that the dishes are pre-picked for you)I've tried the karaage, California rice, and Japanese curry rice bowls and loved them all. The portion size is perfect for lunch - the karaage bowl was especially filling, though the Japanese curry one could've used more curry and croquette relative to the amount of rice. If I'm in a splurge-y mood then I usually get an iced green tea latte along with my meal, which is also excellent.The baristas/cashiers are consistently friendly, and there is always ample seating available and mellow/indie music playing in the background. I've never had to wait too long for my food during lunchtime either (the longest was probably 10 minutes). My only gripe about this place is that they're cash only, but everything comes out to a conveniently even amount ($10, $7.50, etc) that even this is only a minor issue. Overall, I highly recommend Cup & Cup for lunch!",17,0.9823
10,10,8,5.0,"FINALLY tried the Khao Soi and Chili-rubbed spare ribs and they are AMAZING.The Khao Soi is a delicious combination of sous vide chicken, soft-boiled egg half, pineapple slices (NOT canned), and crispy and soft egg noodles in the best coconut curry broth. The egg noodles are perfect - soft, chewy, and a great vehicle for the broth. I literally picked up the huge bowl and drank the remaining broth it is that good! If they ever decide to do a Khao Soi challenge, een if it is 10 pounds, sign me up!The ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender and so flavorful! You also get 3 HUGE ribs with a side of coleslaw that is creamy, sweet, and savory with an Asian kick. The entire dish is drool-worthy.The pad see yew was also very good with plenty of egg, chicken, Chinese broccoli, and perfectly tender flat rice noodles in a slightly spicy and savory sauce.They also gave us a complimentary sesame cake dessert for NYE and it was superb. The cake is fluffy yet dense with just the right amount of sweetness and perfectly complimented by the scoop of creamy Vanilla ice cream. Honestly, the dishes here are better than the equivalent versions at the best Thai and SE Asian places in the city. The menu is small but meticulously crafted and every item is delicious. The staff are fantastic (among the best service I have had) and the seating is low-key and comfortable. Plus the playlist is great!Just come here now. Seriously. It's worth the trip and walking is great exercise, just in time for New Year's resolutions (and it's super close to the 6 btw).",18,0.9967

13,13,6,5.0,"Having been to the FiDi location when I used to live down there, I was hyped to see this location under construction while walking around work.  My two coworkers and I visited the second day after they opened for lunch and I am extremely happy to report that the sandwiches here are just as good as I remembered!The counter attendants were welcoming and cheerful, open to giving you their own personal favorites and suggestions if you are overwhelmed by the long list of options. We tried the Parma (prosciutto, smoked mozz, sundried tomatoes, arugula), Bari (salami, fresh mozz, olive paste, sundried tomatoes), and Trieste (proscuitto, fresh mozz, balsamic dressing, arugula) and enjoyed all of them. You can choose the bread you prefer; I'm a big fan of the focaccia (+$1.50) but the ciabatta (+$1.00) is also perfection. The ingredients are very fresh and high quality, and I can die happy after eating the sundried tomato + olive paste combo. There is also a good selection of vegetarian options, and another one of my coworkers tried the Capri (bufala mozz, fresh tomatoes, arugula, e.v.o.o.) on semolina (+$1.00). The verdict was ""v good sandwich. *heart* buffalo mozz and the semolina is *italian chef kissing fingers*"" I was also told to emphasize that you can taste that its real EVOO and not some cheap knockoff. The sandwich sizes here are absurdly massive. Ask them to cut your sandwich into 4's so you can save some for a snack / dinner. Alternatively, life is too short for regret so choose your own adventure and eat as much as you want in one sitting (me).There is a $10 credit card minimum, but nearly all the sandwiches will allow you to meet that minimum. COME HERE but also don't make the line too long kthxbye.",18,0.9932
14,12,6,5.0,"I got tickets to climb the Vessel at the Hudson Yards on the 2nd day of the grand opening weekend. The process of getting tickets is simple, you just go to the website and claim your spot in a virtual queue. You can enter your email address, and the system will contact you when it is your turn to reserve your tickets; however, you will only have 10 minutes to do so before your lose your spot in the queue. You can reserve up to 6 tickets at a time, and they release same day tickets everyday at 8am.The Vessel is a honeycomb-like structure that is about 16 stories tall and consists of 154 flights of stairs. However, the stairs are pretty easy to climb and my friend and I did not feel tired at all. There is an elevator, but it was not in operation when we visited on the 2nd day of the opening weekend. There's a view at every level, and it is really cool to see the water view of the Hudson River coastline when you are at the top. I would recommend going later, so you could see the sunset. The most convenient way to get to the Hudson Yards is by taking the 7 train to the 34th Street-Hudson Yards station. The station is literally right next to the Vessel and the shopping mall.",19,0.9288

It's affordable and delicious. The wait staff was really easy going and helpful with recommendations. My cousins and I came here for a small birthday celebration. We reserved a table for 5:30 on Monday. Around 6:30, the back area of the restaurant ""the greenhouse"" was packed. It has a cool garden area feel and colorful lamps. The decor is really interesting here. The menu is quite overwhelming with so many options to choose from. For appetizers, we ordered the Bruschette: Peperoni Rossi con Caprino. The waiter said ""they call this ""peasant bread."" It was topped with marinated grilled peppers and goat cheese. The goat cheese overpowered the whole dish, but it was still really good. Along with this Bruschette, we also ordered the Pomodoro E Basilico. My cousin said the bread was a tad soggy from all the Tomato Basil and olive oil, but I thought it was fine. We also ordered the Three-Cheese Course which comes with baked focaccia crisps. The three cheeses we chose were Cheddar, Manchego, Chevre Rondin. The Chevre Rondin was my favorite.. I've become a huge fan of goat cheese after coming here. For entrees, we ordered two pies: Pizza Margherita (regular pizza). We also ordered Lasagna Al Pesto and Lasagna Quattro Formaggi along with a panini: Tacchino Affumicato & Prosciutto Arrostito. The panini was very filling and it would make for either a nice lunch or dinner. The Lasagna was very well made. The four kinds of cheese in Lasagna Quattro Formaggi was very filling and perfect for a cheese lover. Overall, I would definitely come back for lunch or dinner.",25,0.9933

Today was a particularly amazing day for it beacuse I dropped in and the weather was warm. The service here is always so friendly on top of everything. Your always greeted with a smile. Just walking into this place takes you back to childhood.So I got 4 flavors beacuse with so many choices, you just can't get one! I actually started out with pistachio, then thought it was a good idea to add on tiramisu beacuse, why wouldn't I? Then it esculated to hazelnut and a burbon flavor. When they asked me if I wanted the little macaroon on top.. My only reply was.. Pistachio please! I sat down and begun to eat. As I ate, I actually realized that I probably got alittle too much and probably could have opted for a smaller size, but you only live once, so why not.

22,35,18,5.0,"We thought we liked our fried fish place down in Gun Hill. Now I'm thinking- we've been doing it all wrong. But when Harbour appeared on the Hot & New Restaurants in Mamaroneck, you know it was on my list! Idea came from hubby and suggested we have Lunch here. Mind you, we even talked- not too long ago about how much White Plains and other nearby towns were in dire need of a Fried Fish place.I actually noticed them 'Closed' on their Yelp page, but I Googled and called them anyway. Sure enough, person I spoke to over the phone was energetic- so we went! Located a block away from E. Boston Post Road and the Mamaroneck Harbor, Harbour Fish is a fantastic addition to the area. Quiane, her Mom and Harbour's chef- hailing from the City Island strip- are bringing something wayyyyyy different from the typical and bland fish fry places we've all came to enjoy at one time or another especially if you lived in The BX, BK, QNS, NYC. Few things to know...(1) They're closed on Sundays. But given the weather was nice and it was Super Bowl Sunday, she wanted to test the waters and see what the foot traffic was like. (2) Harbour isn't sit-down. They're only Take out. However...was told when weather gets nice, there will be some outside seating. We were impressed. Harbour has their friers and counter space on left wall. They offer fresh Seafood up front, followed by more counter space and raw Veggies for their Steamed or Boiled dishes. Hubby went all in with Whiting Fried Fish Sandwich+Tartar Sauce on the side, 8-piece Jumbo Fried Shrimp to share and Cod Fried Fish Sandwich sans Chipotle Mayo for me. At this point, I'm like all over Harbour and prices are fair I thought. After that, I just wanted to get home and chow down! The food you wanna know??? Shrimp and Fish aren't just Fried. Quiane and her chef use the perfect amount of a real slamming and seasony dredge on all their Fried Seafood. And it shows they take pride in what they're putting out- and that's fresh Seafood and a damn good Fish Fry. Everything was very, very good and definitely the BEST Fried Fish Sandwich and Seafood I've had in a long time! The name says it all...I need to make plans to return!",34,0.9973
23,21,8,5.0,"I was kind of afraid that this place would be just another solid, not outstanding, overpriced token ethnic cuisine spot in New York. You know what I mean - there are so many, and most aren't really worth checking out.I was very pleasantly surprised by Mari Vanna. Firstly, the interior was GORGEOUS. Photos don't do it justice. It's beautiful, slightly kitschy and twee, and feels like it might have come out of the manor of a lesser noble in St. Petersburg (I've been). The decor is a refreshing change from the standard ultra modern/trendy ambiance of most NYC establishments, and is worth the trip alone.Luckily, the food is delicious as well! Dinner is probably pricier, but at lunch they serve a $25 prix fixe that includes a hefty appetizer and entree which is a great deal. We ordered the salmon salad, herring (yum if you like raw fish), chicken stroganoff, and beef pelmeni. Portions and quality were good and quite tasty. I confess that I am generally a huge fan of Eastern European food - meat, smoked fish and potatoes, what's not to like? For lunch, I also enjoyed the food and ambiance much more than Veselka (more of a diner) and find both establishments to be similarly priced, in which case Mari Vanna is the clear winner.I read some reviews stating that service was bad, but during lunch the servers were very friendly and responsive.Worth the trip!",19,0.9907
24,16,6,5.0,"I would like to review this restaurant as a vegetarian / vegan restaurant, rather than just a Korean Restaurant. So, please consider this when you are thinking about this restaurant.1. Reservations - Make a reservation. You will have to call into the restaurant to make one, but be sure to make one.2. The ambiance - Amazing. Dark, woody, balanced with some kind of perfect otherness to it that is for me not easy to describe, other than to tell you that I felt so comfortable here.3. Lose the Shoes - UYes, you will be sitting in a traditional Korean Dining space with a low table. But, thankfully, there is a recessed cavity for you to put your feet into, so you won't have to sit crossed legged for the whole dinner. For me, that would have been a problem as my legs would have gone to sleep.4. The food. Amazing vegetarian food with a Korean flair.a. Spicy Baby Dumplings, I ate this too fast to figure out what vegetables were in this, but they were excellent. Kind of like a ravioli or a wonton with a unique taste.b. Combination pancakes which were leek pancakes, kimchi mushroom and kabocha pumpkin pancakes. All very good. The kimchi mushroom was my favorite.c. Todok Stone Bowl rice - I never had todok before, but wanted to try this on the recommendation of the waiter. Todok is a Korean mountain root and it was delicious! This was to me a unique and tasty bibimbap with the todok root. Very Nice.d. Tofu with mixed vegetables - My friend ordered this and enjoyed it. It does not come with rice separately so you have to order a side of rice to really enjoy this!e. Kimchi Stone Bowl Rice - This is also to me like bibimbap in a stone bowl with Kimchi. Excellent. What I like most about these stone bowls is that the bowls are so hot, that the rice continues to cook and gets that crispy fried texture as if it was on the bottom of a cooked pan. Tasty, great texture and fun to scrape and eat it!f. Avocado Stone Bowl rice- The avocado added a very creamy and rich texture to the meal. Very nice.Not sure why we all ended up with Rice Bowls, I wanted us to try the other items like the Mushrooms, but the waiter highly recommended the stone bowls and so for some odd reason, most of the party ordered it.For Dessert, we had the chocolate mocha cake, with a scoop of soy vanilla ice cream, blueberry coconut cake , and two mango sorbets. Excellent and extremely tasty.As a vegetarian / vegan restaurant, the food here is absolutely outstanding. The presentation, the taste, the choice, the beauty of the creations are top notch. Loved it. For a Korean restaurant, since I am not a vegan or vegetarian, I did miss the great taste of meats cooked so well, but Hangawi was a very unique experience that I am so happy to have tried and will try again in the future.GK says, check it out. Especially if your daughter is vegan and is in NYC for the first time!",17,0.9993

And the jpgs were stored in folders that corresponded to the negatives index. Images turned out great.

26,11,7,5.0,"Just opened 4 weeks ago today, and while RH rooftop enjoyed peace and quiet - the words out now!Located within the jaw dropping new RH in Meatpacking, on the 5th floor is the gorgeous RH Rooftop Restaurant. Decked out in plush seating, chandeliers for days, and a rooftop with #views, you need to get here STAT. Like their sister resto in Chicago, they do not take ressies. We arrived just after opening (10am) and the place was empty! Left around 12 and it was still only half full. Go NOW!Of course besides the aesthetics - the food was on point and excellent pricing for the environment. I had the divine eggs w/ creme fraiche, served alongside the most decadent and delicious buttered toast ($18). Friend had the burger ($24) and it was massive! Didn't try it but was told it was excellent. Hubby got the turkey club which was a very generous portion. All the plates come with sides - either fries or side salad and lemme tell you - fries all the way! One of the best fries I've had and I'm a French fry expert so basically just trust me. Service was top notch and the bathrooms here, oh myyyy. Dripping in marble and gold. The ambiance here is certainly RH worthy and the food was delish to boot. Would 200% return!",13,0.9933

28,14,14,5.0,"By far the best omakase in New York City. World renowned sushi chef Tatsu is the best in the game, in my opinion, and thankfully he is in the heart of Greenwich Village. Located downstairs Le Boucherie, on Christopher street, there are only 12 seats and 4 employees. And it's all they need. Beware of the brightness of light, k8 and I had go back to The Terraces to grab sunglasses when we went the first time. But if you expect an authentic Japanese sushi omakase, then this place is perfect. No music, brightly lit and the theater of sushi. You won't believe the service and hospitality; I never had an empty glass and returning to my seat at the sushi bar (there are no tables) my napkin is delicately folded and waiting for me. We first went on an anniversary and we were gifted a book about Tatsu. I wish I had a book about me to give people when they came to my sushi restaurant, but I do not have a sushi restaurant, nor am I a sushi chef, nor do I have a book - so I just give people my fake music album on audio compact disc when they bring their own sushi to my standup shows.K8 has mentioned the toothpicks in the bathroom every time we go, so don't miss out on that. I just can't say enough good things about the sushi, so I won't say anything at all for fear of using my entire vocabulary up in one yelp review and not being able to speak in public which is largely what I do for a living. For me, this is the crown jewel of Japanese food in New York City. Tatsu is humble, brilliant, inventive and funny- his associates are every bit as talented and essential. His assistant won't make eye contact much but your eyes will roll back into your head when you taste the miso soup he prepares, the best I have ever had. The final piece, not tamago, is something so delicately prepared and delicious that it is at once a delicacy I have never encountered and reminiscent of the nostalgia of a childhood tunafish sandwich. I have never had prawn sushi that rivals Tatsu's.At $145 it is expensive but yet a steal, plan on paying for additional pieces if you go hungry, we usually eat a final hand roll (after my second prawn piece) as our dessert. I plan to come here every week I am in town so I'll see you there, I'll be the one at the end of the bar trying not to fall out of my chair from satiation next to k8 who will be hovering several inches off her seat because of the ambrosia. It's TatSupreme to the maximum.The original yelp gangster,T.J. Miller",17,0.9897
29,14,6,5.0,"THIS WARM BOWL OF FOOD MADE YOUR GIRL SO HAPPY.Hashtag new year resolution but I could not stand another sa(la)d from sweetgreen, so hello poke. Hashtag January in NYC and I needed some hot food in my stomach, so hello Red Poke. This place has been on my radar for a while and I know they are Korean-owned which makes it ultra appealing to me not only because the food must be flavorful by definition but also I have the civil duty to support POC businesses. Plus, I live literally across the street.The customer service is amazing and the guy running the cash register was super patient and helpful. People assembling the bowls were fast and everyone communicated well. I got a large with tofu, shrimp and salmon and all three proteins tasted fantastic. They also have like 10 different sauces to choose from so TAKE THAT, OTHER POKE JOINTS. The rice (both white and brown) is extremely moist just as you would expect from our Korean fam out there. A few things of note:1. I would probably not get the japchae again because I find it quite flavorless. I guess you are supposed to mix it with a lot of sauce but I didn't dig it.2. The rice is kept warm in the rice cooker which is genius especially for the winter but it means that the white rice is not sushi rice (with vinegar and all that).3. They forgot to give me kimchi which you have to pay extra for. Nonetheless I was satiated because they give you a healthy amount of each topping you choose.4. The supergreens is really just spinach at least on my visit.5. The avocado is stored as a mash in a container (instead of being scooped out to order). Not necessarily a bad thing because I've seen some darn black avocado halves at salad joints, just as an FYI.To be fair my experience was really a 4 but my delicious bowl got my hopes up and I am convinced this place might actually be perfect. I cannot wait to try their dumplings and sides and fully stamp my loyalty card!",12,0.9968
30,15,7,5.0,"What an epic meal. The theme here is ENJOY. The whole space has that warm, spacious, brewery-style feeling that only comes from the Midwest, where this spot hails from. These two dishes are the incredible must-gets:1: the fried chicken packed with ginger and crunchy sesame in a Korean sauce: my surprising favorite, divine! 2: their signature cheeseburger with bacon and egg, oozing with yolk and thick-cut bacon All the food here is so well balanced: they're working with hugely flavorful foods and, somehow, combining them into something harmonious and not too salted, or too cheesy, or too this or that. Such a feat! We happened to unknowingly sit next to Brandon, the sous chef, at the counter and he offered us a free dish of bone marrow, piled high and with their warm beef cheek jam. Wowsa, was this delicious. Brandon was so kind and generous and filled us in on how excited they are to finally open the doors to their NYC location. Our server Jorge was also great and welcoming and urged us to take our time and enjoy.5 stars!!!!!!!",19,0.9935
31,14,5,5.0,"KenScale: 9.0/10Around this time of the year, I usually have one or two favorite restaurants in NYC in my mind (my annual review will come out shortly). 2018 thus far has been a strange year in that regard; it was quite difficult to pinpoint any memorable moments throughout the culinary journey with my wife Jun. Until my recent birthday dinner with my wife Jun. Anyone who follows my reviews will know that as a native Korean, I can be pretty difficult to please when it comes to Korean restaurants in the city. After much deliberation on where I will celebrate my 35th birthday with Jun, I ultimately decided on Atomix and purchased tickets for two (at $175 per person). It turned out that Atomix is the best Korean restaurant I had been to in New York City. It also turned out that Atomix is the best new restaurant in NYC that I had visited this year. What distinguishes Atomix from other fine-dining tasting menu places is the efforts that the restaurant has put into explaining the background behind each dish in its ten-course offering. I have never come across a restaurant that has a flashcard describing the inspiration for each dish, and this narrative element greatly adds to the tasting experience itself. And each dish actually delivered with such astounding elegance. Let's start out with ""guk"" (soup in Korean); with the ""maesaengi"" seaweed in the pork broth along with garlic custard and sea urchin from Hokkaido, the soup became one harmonious bowl that was aromatic and delicious. Atomix's brilliance lies in the way the kitchen uses unexpected ingredients in the way I had not expected in Korean cuisine, such as carrot that was fermented to give yellow sashimi (""hwe"") such a refreshing kick. As described in the flashcard, potato pancake (""jeon"") has not been considered peasant food given the low place of potato in the grain hierarchy of Korean tradition, but Atomix has found a way to elevate it into a beautiful slice with ricotta cheese and a variety of flower and herb that was also delightfully crispy. Other dishes such as steamed snow crab ""jjim"" with white kimchi sauce, pickled grenada pepper and smoked trout roe, fried (""twigim"") soondae and a tart of celeriac, buttermilk cheese, hazelnut milk and caviar (""sukchae"") similarly displayed ingenuity and thoughtful execution. Our two best savory dishes came at the end. The grilled (""gui"") golden eye snapper that came with kohlrabi (compressed with white kimchi juice) and nuruk (a traditional fermentation starter) sauce using snapper fish stock was so delicious that I had a hard time thinking of any other fish dish I had at a restaurant recently that was just as memorable. Similarly the braised (""jorim"") wagyu was a marvelous perfection in texture. You will see an assortment of rice and lettuce with which you can make small wraps along with this beautiful meat accompanied by fermented red pepper. Each bite of wrap was just blissful, and my only regret was that there were only four pieces of meat. he two desserts that came out were also fascinating. I didn't expect to see ice cream made of makgeolli, but it sure was a delightful palate cleanser (""ipgasim"") and I began to wonder why other restaurants have not thought of using this popular rice wine for desserts. The main dessert (""husik"") consisting of red bean, crème fraiche, persimmon and pine nut drew influence from winter solstice (on which Koreans eat red bean porridge (""patjuk"")), and beautifully captured the modern interpretation of patjuk with the addition of persimmon that was aged with soju (another popular Korean liquor) then roasted to give a smooth texture. As noted above, reservations at Atomix can only be secured through ticket purchases (one for 6 p.m. and the other for 9 p.m. each day) online (available at Tock). The intimate single chef's counter setting at the restaurant gives a modern yet unpretentious feel that is another positive contributor to the dining experience. Occasionally chef Park comes out to serve a dish himself, and his wife Ms. Park walks around the counter making sure all the diners are properly attended to. There is full bar with cocktails inspired by modern Korean flavors and ingredients as well as a wine list mostly from France, Italy and U.S. At the end of our meal, Jun and I took a photo with chef Park and briefly spoke to Ms. Park, who noted that the menu changes every quarter, thereby giving me a revelation that Jun and I should visit this place whenever the menu is revamped so we so we get to see what kind of magic chef Park's kitchen brings forward, while also as a fellow native Korean hopefully giving more moral support to this mild-mannered yet ambitious Korean couple. In fact, while our culinary journey has been mostly checking out new restaurants as they open, we have decided that we will pick a few go-to restaurants that we will want to visit more than twice every year. Atomix will be the first restaurant on that list.",20,0.9991

33,21,11,5.0,"""Listen, it's Sunday and it's past my bedtime,"" I said, my voice wavering and becoming less resolute as Joshua (the bowtie-clad host who gracefully also bartends, spouts sake facts, and jokes -- the good kind) dangled an appetizing cocktail menu under our gazing eyes. Yes, I stayed up past my bedtime to write about this place, because it was that good. Everything about Sushi by Boū says: ""Come in, relax, don't worry about a thing.""Upon arriving, we had waited in the hotel lobby with sexy bachata music wafting from the speakers. We received plastic key cards to the hotel suite. The menu was tucked into the hotel card sleeve. The key card opens the suite room door, and Joshua kindly took our coats as our evening began. Interestingly, I had just attended an immersive theatre experience the night before, and I feel like Sushi By Boū nailed it. I love the way the hotel room creates a ""cleansing"" moment - the moment you hear the whirring of the lock opening- the moment that notifies you that you are about to be taken into another world. It's not the run-of-the-mill jazz background music. The music is hip and alive. And the second you sit down at the four seat sushi bar, you know it's going to be a show. Our chef for the night, Ashi, was serious and got down to business; as the night went on we got to coax his winning smile out more than once. He is mesmerizing to watch, his hands flying yet so precise. We knew we had one hour for the $125 omakase menu: 17 pieces. It was one of those experiences that simultaneously flew by because of how orgasmic every bite was, but also seemed to stretch out for a pleasing amount of time because of the atmosphere. The lighting and decor are careful to keep you ""in"" the experience. I sort of love the timed omakase experience because you're never left wondering for 15 minutes when your next piece is coming. It's right there, in front of you. My favorite pieces of night included the sea scallop (uuuuh), the uni (uuuuuuuuuh), and the toro (uuuuuuuuuuuuh). Ashi's eyes lit up when I moaned at the sea scallop because, I mean, it was his favorite too. Unbelievably fresh. This is about making sushi your new boo (bou). This is about bringing the knowledge and experience of authentic, fresh Japanese style sushi (not your caterpillar or California rolls, okay) to the world. I'm amazed at the intimacy they achieve while being open to banter and lightheartedness. It's so refreshing, and, hot tip, the summertime's gonna be fresh with their new patio bar. So line your Resy up for that date. I'll see you there, room service and all. I'll even stay up past my bedtime for it. After all, you uni live once.",17,0.9954

A non-invasive, non-surgical procedure that effortlessly builds muscles in your abs and butt. The machine is FDA-approved and it is safe. It claims to do about 20,000 sit-ups for you in 30 minutes time, resulting in about 16-20% increase in muscle and 16-20% decrease in fat in the abdominal region.I signed up for the EmScuplt ab sessions, which consist of 4 sessions in a 2 week period, with 2-3 days in between sessions. Each session lasted for 30 minutes. I was able to go to yoga and kickboxing after each session easily. There's two paddles so you can bring a friend to do an ab session together. The wait varies.

53,21,12,5.0,"What makes this Chinese restaurant unique out of the hundreds and hundreds of Chinese restaurants you walk past around every block you can imagine in NYC? It's authentic. Not your Americanized General Tso's Chicken and Pork Fried Rice, but real Chinese food, Sichuan to be exact.I got to try various items on the menu during my visit here. A few items that really stood out to me:Pork Rib Soup w. Lotus Root - Would recommend this instead of the usual Wonton Soup found typically at a Chinese restaurant as this is something more authentic. Pork ribs is something to die for in this dish.Some of the appetizers I liked: Dan Dan Noodles and Sichuan Spicy DumplingsEggplant with Garlic Sauce - stirred fried eggplant drenched in a garlic sauce which is also a little bit sweet which adds a nice taste to it.Sauteed String Beans - If you want a vegetable dish that is not spicy and soaked in sauce, I'd recommend this. I'd get this with pork added to the mix if you're looking to add meat to it.Spicy Aromatic Baked Whole Fish - most likely my favorite which has that hint of spicy with a sweet tangy flavor that goes really well together with the fish itself.",23,0.9709
54,29,13,5.0,"If you're from New York or just visiting you need to catch a show at Radio City. The theatre is beautiful and it's very big inside. What I love about is that it's well organized and has the lobby has just enough items up for purchase (not too little not too much) it is over priced (think of movie theater popcorn prices).We go every year to catch the Rockettes and my now 7 yo loves to watch the whole Christmas story they play. We have sat in a variety of seats so I can say if you're with kids sit on the 1st mezzanine mainly because of the way it's angled it easier for them to see what's happening. Orchestra seats are great for adults but not so much for kids. The other pit about sitting really close is you don't get to see the whole show in a single view, where if you're sitting a little bit higher you can watch the show a little more easily. The pit about being higher though is it's not as shiney as it is from below the glitter and gold shine a little brighter from orchestra seats ;) also it seems a little more loud from higher up.",26,0.9564
55,24,12,5.0,"I had the ultimate pleasure of being gifted tickets to watch one of the first productions of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' during December 2018. The cast is phenomenal, including Jeff Daniels in the lead, Dakin Matthews, Neal Huff, and LaTanya Richardson Jackson, and obviously loaded with talent.  The theater itself is very user friendly with a bar situated behind the orchestra seats and a clear path to the restrooms and an additional bar in the lower basement area. Snacks and beverages are available and allowed in the theater. In this instance, my seats were in orchestra center row D and the view was great. I'm sure the view from the mezzanine was good as well but I'd stick to the general rule that closer is better, here. At more than one point during the show, the cast will be coming onstage from the audience. This is part of the reason that late entries are not permitted and that you cannot re-enter if you leave your seat unless it's intermission. The Shubert staff is very helpful and friendly. Most importantly, the staff run a well timed show so everything will start on time. Facilities are clean, modern and create the perfect acoustics for such a show as this.Definitely go see Aaron Sorkin's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and certainly check out the Shubert theater.",21,0.987

The baked goods can't be beat! I love the scones and muffins and a cupcake now and then. Pies and cakes are great! The best bagels in Manhattan. Fresh baked daily. Wide variety of flavors!! Lots of flavors of cream cheese too. You all see my photos. It's a beautiful thing! I love the window seating. Get here early if you want to sit. This place us usually full of locals eating, chatting, or reading their paper or book over a cup of coffee. If you want a full meal go to the next corner! The corner south of here has their restaurant!I can't say enough about the employees. Some have worked here over 20 years. They are friendly and professional. It's a tough environment to work in. I quickly dismiss any errors in orders. I hear people complain. They always get mine correct. Customers need to understand it takes time to train new employees. It's a large operation. You can't tell by looking at just this Bagel Shop space . The bakery supplies a lot of other business locations. In my book they do the best they can under long Six day work weeks!

57,15,3,5.0,"There's been an influx of Japanese chain restaurants lately into NYC, attempting to capture a new yorker's picky taste buds. Some have failed pretty miserably so I went into this meal with skeptic thoughts. Wow, was I mistaken - 100% one of the top 5 meals I've had in NYC this year!This is the kind of place where you pay for your meal and you think to yourself, wow that was an insane steal. As they have just opened two weeks ago, they currently only offer their omakase option which is fairly priced at $85. Take one look at the menu and you know you'll be getting a lot of food! They are conveniently available on opentable, so be sure to snag a reservation. I would suggest sitting at the counter as you are that much closer to the yakitori action.SEASONAL AMUSE BOUCHE, 4 KINDS + CHICKEN-BONE SOUPThe presentation was beautiful. We got edamame mousse with uni (not a super smooth mousse but I didn't mind it at all, it really allows you to still taste the edamame. Uni was a great topping!), spinach and mushroom (refreshing), chicken liver pate (so creamy and a bit sweet; wish they toasted the bread though!), chicken skin (not crispy but chewy, but not in an off-putting way! comes in a tangy sauce), and the most glorious tiny cup of insanely yummy chicken bone soup. I could have 1000x cups of this, I need to figure out how to make this at home...CHICKEN IN SPICY SAUCEThis reminds me of the chicken slices at totto ramen, but even more tender. The spicy sauce has a nice kick, try to avoid the peppercorns!FOIE GRAS CHAWANMUSHIOn par with how much I liked that darn chicken bone soup, this dish was GENIUS and AMAZING. The chawanmushi was so lush and smooth, best I've had! I tried to eat this as slowly as possible so I could really savor the taste and all the aromas. It was topped with truffle shavings so it's really overload in all the ways you can think of! I asked the staff if they replaced foie gras with truffle as I didn't see any. They told me that it was blended in the egg...maybe that's why it tasted so decadent!HOUSEMADE RICE BRAN PICKLED VEGETABLESJust OK, not very pickled. Good palate cleansers! Also came with a small dish of grated radish.YAKITORI (all perfectly seasoned before they get to you!):DAKIMI (Breast): Even though it's breast meat, it's soooo tender. It's topped with freshly grated wasabi.MARUHATSU (Heart): Grilled to perfection, not too mushy and not too tough. Very fresh as there was no gamey taste at all.SESERI (Neck): I've actually never had this before and I had no idea I was eating as I wasn't listening when he presented it. It had a bit of cartilage crunch in it so I thought it was possibly the knee? But it had too much meat/skin...It was the neck! SO GOOD. I'm going to order this everytime I go eat yakitori from now on :)SUNAGIMO (Gizzard): Has a nice bite, always one of my favorite pieces as I love the texture and the taste!FURISODE (Drumette): Even yummier than the breast meat (dark meat!!!), this was topped with a pungent spicy red sauce and I think he dipped it in some of sauce while grilling it. So good!FRIED CHILLED EGGPLANT/OKRA/CHERRY TOMATOES: all really good, really simple. Wish we got some mushrooms though.TSUKUNE (Meat Balls): Perfection on a stick! These meatballs are soooo tender and flavorful. The best part is the little pieces of ground up cartilage in the meatball, love the surprise crunch in every bite!WAGYU: Super tender and topped with freshly grated wasabi, but I actually thought this was slightly too salty. Other than that, the fat in the wagyu tasted pretty glorious!RICE or NOODLESince I went with my fiance, we were able to get one of each, the Toriko Shio Ramen and the Oyako Don. I was praying the Ramen had the same chicken bone broth and I'm pretty sure it is, but with a touch of yuzu or orange peel! I felt like the oyako don could have been a touch sweeter but still really good!DESSERTThis was a soba cha mousse or panna cotta of some sort with a super tangy yogurt foam. I actually enjoyed this but my fiance didn't. He said the buckwheat taste was too strong. I thought they could lessened how tangy the yogurt foam was but otherwise, I liked it!I know, I know, you're probably thinking, ""hey, torishin has 1 michelin star AND is cheaper!"" I would say, you're right, but they're both delicious. You'd be lucky to have either (if you're all about collecting those michelin stars, I guess go to torishin first haha)!I saw a couple next to me get completely different items from what we got...they seemed to be vegan, so it's nice to know they can accommodate that. Before the check, they ask you if you want any additional skewers but we were too full for any more (and I'm not sure what they cost, no menu yet!). By the time we were finished, the restaurant had really filled up!

The best part about this bakery are the prices; you don't get the pretentious highway robbery of the city or even Riverdale for that matter. $1.25 for a freshly made croissant is pretty inexpensive, all things considered.They also sell cakes, cookies and other baked goods, tortas and Mexican rice pudding. You can even get freshly made Mexican hot cocoa, coffee and teas. They are a small establishment but what they do, they do well.There are few tables inside as most people order to go on their way to work, school or home. I've even purchased a croissant from here and brought it to one of the bodegas down the block for an egg & cheese (I'm particular) with no issue.

64,7,1,5.0,"If you're considering doing microblade it's important to do your research. The best advice I could give (what I wish someone told me before I did it) would be: FIND SOMEONE GOOD, BE PATIENT, AND HAVE FAITH. Because there are definitely going to be times when you look at your brows and think ""OH GAWD what did I do?!"". As you go through the healing process your brows may look way darker and thicker than you want them to - but fear not, because they will eventually heal and look great! SEE MY BEFORE & AFTER PICS! That's why it's important to find a good place that does quality work, like Ellebrow!I got my eyebrows microbladed by Cartoon in late September. I did two sessions total (the initial session and then a touch-up 5 weeks later). And I couldn't be happier with how they came out!HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:+ Make your appointment: You can call or reach out to them via Facebook Messager on their Facebook page. They respond quickly and are really accommodating. (FYI at the time I was booking my appointment Cartoon was offering special pricing so never hurts to ask!).+ Initial microblade session: Be prepared for your first session to take 2-3 hours. The first hour or so is dedicated to completing paperwork, followed by pictures and stenciling. They sit you in front of studio lights, measure and draw the outline of your brows, and then you go back and forth to make sure the shape is exactly how you want it. (A piece of advice: feel free to come in with your full face of make up on so they can get a sense of how you like your brows to look; just know that for the procedure they'll have to wipe everything off so you may just want to bring make-up remover with you too.) After the stencil is perfect, they apply numbing cream for 10 mins, and then get started! As others have mentioned, you'll definitely hear the scratching sound. I brought headphones and listened to other things to pass the time. I did feel some pain and discomfort but nothing unbearable - it was more of a stinging feeling when the ink gets applied. Immediately after the procedure your brows look REALLY DARK. That's normal. Part of that is just the freshness of the ink, plus the slight redness cause by the microblading itself. Mine were also thicker than I was anticipating but they completely thinned out to the desired thickness over the next two weeks.+ Healing/Care: After your session they'll give you a full sheet of instructions for how to care for your brows while they heal. Be aware that you're supposed to avoid exercise/steam rooms/direct sun exposure for the first 7-10 days. You wash your brows 2x a day with water and baby shampoo + apply the provided balm. You can shower but don't let the water spray directly on the brows. As your brows start to scab up, you essentially want to avoid anything that will cause the scabs to dislodge prematurely. I started scabbing on Day 3 and it took me about 8 days to be fully healed. I could already tell + Touch-up: Three to five weeks after your first session, when your eyebrows have fully healed, you can decide whether or not you need a touch-up. The touch-up helps fill in any gaps that might exist and addresses any shape/thickness issues. This is why if you're not sure how thick you like your brows, always go thinner!! Because you can add thickness in the touch-up session. Personally, I would recommend the touch-up (especially if you have oily skin; which they say can cause the pigment to wear off quicker over time than non-oily skin). I've posted photos comparing before vs. after the first session vs. after the touch-up session and you can see a big difference in each step. In full disclosure, I felt like the touch-up session was more painful than the first (not sure why and it may just be me). I have a pretty high pain tolerance but there were definitely times where I winced. So overall it was completely painless. If you're really worried, I would ask them ahead of time if there are painkillers that are safe to take (be aware that some painkills thin your blood and can affect the scabbing/healing process so be sure to check with them first and see what they recommend!). The healing and care instructions are the same for the touch-up session. I know a lot of people who did microblading and say that it changes their makeup routine completely because you can literally wake up and go. I don't wear makeup ever and it was a gamechanger for me too! My facial features just look more defined and I think it was definitely worth the investment. Ellebrow shares amazing before and after photos from their clients. When I was doing my research I was a little worried that their lighting was making it look more flattering than it does in real life (I don't think that's the case), but just in case others want to see I'm also sharing my own before and after comparisons.",40,0.9983

I came in prior to their soft opening for a micro-needling treatment which pulled many things out of my pores and helped detox my skin. Yesterday I came in for a facial which was so relaxing that I fell asleep during the treatment. The Radio Frequency treatments tighten skin and lifts. There is no downtime! Which is great... I left glowing, and my skin felt taught and bright. If you google Radio Frequency Facials (google.com/search?q=radi…) you will see a myriad of before and after photos. Along with Teresa's skincare, this is a rejuvenating home run.The treatment involved a cleansing application, massage, and radio frequency treatment, which warmed up to a comfortable temperature. The continual motion was relaxing and not painful at all. RF energy stimulates collagen to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Perfect for women who are beginning to see the signs of aging and want to address it safely.Many celebs will have this treatment prior to an evening out. You can see in the photo that I am not too red after, and with a light BB moisturizing cream, I was off to dinner with a friend.

68,22,12,5.0,"Amazing. Maybe I'm inherently biased towards the omakase process, where the pacing and selection are completely out of your hands, and you simply sit back and let the process wash over you. For a control freak like me, it actually lets me concentrate on the food more. I'll also add a plug for eating omakase with your hands - it makes for a pretty sensual experience that you wouldn't otherwise get with utensils. So for Kaito, I had been looking forward to it for days. Kaito offers some interesting combinations and flavors (think chili, olive oil, and finger lime as accoutrements, with some pink Himalayan salt thrown in for good measure) but there were also many pieces that would appease a purist, with just a dab of wasabi and drizzle of soy sauce. The first thing they'll ask is whether you want the 12- or 16-piece. We went with the 16-piece (which comes with a starter plate, hand roll, miso soup, and tomago) and two a la carte pieces, and walked out pleasantly satiated but not stuffed at the seams. Do NOT eat the white stuff at the bottom of the starter plate, by the way. Instead of ground-up radish, as I had thought, it was pure salt and I had a panicked moment where I thought I was going to start hacking uncontrollably. The standouts:- Oyster on the starter plate. If there's one thing Sushi Yasaka and Kaito do exceptionally well, it's the oysters. I can't tell you what's exactly on them but I will say I could down a platter without any trouble. - Fatty tuno or otoro. This was one of the pieces I had to get a repeat of. - Scallop. - Miso soup. I grew up on the overly salty miso that came in these dried up little pellets - this one tasted home-made. - Ebi. - Tamago.

Nestled in the heart of KTown, this place is never not busy. My PT used to be around the corner and Woorijip was my biweekly dinner.You're feasting with your eyes first, as the selection is maddening. Their kimbap always pleases, as does their multitude of entrees that include every meat, seafood, and vegetable under the sun (or hot heat lamp). Pork belly, spicy sesame chicken, eel, chili squid, tofu salad, japchae, multigrain rice, kimchi. Don't forget your spicy bean sprout soup, which comes with every entree. I once forgot it and the cashier and I both shared a moment of disbelief.I always want to give other kimbap places in KTown a try (E-Mo, I'm looking at you), but end up right back at Woorijip. One time I found myself at Food Gallery 32 across the street and quickly exited to come right back here. My feet knows what my heart wants and carries me straight there.",23,0.8483

Beatstro is the newest restaurant/lounge in South Bronx that is paying homage to the birth of Hip-Hop and keeping very it BX from the artwork, the menu which is inspired by the community, and even the source of the furnishings. Owner and Bronx native, Alfredo Angueria, wanted to create something that older residents would appreciate and the newcomers could enjoy as well.The entrance of Beatstro has the appearance of a record store with bright hues of green, records that have been donated by local DJs, turntables, and boomboxes. The walls are covered with posters of Jimmy Hendrix, Wu-Tang, Bob Marley, and other prominent musical figures. What lies behind the black curtain is even more impressive such as reds sofas, beautiful full bar, and an elevated seating area with 100 gold globe speakers set into the wall. The menu is a fusion of two cultures that include African-American and Puerto Rican and include items such as Mojo Chicken, Shrimp & Grits, Spicy Shrimp Tostada, and Jambalaya. I didn't get a chance to eat while visiting (sad face), but you can bet I will be back to do so very soon to do so. Beatstro drink menu has clever names such Method-Man-Hattan, The Ruler, Blueprint, Blackouts, Red Top, and of course Gin & Juice. Each drink I tried (and trust I had several) was carefully crafted, smooth, and well priced. Hands down Anotherone was my favorite cocktail and included Wray & Nephew, pineapple, and bitters, and lime. I would have to say close second was Gin & Juice which was made with mango, lime, and mint.",13,0.9777
76,16,6,5.0,"My go to pizzeria in the area. Everyone has different tastes regarding pizza and not all pizza is created equal clearly. The pizza slices here are usually very good. It all depends on who makes the slices, but sometimes they're better than other times. I've had some bad pizza (it is possible), but each time here has been good - whether the slice is more well done or not. They have a lot of options and a sizable menu. Unless you're ordering something from behind the glass, I would recommend calling first if something else on the menu is what you seek. Some of the specialty slices are great, as is some of the rolls/calzones I've tried. The garlic knots could be better however. I do plan on trying more from the menu very soon, though I haven't been able to since I'm always on the go. There is a decent drink selection and you should be able to find something. There are several tables and they're always cleaned. Staff is always friendly. I sometimes work in the area and this is always my first option/choice. I will of course be back.",15,0.9817

I'm not sure how crowded it normally gets but we were able to nab one. Pizzas are only available by the pie, but it's perfect for two people because this is only four squares. We ordered the sausage pie ($12). The sausage was fine - nothing too special. I appreciated that they didn't skimp on it. But the best part of the pizza was the crust. Now, I normally don't care for crusts but this was not your typical crust. I think they push the pizza right up to the edge of the pan, and then glaze the outer edges with honey (or crack).I guess you'll find me in Chelsea more often.

I felt like he was a friend from childhood! Feel good vibes 2. Seated and my server pops over also happy to see me and my ppl getting us started with brunch mimosas! Not really sure of what we wanted we ordered Buffalo Chicken Nachos- rightly seasoned with a perfect amount of spice topped with guac the menu called for egg but i didn't want runny egg on my nachos, Chicken and Waffle Sliders- buttermilk chicken and waffle with the right amount of fluff on the waffle and the chicken was seasoned and flavorful , and M&M pancakes - well these just speak for themselves paired with whip cream! There was literally no room at the table but EVERYTHING was slap ya mama and granny good while touching your soul at the same time! 3. The mimosas- you get what you pay for! Unlimited mimosas for 90 mins, wild wild wild. No better feeling than having brunch and actually getting to enjoy it while not feeling rushed to pay and scram! 4. The music- whoever controls the music here - give them a Spotify station - Horny Ram station please!5. Cleanliness is next to Godliness and this place was clean. I dropped a good portion of a chicken nacho on the table without thinking twice I scooped it up and into my mouth it went! Too damn good to let go to waste, and they were really clean in here!

82,16,10,5.0,"Been super excited to try this place and totally waiting for summer to try it! I finally got to come here after our off broadway show to get dessert for my birthday date!The shop is a long and narrow store where you can walk in and just order the ice cream for the cashier. If you want samples, you can tell the people at the ice cream scooping area. ( it was a bit confusing ) You can get one - three scoops like normal ice cream or go crazy with a 7 flavor ice cream bouquet. And trust me, the scoops are pretty big!! They also have ice cream sandwiches, and donut ice cream sandwiches! I'm already overwhelmed with the choices and what do I wanna get to take pictures lol.After absorbing all that you get to choose from so many flavors! Few that stood out to me were Cookie Monster, royal milk tea, Thai tea, cinnamon toast, burnt honey comb, and so many more! After standing and staring for about 5 awkward minutes while debating my boyfriend and I decided to get two separate desserts and what flavors we wanted.Boyfriend : created his own Cruff sandwich with matcha and chocolate ice cream topped with mochiMine: 3 scoops ( Thai Tea, Black Sesame, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch) on a blue cone!I don't ever remember getting three scoops of ice cream ever in my life for just myself but I really wanted the ""Stuffed"" experience. I decided that since I live pretty far from the LES, it was justifiable And boy it was fun interesting.Eating experience: This is definitely something interesting especially with the large amount of ice cream if you decide to get the crazy items. For my 3 scooper, for some reason my Thai tea scoop decided it wanted to slide to the side and just sit there. I waited for it to fall ready with a cup, but it never did. I concluded. Prob they really are experts at assembling these massive cones after watching someone order a 7 scoop bouquet, and eating it without it falling apart ( totally not stalking ).Cruff: looked straight forward but the bf said it was difficult looolThoughts on Flavors: The Thai tea and sesame was delicious and if you love these flavors I would recommend it. The Cinnamon Toast Crunch flavor was great as well however off on texture... it really was soggy rather than crunchy. Maybe sprinkling cereal when they serve it would be better :/?? The blue cone was yummy! Overall it is a solid dessert place with loads of flavors to choose. And if you ever want to just be extra with your dessert or have friends visiting New York looking for that crazy Instagram picture, this would be a good choice.",14,0.9967

The staff here are friendly, understanding, and are always happy to help. For first time reservations, you have to go into the office, choose a plan you want, make a payment, and schedule a reservation. They usually text you a few days before the lesson as a remainder. And for any reservations after the first one, you can make it in the office or call in. For my 2nd lesson, I made my reservation in the office but didn't pay until a couple days later over the phone because I didn't have enough cash on me and only an American Express card. I did 2 lessons, an hour on the local road and an hour on the highway and they were just enough for me to regain my confidence. The instructors for the local roads and the highways are both super helpful, encouraging, and fun, as they teach and give tips and pointers. At the end of the lesson, you have an opportunity to ask the instructor anything you want like what he thought of your driving and what needs to be improved. Overall, I had a good experience here.

Was like they used a whole damn block of government cheese or something)Asparagus (was just that....asparagus)Carrot cake (MADE THE ENTIRE DINNER WORTHWHILE)My friend's sweet tooth made him unusually impatient so 10mins after ordering the carrot cake, he obnoxiously flagged down the waiter to reprimand him for the ""long"" wait. I dropped my head in embarrassment and when the waiter walked off, I quietly scolded my friend for being a douche. Two mins later our carrot cake arrived, along with one of the managers who so graciously offered to either comp the dish or bring us two glasses of champagne. I'm no fool - I opted for the champagne.

That mouth-watering cut of hog meat is breakfast paradise.You also won't want to leave without trying one of their crullers. This seems to be the draw for many patrons.

It looks like an oasis, and I longed to step in. When I saw that the specialty is udon, I immediately added it to my mental wishlist. Well, my wish came true, and it was everything I hoped it would be and more. We had a reservation for 6pm and we were seated immediately close to the window. The service was impeccable, and the server diligently explained all of the popular favorites. There are lots of vegetarian options, and they can even alter the udon broth to make it vegan.We wanted to order EVERYTHING. The tuna tartare with quail egg appetizer was so tender, we were amazed. (Fair warning that the egg is raw.) The vegetable gyoza were perfectly pan fried, not too oily. The cadence/speed at which the food came out was phenomenal. We were very hungry, and the servers watched us carefully to pace the food. Because J is pescatarian, we ordered the vegetable tempura udon and the eel donburi. The donburi was by far the standout. INCREDIBLY flavorful, with a fluffy egg concoction woven around the delicious eel. Rice was moist and perfect. Udon broth is sweet, and adding the spice mixture creates the umami. We added nameko mushrooms, poached egg, and mochi. I honestly can't imagine a better dinner. The portions are very generous, and the service has such attention to detail. They made sure we had all the proper sharing bowls and utensils ahead of time. The ambiance manages to find a balance between bustling, peaceful, and unpretentious. Our leftovers were boxed up neatly, and we never felt rushed even though there was a line waiting for tables. I am just so impressed and I can't wait to come back.

Wow, that's pretty weird, but cool. Way to fully utilize pricey NYC real estate. They have a pretty small menu, but everything we got was extraordinary. I was a little skeptical about ordering the Roasted Veggie dish, because from the name to content of the dish, it just screams ""I'm just boring veggie, order me if you don't want to feel guilty about only eating meat"". But oh, my, gosh, that was the best roasted vegetables I have ever tasted - it was out of this world. The blend of the spices and the texture of the veggies make them taste meaty, satisfying and savory.So good and so unexpected.We also got the truffle burger. Honestly I expected it to be good already since it has truffle oil in it, but it was also cooked to perfection. On top of that, I had a drink that was literally LIT (lit as in on fire, and I am not abusing the word literally). Super creative, and the the drink was delicious.

The vibe, the service, the set up of the restaurant, the food...everything together made this dinner experience one of the most memorable. I am a huge fan of the old school cozy steak house vibe and this place hit the mark. It's a tiny restaurant, with only about 10 table tops, ranging from maybe 2-6 people per table. Very small, thus make reservations, 30 days in advance at the very least. I logged on at resy at midnight to make reservations for a month later since that was when the date to make the resy was available and the best time I could get at 12:01am was a 10:30pm reservation. Worth it regardless.We were a table of 4 and shared the following:Bacon: delicious! It was exactly what I would hope for in thick cut bacon. Crabcake: good to split between 4 people. It was super crabby, tons of meat. Soft on the inside with a nice simple crunch on the outside. Very well done.2 cheeseburgers between 4 people: Definitely share if you are trying a lot of other things. I was actually being a brat advocating for each person to get one burger on top of everything we were ordering but glad we went with splitting. It was soooo good. The meat was so juicy, perfectly cooked. The egg was a great addition.4 Charles Prime Rib: Super tender, thick, fatty, juicy, mouth-watering delicious prime rib, bone in. They provide seasoned salt on the side and au jus. Add both! Prime rib isn't my favorite cut but this was amazing! Beautifully cooked.Sides: Brussel sprouts, truffle mac and cheese and elote corn. All of it was delicious and plenty to share for a table of 4. The corn and mac and cheese was super creamy. The corn had a lot of acidity to it which was great to cut the fattiness from the prime rib and mac and cheese. Brussels were your typical well-cooked soft brussels.I also had their classic old fashioned with the meal. The perfect complement to everything.Overall, 5 star dining all the way!",21,0.9984

I do not recommend visiting any ""psychic"" at all, but if you do wish to visit one, do it with some research.

I was primarily interested in asking about my love life, and I was seeing somebody at that time and hoping with all might it would work out (i.e., I liked the idea of this person more than I liked this person), and Angela flat out told me it was not going to work out because he had another woman in his life who would be coming soon after at me - every card she turned for me kept saying the same thing. She was really compassionate I remember and felt bad that it wouldn't work out according to her predictions, because I told her I really liked that guy.She predicted it would end by October or November (before the year was over), but told me not to lose faith in love since I would be married in a few years.

(And, trust me, lately our luck with finding decent tuan tartare has had some epic disappointments.)He loves escargot. So do I. But, let's admit it. Most of the time, it's really all about the butter butter and dipping the bread in that. LOL.I'm not a Foie Gras person. Jayson loved his.After a few minutes, you kind of forgot that you were in a tiny space because the vibe was so good and food as good as expected.My recommendation. Definitely make a reservation (we did), otherwise you'll get stuck sitting right at the front where all the foot traffic is, and all the bar activity. Unless that's your thing.Looking forward to a return soon.",14,0.991

You've gotta get the garlic and butter sautéed calamari if they haven't sold out. Even their house salad is hugely sized and the ginger dressing is delicious. The fried chicken katsu bun is another unique dish - both the bun and chicken make it sweet, zesty and savory. Also enjoyed the crispy rice appetizer, which big chunks of creamy tuna on it. They so generously gave us this in honor of their opening.Welcome to the neighborhood.5 Stars!!!!!!",18,0.9916
105,24,21,5.0,"""A delectable journey of mystery and desire. Created by: Umber Ahmad | DISCOVERED BY: Tom Collicchio""Hahaha! Man. THAT (The all-caps portion above) is the richest thing I've experienced at Mah-Ze-Dahr Bakery. ""Discovered""? You mean just like Columbus ""Discovered"" America? No, seriously, man: What exactly are you taking credit for? Discovering an exceptionally talented woman who belongs to a minority? Isn't return on equity enough anymore? I'll cut Tom slack (having seen his twitter posts and politics) that the self-promotion followed a negotiation agreement like those on Shark Tank... because, TODAY that branding just shouts one word to me. Nope. Not: Woke. But, Patriarchy... Enough said. Mah-Ze-Dahr (from Urdu: Mazedar meaning delicious) bakery truly lives up to the name. It's the ONLY New York bakery I've fallen in love with in the last three years. Frankly, I've given up on the edible garbage being introduced in New York just because it's instagrammable. A cookie inside a brownie inside an ice cream doughnut sandwich? No, thank you! That's the worst kind of ""innovation"" possible. Like the Turducken. Product of a lazy mind. I'd much rather consume a year's worth of dessert calories during a month's travel across Europe...No such nonsense at Mah-Ze-Dahr. Very much in the spirit of old school New York bakeries: it does the simple things right. Execution is where they compete, and it's flawless. I've tried two different kinds of cookies: a salty chewy chocolate chip cookie that was very different from the (melty) dark chocolate explosion cookie in texture and flavor. The dark chocolate brownie is perfectly gooey (not too much or less) and neither dense nor crispy. The turnover is great and so the cake slices have always been fresh. Excellent crumb, frosting, and fillings. I've tried the Pumpkin and the Devil in Ganache (chocolate) cakes. Both superb. The highlight for me has been the justifiably awarded Heavenly Cheesecake (with a tantalizing hint of lemon). I've also loved the chocolate sable cookies with another different, sandier, texture - as one would expect.The only miss for me have been the croissants, but I expect that's because I've only visited them in the afternoon, and the humidity had done its job (no flakiness, almost crunchy bite), though even the design suggests thicker folds. I dare not show up early at NYC bakeries only to be disappointed by a croissant pulled out of the oven at 4 or 5 am... Can no longer do that to my body!Mah-Ze-Dahr is clearly my favorite NYC bakery these days. I also respect that they don't call themselves the best bakery in New York (unlike the bakery in the Lower East Side where the 'Moon' is supposed to be really 'Super'). I welcome the distinct approach to differentiation: Umber Ahmed brings deft touches to the familiar (""comforting decadence"") as opposed to making empty claims on innovation. I mean, C'mon, let's be honest: Once Dominique Ansel had introduced the Cronut, the Cruffin was a mere copycat. A ""me too"" product.... Just without the epoch defining hashtag. Here's hoping we will see a larger share of talented women get their just recognition in the (baking) world! Salud!",25,0.9956

There are a multitude of lunch specials for you to choose from, or you can order ala-carte. The Omakase, however, stood out, as it should. The chef's culinary talents were clear...I tend to prefer spicy and savory and I found it difficult to choose my favorite piece... Every piece of fish was paired with unique seasonings which were complimentary, delicate, and delicious. Most of the time there is something I would like to substitute but here I would not substitute a thing. Quite impressive Hama!The staff was professional, friendly, and attentive.

There is a extraordinary walkway bridge extending far (about an avenue long/ 2.5 city blocks) into the water that opens up on either side to an enclosed T shape right In the middle of the water like it's own teeny Island. Fantastic spot of photos, serenity, to get away from the party or view it from a gorgeous vantage point, because it's water, sand, rocks and shallow breakpoints encircling the venue. Hence, Marina Del Rey. Service was impeccable. Down to earth yet minutely helpful and courteous. At one point, I had lost my folder and jacket and sent a team searching for it only to find it with another guest. The food was excellent. The amenities were great but it really was, basically the whole dam thing. Like a well oiled machine, the place sells itself.

109,15,9,5.0,"The sides shine more than the ramen here! This is one of the few ramen bars in NYC that oozes an authentic Japanese basement ramen shop vibe. Too bad you have to tip and your dont pay a vending machine.I had the spicy ""bang bang"" boiled chicken as a side, I didnt have high expectations for it, but it was amazing. It was zesty and the chicken had texture but wasn't rubbery. The crunchy bean sprouts complemented the chicken well. The chicken paitan based broth didnt have a very strong taste to it. There was a lil bit of umami, but not that intense. It was good, but I expected more. There's better chicken paitan broth in NYC. Noodles, pork belly and the pulled pork was top notch. The cabbage and garlic were nice touches. Overall excellent taste and textures. If you've been here in the past, the mega paitan ramen, the price went up a lil bit and you only get half an egg now.Lines can be long, but not as bad as some of the other popular from Japan chains in manhattan.

112,10,6,5.0,"I've tried the other Boucherie location, but I decided to make reservations for the West Village location for 2 for a Sunday dinner at 5:30. When I arrived, we were immediately seated and had the option of sitting on the floor level, bar, outdoor, by the kitchen, mezz, and upper level. We picked the mezzanine level and was extremely satisfied with the view of the entire restaurant. There was great lighting and a slight breeze from the open windows.I started of with a glass of pinot noir which was perfectly paired with the steak frites I planned to order. To start, my friend and I shared escargot and it came in a hot plate already deshelled immersed in a buttery, garlic sauce. I dipped some bread in the sauce and it was delicious. I ordered the steak frites medium rare. The steak was cooked to perfection and my mouth watered before every bite. The fries were super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was impeccable. Every day of the week, Boucherie has a special and different dish. I went on a Sunday and the special was Lapin Chasseur (or braised rabbit with spinach). My friend enjoyed the dish very much. To finish off the dinner, we ordered the Pistachio Bombe Glacee to share per the Assistant Manager's recommendation, and it was nothing I've tasted before. It has a thin to moderate layer of chocolate cake/brownie base with pistachio ice cream topped with hot fudge which congeals a bit. Each bite was to die for! I will definitely go back just dessert! Words cannot describe it.. I had an amazing dinner with an attentive waiter. I would give it 10 stars if I could!

My fellow diner wanted to cross this off his list after visiting Bobby Flay, another fellow iron chef like Morimoto.No wait for 7PM Monday. Small restaurant with tight seating. Quite romantic as pairs sit side by side rather than across from each other unless you're at the ends of the communal tables.Ordered the tan tan ramen ($14/large), pickled napa cabbage ($10), pork bun ($4/each), and spare ribs (3/order).The tan tan ramen is a must order. It had coconut milk! It gave it a fantastic creaminess that was heavy but knowing it was coconut milk made it feel a little better. Big chunks of ground pork, slice of long pork belly, aji tama, and a perfect amount of chili oil. I also got fresh crushed garlic. The noodles tasted fresh and you could tell by the uneven noodle strands. A deliciously unique bowl of tan tan you won't get tired of. The bowl of noodles stayed hot throughout the entire time I was slurping.The pork bun was fantastic as well. A thick meaty slice of pork, some spicy mayo, and a crisp piece of lettuce. It really didn't need the recommended sriracha. The pickled napa cabbage was tasty, spicy, but a little weird. A few pieces was enough for me. The spare ribs were fall off the bone meaty with a nice fried and sauced outer layer.I'd recommend going early to beat the crowd because the line was out the door by the time we left at 8PM. Service was good. Our tan tan ramens came out way after people who sat after us got their ramen, guess it just takes longer to prepare.",20,0.9895

After just the first bite I knew I had found my new home. The adobada was my favorite. It was juicy and full of flavor. It was seasoned well and had a really good balance of flavors even when loaded with all the toppings. I prefer mine with a squeeze of lime which they generously provide. You can see them making the tortillas so you know they are fresh. Normally I can prefer corn to flour but here both are excellent. The especial is a fried flour tortilla with cheese that is then cut and stuffed like a normal taco. For a fried food it wasn't very greasy and there was just the right amount of cheese. Enough to let you know its there and be all melty in your mouth without being overwhelming. Horchata was pretty good but dont wait too long to finish it because it can get watered down.Value - excellent, $4 for a taco, I can't believe they are still in business only charging $4 for a taco in NYC that is filled with so much meat.Service - counter service, friendly, line moves fast.Atmosphere - casual, it is located inside Chelsea MarketFacility - you have to take tour taco togo and find somewhere in chelsea market to eat it because they dont have their own section of tablesNeed to know - they dont take amexWould I come back - YesWould I go out of my way - YesAdditional info - I'm very reluctant to try Mexican restaurants this far north, but I'm glad I did.

116,15,6,5.0,"Came here specifically for the pickle ice cream, which lived up to the hype. The cool cucumber and sweetness from the soft serve are cut by the pickle-y brininess. The giant tub of soft serve is spruced up by the addition of some dried pickles, which are pretty but insane-tasting. Have you ever had a dried pickle?! You know how dried fruits taste super sweet, the taste of the sugar magnified by the lack of any liquids whatsoever? Well, imagine that, but with a pickle. It just really tastes insane. The size of the soft serve is pretty substantial. You'd think perhaps this is the kind of dessert that you'd get sick of after a few bites, but it's really not.What else? If you're on the fence about buying an entire ice cream cone that tastes like pickle and cucumber, you can ask for a sample. Then, once you decide to order that entire ice cream cone that tastes like pickle and cucumber, you can do so on one of the touch screens on the wall.

119,17,7,5.0,"A delicately balanced and thoughtfully curated experience of cuisine from northwest China. Dun Huang is a wonderful gem for unique and authentic Chinese food. This is not your sweet and sour, overly fried and sugar-laden Chinese restaurant.We loved the Beef Lanzhou noodles. We had the wide ones, but next time we'll get the extra wide. The freshly pulled noodles were thin and springy, a wonderful combination. The broth was clean yet incredibly savory and flavorful. This dish was a real star.We also loved the Lamb Rice Pilaf. The rice was prepared perfectly. Each individual grain of rice was perfectly cooked and packed an umami punch.The pickled dishes were nice, with a slight preference for the eggplant over the radish. The beef roll had a nice texture that was not quite what I expected. The bing felt more similar to pita bread than the oily juan bing I'm used to. Both types have their merits.The salted cold chicken was delicious, but probably not the best bang for your buck ($8). The bao ba cha (8 treasures tea) was good but also on the expensive side ($6.50). I had to try it though, since this tea is hard to find and it's a treat whenever I get to have it.For the dessert, we ordered the 8 treasures rice pudding but they ran out ($4.50). Awkwardly, they charged us for it before realizing they didn't have the dish to serve. They fixed it by giving us the fried black sesame pudding which essentially tasted like deep fried bao wan (black sesame filled rice balls) ($6). The honey drizzled on top was a nice touch. My son thought the dish was too hot (temperature). The flavors felt more authentically Chinese so they were not as heavily sweet as my kids wanted.Overall an incredibly delightful experience. Next time, we'll order two Lanzhou noodles (maybe with extra noodles), the rice pilaf, and maybe another pickled/cold dish. Dun Huang has all the makings of a destination restaurant. Definitely worth traveling for.",20,0.9973

Alvin, the endearing, debonair owner, came around to our unique, oversized, wooden communal table, as well as every other table in the house. Brightly giving each patron a moment of his time to make certain all was in order. My awesome friend and I, gratefully commented on how appreciative we were of this lost art of greeting each patron mid-visit. A practice of the hospitality industry that should be exercised more often. During the evening, I noticed Alvin's attentive approach also trickled down to some of his staff's approach...leading by example done right. Alvin, so comfortably at ease, explaining his concept behind the name of his restaurant. It all made sense, as everything comes together beautifully. The sophisticated restaurants charm, encompasses high ceilings with intricate chandeliers, bold floral displays and Alvin's artistry of vibrant painted artwork, beautifying throughout. Patio doors leading out to patio seating, a fair sized bar and comfortable dining room, all providing space to enjoy the chefs offerings of Southern/Caribbean cuisine. Entertainment is included to add to your visit. This evenings performance was delivered by the Bossa Nova, Samba and Classical tunes of The Brazilwood Trio, accompanied by guest vocalist Barbara Lewin. The selections played while we were there, were more Classical than Brazilian, but smooth and sultry nonetheless. With all of these things, I will say, no stone has been left unturned. Alvin & Friends is a diverse, diamond, shining brightly in New Rochelle offering the best any chic, yet casual restaurant can offer.

121,18,8,5.0,"I want to start off by saying if, in some parallel universe, I were to give Sushi Ginza Onodera 0 stars for their food (which is an absolutely absurd notion), I'd still end up giving them the full 5 stars for the impeccable service, welcoming ambiance, and an overall superb and memorable experience. Putting the quality and taste of the food back into the equation, I only regret not being able to rate this place higher than perfect.I was here with my partner for their dinner Kiwami course, which runs $400 per person. The final bill will be inclusive of tax, and the restaurant does not accept gratuity.Our night was definitely special - we had the pleasure of dining in when Master Chef Sakagami was in the New York branch, and he made the experience that much better. He was funny, inviting, and personable, and watching him at work was nothing short of a spectacular performance. Each course built on the previous, and nothing fell short of expectations, unlike many of the other omakase offerings around NYC.Going in, I had assumed either the salmon course or the chawanmushi with caviar and uni would be my favorite. However, there was one black perch course that blew me away and turned everything I thought I knew about my preferred flavor profile upside down. Every ingredient is handled with the utmost care, from the fresh sushi rice that's delivered specially for every other course to the fresh wasabi that's ground up right in front of you.Overall, it's safe to say I've been spoiled by Ginza Onodera, and I can see why they were awarded their second Michelin star in 2018.

They offer two different options:$80 for 12 pcs of sushi$120 for 15 pcs of sushi and a handroll.Needless to say, I went for the lather option (heh). Super amazing, great plating, chefs are interactive and actually talk to you (kudos to you Abet - not sure if I spelled your name right but we loved you!). Each piece of sushi is made with love and you can see it from the chef's eyes. His heart was into it and it wasn't a sloppy sushi. The experience is undeniably amazing and I am super addicted to both Juku and omakase now.I highly recommend you to come here and try the 15 pcs of sushi and a handroll. You will come out full and in awe (that was me, literally). Their cocktails are also yummy so please enjoy one (recommending the one with Japanese whiskey because it's so yummy). I don't want to spoil your experience so I will say no more, but please do yourself a favor and come here. Oh, and make a reservation, it'll be wise to do so. p.s.- Great atmosphere, romantic and their downstairs are izakaya options which I would love to try soon.

It is a small location with a solid set of ladies that do an amazing job with high quality products. I have always been paired with Eugenia, not sure if that is on purpose or random. She is a gem so it really has not been a problem for me. I would recommend that you opt to frequent Raquelle's with some time on your schedule because they aim for perfection and that takes time. I typically get a gel manicure and a regular pedicure. My gel manicure has lasted about three weeks on average. The pedicures are the best and also last a while.Highly hygienic and spotlessly clean, this place fits the bill with standard prices (gel manicure and regular pedicure run about $55).

125,37,17,5.0,"I had an absolutely wonderful time at Nougatine other night. It was my first time dining here and since it is NYC Restaurant Week, we had a lovely three course pre fixe meal that was to die for. My one issue? I left the restaurant extremely full (first world problems). My friend reminded me of the upcoming restaurant week in NYC and invited me to dinner, my choice. Of course, I had a list of choices and we decided on Nougatine because well, Jean Georges, of course. I have never been and it was a long time since my friend had eaten there. I almost missed my chance at a table. I inadvertently booked a table for 8 AM (I have a no idea how I managed to screw that up) and when I called to find out what happened, the woman I spoke with explained my mistake. Despite there being no tables available at 8 PM, which is what I originally wanted, there was a 9 PM opening available which I jumped on.I found parking in the street just down the block which was very convenient. My friend was waiting for me out front and when we entered the building, I was impressed by how organized they are. We checked in with the maitre d and were able to check our coats at the same time. All three of the women at the host table were gracious and pleasant. We arrived a little before half past 8, just in case we could snag an earlier open table. We were directed to the bar to wait until our table was ready and decided to have a few cocktails. We both had tasty mocktails, I forgot the name of mine (Orchard Blush?) but my friend ordered the Thyme Lemonade. About ten minutes later, one of the hostesses came to check on us and show us to our table. We were able to transfer out drinks and she had our server bring our drinks to us. That is a small gesture but it speaks volumes on their attention to detail. We felt pampered. A few moments after we got cozy at our table, Sarah came by to greet us, give us menus and serve our drinks. Ultimately, we were seated twenty minutes before our reservation time which I greatly appreciated.We opted for the restaurant week pre fixe menu but in true foodie fashion, we also ordered a few items a la carte.Restaurant Week Menu: Tomato Soup - this tasted amazeballs! It's a more than enough bowl of creamy tomato soup poured over a deconstructed grilled cheese. The huge piece of buttery toasted sourdough and cheddar cheese in the bottom of the bowl was a nice touch.Sea Trout Sashimi - my friend's dish which he loved. We both found ourselves pausing in between bites to savour it all. Roasted Organic Chicken - my friend's dish which was served with roasted winter veggies. I tasted a bit of his romanesco and it had a nice smoky char.Wild Flounder - I really liked this dish. The fish was served over spaghetti squash which I love and a light, citrus-y yuzu sauce. I was becoming too full to finish my entrée so I had to make a decision; either eat all my fish or take it home and save my tummy real estate for dessert. Needless to say, dessert won.Warm Chocolate Cake - I loved this. It's their signature dessert, an upgrade on a molten lava cake, served with creamy salted caramel ice cream. I made the best decision to save room for dessert. Roasted Pear - my friend's dish which tasted dreamy. The pear is stuffed with Nutella and paired with a pecan praline and whipped cream.A la Carte: Foie Gras - my friend's extra. It was served on toast with pineapple-meyer lemon jam that I HAD to taste. It was soooo creamy and melted in my mouth. Worth every bite. Burrata - I ordered this extra. The plating was beautifully simple. It was a super creamy burrata ball sitting atop a meyer lemon jam with pumpernickel toasts. Amazing and probably the main reason I couldn't finish my entire meal. The service here is impeccable. Our dishes were cleared on cue, water constantly refilled and we were checked on, regularly. We were served hearty bread while we waited and I would suggest not eating more than two pieces because you will have a most difficult time trying to finish everything.Sarah, our server, was great. She had a wonderful demeanor as did everyone with whom we interacted. My entrée was waiting with the maitre d when we left and I was given a number to claim it on the way out. I would definitely come back and I'm happy to have had this dining experience.",35,0.9987

We started with the Wagyu Beef Dumpling which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I started smiling when I bit into this and didn't stop smiling for the rest of the meal. We also ordered the Tonkotsu and the Duck Ramen - both are flavorful with tender meats and a very thick broth. The wall was made of paperback books - it looked amazing!

The prices are pretty good since the promotion is going on. 14.95 for lunch and 17.95 for dinner!It's a very small restaurant and you can only find it after you walk into a dark alley which feels little weird at first. However the restaurant itself is actually well decorated and comfortable with a small bathroom. All the food is ordered via iPad which is separated nicely into categories with appetizers, rolls, special rolls, sushi, and more! When we do ayce we always love ordering few appetizers and soup or salad to warm up. Then some rolls and sushi! Then maybe few more sushi just incase we are still hungry or to satisfy all cravings and then dessert!For our appetizers round we got :Miso Soup, Salad, Tempera Shrimp and seaweed salad to share. Everything was good and definitely warmed us up for the sushi!Sushi we got the spicy salmon roll, another roll on the right side of the picture which we forgot what it was and 11 pieces of sushi! The roll we forgot was eh okay but the spicy salmon roll was one of our favorites. Everything was very fresh and yummy!Our second round we got more sushi and more spicy salmon. By the end we were so full we decided to share a green tea ice cream. The service is also super nice. They seated us at a corner table when we asked for a middle table but it was understandable since it's such a small restaurant. We really enjoyed our casual meal.Overall everything was worth it and we definitely look forward to coming back :)!",22,0.9947

I've heard from multiple people that it's amazing, but there's nothing like finding out for yourself.My boyfriend and I got the octopus, bolognese tagliatelle, rabbit gnocchi, and hazelnut chocolate torta. Both the pastas were absolutely amazing. It wasn't heavy with oil or sauce as most places pile that on. The texture of the noodles were perfect and the gnocchi was nice and soft as opposed to overly chewy.The dessert was also a delicious hazelnut chocolate praline type mixture with sea salt caramel gelato. The ambiance was nice and romantic. Can't wait to come back and try the other menu items.",16,0.9817

I was here a few weeks ago and was attended by Havolin who was behind the bar. She made me her own craft cocktail, the pink flamingo which was tasty and fresh perfect for this summer heat. She was great, very attentive. I also had the toronja sour which was actually perfect for me since I'm a big grapefruit lover. This place also has live music in the evening. Spacious, and trendy. Will always come back if I'm ever around the area.",21,0.9747
130,15,8,5.0,"I had a life revelation at The Meatball shop. My whole life, I have never liked meatballs. Its a weird consistency, its bulky and awkward to figure out how to eat, and I just would rather have meat sauce. We were with a large group, and wanted somewhere on a Fri that we could just walk in to at 8pm. Thankfully, they were able to take us. The menu is a a little confusing because it has you picking all the options yourself... but in the end thats probably the best thing ever! You first choose the type of meat (Veggie, lamb, veal, beef, pork etc,) then your starch (pasta, spaghetti, rice, risotto etc), and then sauce (mmMMm) and veggie. I went with the chicken meatball, parmesan cream sauce and risotto and it was unbelievable. UNBELIEVABLE. They also have this 'a la carte' option for sandwiches and burgers. I am not sure what made the food so great, but for my first 'real' meatball experience, it was so delicious, flavorful, creamy. I think the risotto was the best risotto I have ever had. Only two of us wanted dessert, thankfully, and we split the classic ice cream sandwich... which was INCREDIBLE.The first few times it was suggested to come here, I am not gonna lie I was hesitant and perhaps a bit pessimistic. I fully admit that, and am happy that I gave it a chance. I have a feeling this is going to be a staple to our UES life.",13,0.9918

Bold statement alert: might be the best sandwich I've ever had.It was lunch time and the line was out the door long, but for good reason. Pro tip: order on an app and pick up. Not naming any apps because there are a few out there, but the one I ordered from was excellent and put me right at the front of the line so I could get back to work in a timely fashion.Ordering to go lunches is sometimes a nerve wracking option, but this pulled pork sandwich stood the test of the 5 block walk. The bread was crunchy and fresh. Each ingredient danced together beautifully and my eyes widened with every bite. The perfect amount of spice, fresh crunch, and sweet, savory, perfectly cooked pulled pork.After I was finished, my mouth was watering for more. Still is. Add this place to your bucket list if you want to make sure you live a good life. I will gladly dodge the chaos of Chelsea Market for another go at Num Pang Kitchen.",29,0.9952

This bi-level Mexican restaurant is located in the Midtown West area open almost a year ago but their rooftop just open a little after the Memorial Day weekend. Their vibrant rooftop includes a beautiful mural of Frida Kahlo done by Victor Quinonez, colorful, the perfect amount of greenery, and colorful tables and chairs. The chef created a menu that is a perfect blend of traditional and contemporary Mexican food. The dinner menu at Vida Verde is designed to be shared and their small plates includes items such as chipotle BBQ wings, tacos, guacamole, ceviche, carnita sliders, and more. Their popular guacamole is made table-side and at your desired level of spice and comes in two different sizes as well.  Brunch is the most important meal for us weekend warriors and Vida has a boozy brunch that they refer to as Boozy Brunchacha that includes an entree and 90 minutes of bottomless drinks that ranges from $40 - $50 based upon the type drinks you get. The brunch menu includes items such as sunrise quesadilla, huevos rancheros, duck hash, and the garden fritta. Brunch is available Saturday and Sunday from 11 am - 6 pm and I strongly encourage reservations (which can be made via OpenTable, Resy, or Yelp). Vida Verde has a number of specials which include their happy hour that runs from 4 - 7 pm and then a reverse one from 11 pm - close. Their happy hour include:$10 - margarita$10 - sangria$6 - draft beer$5 - Tecate$6 - wine$10 - Tecate & tequila shot Vida Verde is a large restaurant but I what I enjoy about them the most outside of the amazing food is the great customer service.

I'd passed by this place before, not knowing what it was, with its handsome large windows, white Pueblo exterior, and dark interior with an orange glow of light creating black silhouettes of a lively happy crowd. I was jealous. I so wanted to be there. My vegan friend and I came here spontaneously after a day at the beach.This place was on our wish list, and just from the Mexican angle, as being both Texans - we were in absolute heaven. The dining room was full but not overcrowded and not over loud.  The space has the feel of an old villa that someone's cool uncle owns in Mexico City, so it feels antiqued, modern, and casual.This menu is vegan Mexican, and with a name like jajaja - Spanish for hahaha - the place feels expectedly lyrical but it's surprisingly sophisticated too. Let me tell you what we ate - Chips and salsa $3We chose the salsa verde, and let me tell you the salsa was SO spot on that we saved the small bowl of it after we had finished our chips and at the end of our meal we split it and did a celebratory shot of it. The salsa had a weight to it so it wasn't liquidy, the tomatillos and peppers tasted so fresh, and the heat was active. This warmed our hearts and our stomachs.  The only imperfect part of the meal were the chips, which weren't homemade, and while good they tasted like they came out of a bag. Mole enchiladas. $14I'm a big mole fan, and let me tell you this dish, made with jackfruit knocked it out of the park. The taste was spot on, the ingredients were lively fresh, and the jackfruit was a fun protein replacement that had texture and felt honest. The rice was perfectly done - not over cooked but fried to a crispness on the outside. My buddy had the chile relleno $13, which was also perfectly executed and had a meaty texture with the vegetables that while we're just trying to be vegetables gave you that kind of satisfaction you get from meat.We sort of kept just saying wow wow wow, another possible name for this place. Then dessert came.My friend chose churros, $8, and while those aren't my most favorite thing, I was delighted. They were freshly made, crunchy and maybe coated with nuts. The Coconut dipping sauce was more like a paste but it was delicious. This lovely cool little place feels special. You'll feel like you're a cool kid. The place is dark but not pretentious. The food is wonderful and healthy but affordable. The place was rather busy and our waitress actually smiled throughout the entire meal and even wished us good bye.

144,14,4,5.0,"I won't bury the lede here - Sushi by Bae is probably my go-to omakase place in New York.I have been following ""Bae"" (aka Oona Tempest) since I saw a Vice/Munchies video on Tanoshi in the Upper East Side almost three years ago. To my disappointment, when I eventually did visit Tanoshi, she was not my chef. So, when my friend suggested Sushi by Bae, I could not have agreed faster.We showed up right on time and were seated promptly, although the setup sharing a sushi counter with this Sushi by Bou location took some getting used to. But once the sake started flowing and fish got eaten, we felt right at home in this omakase-speakeasy concept. The selection is of course seasonal, but my favorites on the night were the rosy sea perch, shrimp (surprisingly sweet!), and of course the toro hand roll. The sushi was faultless, but what really makes Sushi by Bae exceptional is none other than Oona herself. Her warmth and enthusiasm stand out from the more reserved sushi chefs you may encounter elsewhere. We chatted throughout the night about the sushi landscape in New York City as well as her place as a non-Japanese woman in a field dominated by Japanese men. Nevertheless, what she has most in common with the typical sushi chef is her humility, that most Japanese of qualities. Since we were the last seating on the night, we lingered for over an hour after the last dish, and would have felt right at home staying even longer.At a flat $100, Sushi by Bae is one of the best values for omakase in the city. With Oona's effervescent personality and Daft Punk (also heard: Kanye West's ""All Falls Down"", Britney Spears' ""Toxic"") setting the mood, the restaurant is a refreshing change of pace from the more conservative sushi spots that the city boasts. I cannot wait to see what Oona does next - make sure to catch this rising star before she gets too high!*I had to save my 200th review for someplace special, and Sushi by Bae is exactly that!",17,0.9932

High ceilings, beautiful lighting and design of a French restaurant. This place is great as it's spacious, great for dates or group hangouts.Appetizers - We started with the escargot which came out bubbling. It was plentiful to share between 2-4 people,super buttery with plenty of oils to soak up from the delicious complimentary bread they provide. We also got the quail(caille farcie). Such a great app. The bird is tender and stuffed with foie gras. It is so good. The flavor of the foie gras beautifully compliments the quail and balsamic glaze. Definitely one of my favorites.Entree -One thing this place doesn't disappoint on is portion size. Their plates are large in size and sooooo good. You will never leave hungry! The steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare which we requested. Their fries...oh their fries. I just love love love their fries. Tastes doubled fried. Super crispy on the outside with a potatoey inside. I just looooove it. Get it as a side if it doesn't come with the entree. You will not regret it. We also got the rack of lamb, medium rare. 4 racks, beautifully portioned on carrots and tomatoes. The lamb was cooked perfectly as well, super tender and moist. The glaze on the lamb complimented the meat well, shining both flavors. Dessert- we ended with the chocolate mousse. Super smooth and creamy with some fresh strawberries. The perfect end to a delicious meal.Cocktails - I got the Mexican war which was made with mezcal. Delicious with a good hit of acid from the lime. Definitely a favorite of mine. I also got the Matterhorn. This was also very good but may only appeal to certain palates as this drink has a strong taste of licorice. I liked it very much in the crushed ice.Overall, a great dinner with super nice service in a beautiful restaurant!",31,0.9981
148,12,4,5.0,"This is a warm hotel with lovely staff members. I stayed here during my partner's birthday weekend and I fell in love with this hotel. I will most likely try to stay here as often as I can.At first, my plan was to check in early to surprise my partner but check in wasn't until 3pm. I arrived to the city with my luggage around 10am and planned to go to the hotel to check my bags while I run my errands and come back at check in time but the lovely agents at the front desk gave me a complimentary upgrade to a suite! While I was checking my bags I was rambling to her about how I'm excited because it's my partner's birthday and I can't wait to surprise him and she asked me if I wanted to check in right now, at 11am! At first I was a little confused and a little shocked. She not only upgraded my room but she let me check in while I was there at 11am, long before my partner would arrive! How sweet! I even received a personal letter with my full name on it encouraging me to let them know if I would need anything else. I felt very welcomed and it was a perfect start to my partner's perfect birthday weekend. Everything was great! My only regret is that I kept forgetting to get cash so I could leave a nice tip for the front desk agent and our lovely housekeeper. By the time I remembered, I had to rush to checkout to catch my train. I kept the tip envelope with me so the next time I stay here, which should be soon, I can hand it in!

Im comparing this to chicken karage like bessou and other karage. While bessou's karage is 4.5/5, this Raju karage would be 5/5. My first bite into the chicken reminds me of chicken nuggets. It is juicy and tender on the inside. Beware of getting burned if you take a large bite. Everytime I go to Raku, I will order that karage. I hope they can maintain that standard. For oxtail noodle, the noodles were handcut, texture was smooth and firm even after sitting in the broth. The broth was also very umami. If I had to compare the noodles to tsurutontan noodles (4.2/5), Raku noodles would be 4.1/5. The main reason is that the noodles are portion controlled. I like tsurutontan with their generous portions. This is one of those things that are good, but limited in quantity. Savor it while you can.The agedashi tofu is pretty good. Reminds me of fish tofu from hotpot. A nice vegetarian appetizer if you want something lighter. (4/5)Overall the place is very new and has that Japanese culture feel.

151,22,7,5.0,"Holy hell, this is making my revisit all of my conceptions about omakase. My initial reaction to the $58 price tag was that it sounded too good to be true. You get 12 pieces of utterly sublime fish (as well as the option of a $12 wagyu and uni handroll), no tipping, no tax. The downside is that you're eating it in a cramped little space at the back of the Bowery Market within sneezing space of strangers and you have 30 minutes. But think of it as practice for building up your express train stamina and I definitely didn't feel rushed. If anything, I liked how they kept things moving. Reservations: You need one. Not sure what it was like when they first opened but it was pretty easy. You text a number with your name and preferred date and they give you a bunch of options. Being the grandma that I am, I went with the 5:40 seating but I think they have at least two every hour. Space: You'll sit on top of your neighbor as you stuff your face. Food: I'll always order fish over meat but good god, that wagyu and uni was an umami bomb that I wanted 15 pieces of (check out my pics but they don't really do the taste justice). It's like trying to describe the taste of chocolate to someone who's never eaten it before. If you want some dinnertime entertainment, it's always fun to watch the chef use a flame torch and see that wagyu spark and glisten and burn to a red, heady hue. In general, the pieces were a little more adventurous than places like Yasuda/Nakazawa, which stick to the classic Nagiri of fish + rice without much additional seasoning beyond wasabi and ginger. Sushi on Jones steps a little outside the box, with additions like charcoal salt on top of scallop. Which was amazing.Oh and definitely plop the $12 down for the wagyu uni handroll. It's worth it, I promise, since the size worked out to about 3-4 small pieces. You can also order some extra pieces but be prepared to scarf them down as the customers for the next seating start trickling in. Price: $58 for the base omakase. I thought the caliber was up there with places like Tanoshi and Nakazawa for a fraction of the cost. Life motto: Less talk, more eating.",24,0.9942

153,16,15,5.0,"I can't believe it's taken me this long to get around to reviewing Mother's Ruin because I'll probably have my ashes spread here once the bony arms of death open to embrace me. TL;DR: I love this place. MR is a tiny little neighborhood bar with a limited selection of beers and cocktails that are fairly steeply overpriced for their (lack of) inventiveness. Why, then, do I religiously find myself stumbling into this rather nondescript bar at least once a week? Surely it's not due to the rather gruff bouncer or the bartenders, who, while friendly, rarely go above and beyond the bare minimum service. Nay, my affection for this watering hole rests upon an unshakable tenet of my existence: to love a waffle fry is to see the face of God. I live and breathe by these waffle fries with their seductive aroma and perfect crisp. Picking between the french onion dip and the hot sauce is the closest I'll ever come to knowing - fully grasping - how Meryl Streep felt at the climax of the 1982 classic Sophie's Choice. The burger is really top notch too.Tangential but important side note - every one of my friends I've ever taken here has fallen in love with it too. I'll probably end up having my wedding here.",15,0.9592
154,15,3,5.0,"Where do I begin? First off, let me say that this restaurant has given me reason to actually get up earlier on the weekends, since this place gets PACKED during eating hours. I've been here like, five times in the past two months, so I know what I'm talking about. You can also forget about coming here on Fri/Sat between the hours of 6-9, because you'll wind up waiting something ridiculous like two hours. There are no reservations here, and you can no longer call ahead to get a number- you must physically be there in order to get a ticket. Strategies to actually getting seated here: Try coming for lunch (they are open all days of the week) around 11:45. Make sure your whole party is present, or they won't be willing to seat you. You can also come here earlier in the week, like on a Tuesday, and arrive around 5:30-6:00 PM. Additionally, try coming as a party of two, as I've noticed that the party of two tables tend to have a higher turnover.Moving on, the food here is actually fantastic- the best I've had in New York when it comes to Sichuanese food. I think every Sichuanese place has something that they're good at, but SMH not only does many dishes well, but also hits all the smaller things too: service, ambiance, decor, etc etc. Below are some of the dishes I've tried.1. Sliced Pork Belly w. Chili Garlic Sauce (Liang Yi Bai Rou) This appetizer dish is what these guys are known for. The menu description is pretty accurate, but the main feature of this dish is its presentation. I'd say it's good for first timers visiting the restaurant, but is not too filling. As a regular here, it's great but I wouldn't get it every time.2. Stewed Fish Filet w. Pickled Cabbage & Chili (Lao Tan Suan Cai Yu): This is my favorite dish here, and I order it almost every time I come here. It is fish fillets, so no bones. It comes with pickled cabbage, and a white, slightly sour broth. It's slightly spicy, but not overly so.3. Pineapple Fried Rice: I don't know why everyone complains when I want to order this dish. It is probably the best version of this dish I've had, like, ever. Not only is the fried rice cooked to perfection, but you also get quite a lot of shrimp thrown into the mix- when combined with pineapple and a fried rice cooked with the right amount of oil, it is orgasmic. This isn't a dish I'd make my 'number one', but if you don't want regular white rice, this is a solid go to.4. Stir Fried Chinese Long Beans ( Si Ji Dou): One of the perennial favorites at Sichuan places, the beans here are as expected: not bad. I say that because across almost all Chinese places in NY, this dish is served, and it's never bad. I feel like if you're going to come here, may as well skip the vegetables.5. Stir Fried Pea Shoots w. Garlic ( Dou Miao): This is one of those vegetables on the menu which is listed at market price, which means what you wind up paying depends on the season. Pea shoots are considered to be a winter food, so you're likely to pay more for these in the summer, when scarcity kicks in. It was good, but again, it's kind of a waste to come here, stand in line for an hour and order vegetables, which can be made at home.6. Fried Shrimp w. Salted Duck Egg Yolk: This dish is not too bad and has a distinct duck egg taste- you can tell it's not an ordinary chicken egg due to the consistency of the yolk sauce which coats the shrimp. I thought the flavor was good, but my problem with this dish is that the shrimp isn't peeled, but instead cooked with the shell on. That means not that much of the yolk actually penetrates the shrimp, and you're left sucking on the shells if you want to get any of the taste.7. Some chicken dish I can't remember rn- stay posted.DESSERTS8. Steamed Sweet Purple Potato/Taro: There seems to be confusion surrounding this dishes' name, principally because I remember it being listed as a taro, and because it seems the word ""potato"" has been misspelled on some menus here as ""patato"". Rest assured, it is just taro. The first dessert on the menu, this is their most and only innovative dish, a kind of like a taro puree atop a cracker. The taro is also infused with some sort of sugary pop rocks. It's an interesting dish, but I wouldn't recommend it- it feels weird in your mouth due to the pop rock effect, doesn't taste the best, and is the most expensive dessert here. 9. Boiled Rice Ball in Sweet Rice Wine: First of all, there's no alcohol in this dish. Secondly, you should get this one because it's probably their best dessert here. I have always been a fan of yuan zi, and if it's your first time here, it's a light dessert and a good conclusion to any meal. Keep in mind though that this might not be made in house, but rather store bought.10. Boiled Rice Dumplings w/ Sesame Filling: The third dessert on the menu is not bad either. It is filled with black sesame paste, and is a sweeter choice for dessert. It is also possibly not made in house.",19,0.9984

I literally hate eating lettuce. The thought of eating lettuce with some crap drizzled on it gives me anxiety. A friend of mine suggested Sweetgreen for lunch. Great, I thought. Time to pay $14 to eat some grass. The traditional salad bars that I see in NYC just don't look appealing. I look at the ingredients presented before my eyes and I'm all like ""no thanks, I'm good.""I walk in to Sweetgreen and I feel like I'm in the lunch room at a swanky country club. You have these ladies smiling behind a glass divider cutting fresh ingredients, a line literally out the door and around the corner (that moves fast), and the most heavenly ingredients straight from salad heaven right before your eyes.I walked up and was all like uhh..uhh.uhh I've never been here before. If it's your first time, it's a challenge because you don't know ""the deal"", aka how many toppings you get for free, how much additional toppings are, what the dressings taste like, etc. I managed to get lucky my first time because my gf was a PRO at this. I made my own salad with shrimp and got the spicy cashew dressing. Shut the front door! This was the best dressing I ever had in my life. I had to ask them to give me an extra one on the side so I could on the low smuggle that back to my apartment. Also....shrimp?! Say what? I don't think I ever saw a salad bar with shrimp at a to-go/fast food type of place. They must have known shrimp are my favorite.The shrimp, you ask, were they overcooked? Were they chewy? I thought for sure they would taste like crap. Shrimp sitting out all day? Bound to go bad and harden/become chewy. Ohhhhhh no no. You're in the Sweetgreen alternative universe where shrimp tastes good all damn day! So get in line honey!I've also made salad with chicken, mesclun, arugula, cucumbers, spicy broccoli, carrots, croutons, and balsamic vinaigrette. MMMM baby! I think that for someone just trying out Sweetgreen, you need to try all the dressings. You don't want to get stuck with one and be like ""awww shit this salad sucks"" because trust me, Sweetgreen has the freshest/tastiest ingredients out of any salad chain HANDS DOWN. 100%. You heard it from me! So just take your time and ask them can I try a few? And the staff is awesome so they will let you try whatever you want!My favorite dressings are the spicy cashew and balsamic vinaigrette.Pro tip: Once you get your salad, put the cover on and shake it up. It distributes the salad dressing better.DELISH DELISH DELISH Sweetgreen I love you!",18,0.9874

Because, silly, this is poke bowl perfection.Every element is on point: Seafood that's fresh af, produce that's crisp and vibrant, rice that's warm and slightly sticky. Crucially, for my preferences, the bowls are predesigned and done so with restraint, so you can order quickly and also avoid the temptation of adding a bazillion toppings. The chic, minimalist ambiance seals the deal -- you feel like you're having an actual meal, not just some quick calories in a fast-casual joint.I dined at Chikarashi three straight days during the trial, and I only craved it more as the days passed by.

Interesting enough, they offer both the normal and large size as the same price, the only difference being more udon noodles. Large selection of hot and cold udons that I absolutely loved. Started with an order of asahi beer, which they were kind enough to split into two glasses. I ordered the tsurutontan deluxe, which was absolutely massive! There was an incredible amount of meat inside, making it a very well balanced meal. Plenty of carbs from the udon, yet plenty of protein from the chicken, beef, eggs, and shrimp. IMO, a very well balanced bowl of udon that I couldn't get enough of. The fried sesame leaf was a nice touch, but all I could really taste was the batter. Girlfriend ordered the mantaiko kamatama udon, which was a completely different style compared to mine. It had a light, creamy caviar sauce and also comes cold. Unique flavor that I've never really had before in a bowl of udon. It almost tastes like liquid sushi with the caviar and mantaiko mixed together. Absolutely stuffed after finishing the meal.

The seafood at Luke's Lobster comes from Maine, where sustainability is the law. This means that only a certain number of lobsters may be caught. I just read something within Luke's Lobster's newsletter or emails that said & showed photos of how Maine Luke's Lobster Fishermen & WOMEN will not take a female lobster if they see the eggs, a notch is made on part of the shell to indicate that it is a female, & it goes back into the sea. This helps with sustainability . I applaud Luke's Lobster !! IMHO--I think Luke's Lobster roll is the best there is; at least I can say, it is my favorite .

165,13,6,5.0,"Wow, this place surprised me! I usually prefer ramen or soba to udon, but that was because I never had a great bowl of udon. Fukusuke is changing my mind. Because it opened recently, the restaurant is pretty empty most of the time so getting a table is easy. The space is small, but clean and tidy. We started with the Japanese Omelette with Spicy Cod Roe which was fully and sweet and contrasted nicely with the salty and spicy roe. I got the Sansai (wild plants) Udon with an add-on of kitsune (fried tofu) and it was delicious! The clear broth was very flavorful, though a bit on the salty side; the sweet-salty kitsune was a nice offset to the broth. The noodles had a great chewy texture, and is much better than the stale and overly cooked udon from other spots. I rarely finish all the noodles and broth, but I very happily shoveled this bowl down. My boyfriend got the duck udon and was happy with his choice as well; the duck was a nice pink. As a side note, the happy hour deal seems pretty good. It's everyday 5:30 - 7, $5 house sake / wine / chu-hi, $4 Asahi, and $3 bar snacks (edamame, takoyaki, gyoza, etc). Service was nice and quick.

170,19,7,5.0,"This place was YUM. I've been eating a lot more vegan food, and replacing things in my own fridge with vegan options (cream cheese, shredded cheese, milk), but I haven't fully converted. I think my Italian side is struggling with the letting go of all the delicious real cheeses out there. Needless to say, I've been trying more and more to cook vegan, but sometimes I'm still a little skeptical of meat replacements. Here I ordered an avocado ""BLT"" and was wondering what the ""B"" would taste like... It was shockingly good. No idea what in the world the replacement was, but it was brilliant. The way they smoked that vegetable was impressive to say the least. It came as a wrap, not a sandwich, which I didn't mind. Just a side note in case that's a deal breaker for anyone. Since there wasn't any thick bread, just the thin wrap, you really tasted all the flavors of the inside. Thinking about this right now is making me hungry. I also had the avocado fries (avocado slices deep fried), which I split with two other people. It's a lot for one person if you're also going to have a main course, but two people can easily finish as an appetizer. My friend ordered the carrot cake, and I wasn't going to try it but curiosity got the best of me. DEE-LISH. The coffee was really bad, but I mean... whatever. The three things I did try blew me away. Maybe my review will change after I've had a million vegan dishes, but I still am very impressed when there's an all vegan meal and I don't miss cheese or eggs.

On the block that this place is on, this place definitely stands out as it is the most modern looking one amongst old-school storefronts. The décor and ambiance is very cute and homey. There are 4 big tables that can seat a group of 4-6, one bar high table with two bar stools, and there's also a bench. This place is a good place to eat and catch up with friends since it's easy to chat in here without having to scream at the top of your lungs.I heard about the infamous avocado coffee smoothie and had to try it. It looks that the price of the avocado coffee smoothie has decreased based on the initial reviews below. Currently it is priced at $7, which I am not mad about for three reasons 1) they use a shot of Toby's Espresso, which is expensive enough on its own if you've ever had a Toby's latte (which is about $5), 2) they use half an avocado in the beverage, which is more than a scoop of guac at chipotle and they charge you an additional $3 for that, and 3) the avo-coffee smoothie is really creamy, filling, and can be a on-the-go meal replacement. This drink is the bomb and I would most definitely buy it again.I also tried the lox avocado toast ($12) and this was really tasty as well. The price for this can be a turn-off at first but it is much better when you see the plate since everything is at a 1:1 ratio. The toast comes with cream cheese, avocado, a hearty helping of lox, paprika, and a side salad. If you're thinking that this is a bit pricey you should consider the other factors. A standard lox bagel in the city is $8-$10, and that comes with bagel (the main filler item), cream cheese and lox. For $2-$4 more you get avocado, a side salad, and a nice indoor place to sit, which pretty much leads to a more balanced mid-day meal.A toast + 1/3 of the avo-coffee smoothie will fill up a small person, while a toast + majority, if not all, of the avo-coffee smoothie will fill up a normal person who can eat.Perhaps think about creating a rewards program linked to the credit card used.

Before we arrived, I got in a huge fight with my dining companion. When we got there, there was a huge confusion on seating and we had to wait for everything to be sorted out. We get seated all the way at the end near the employee room smooshed together . The lovely manager, Josh, gives everyone free sake and extra sushi for the little delay. Mind you, the wait wasn't even that long-def not something to be complaining about, but def the way to get me coming back for more though.The first couple of pieces were sooo good. I looove ikura A LOT and the ikura did not fail to shine-""ikura lot"" about this roll. All this time, I still have not forgiven my dining companion. And then, the uni came. Let me tell you, ""u-ni-'d"" this. This was soooo good that it was able to warm the cold shoulder treatment I was giving to my table mate and I just HAD to forgive him to tell him how good the uni was. My cold shoulder treatment is usually prescribed for at least a good strong 4 hours --that's how good the uni was. Josh (manager) tells us that they buy their uni depending on the tides at the time, so you're guaranteed the best of the best!Service is excellent here. Josh saw my resting bitch face during the beginning of the meal and was so worried that the seating fiasco/food was ruining our mood and he purposefully came up to us to make sure everything was ok. He's in charge of quality management, which is great cause he really knows his stuff-his first omasake was in JAPAN when he was 17-quality definitely managed! When talking about affordable sushi, sugarfish is my usual go to restaurant to talk about. Sugarfish is about 40$. This is 50$-and this ""bou-'d"" sugarfish waaayyyyy out of the water. Def more than worth the extra ten dollars. Not even comparable. Sushi by bou makes me want to change my sugarfish rating from a 4 star rating to just a 3 because this place sets a very high bar for affordable good sushi. ALSO Some Japanese places don't offer soy sauce or wasabi on the side-any extras the sushi needs is already added in by the chef. This place also encourages you to eat with your fingers -the proper way to eat sushi. They give you a little wet napkin to wipe your in between pieces.

This meager space on Hester Street has a perpetual line out the door, and for good reason. At just $5.50, you can expect two meals worth of savory, flavorful meats and vegetables. Roast Duck and Roast Pig will cost you an extra $0.50, but it's worth the small hike in price. They also allow you to half and half between meat selections at and equivalent charge. Meats come with an option of rice and cabbage or noodles. Out of all the varieties I've tried so far, the roast pork is by far my favorite. The thin slices are chewy and tender with a hint of sweetness to keep your taste buds engaged. The roast pig is also a popular item; crunchy pig skin with fatty, soft pork gives you added texture and enhanced salty, savory flavors. Be sure to come here early if you're interested in the roast pig.. it sells out fast!This is one of the best bangs for your buck you can hope for in Manhattan.

174,15,6,5.0,"Out for a solo dining expedition and still under the weather last night, I decided to try out Davelle, a new and unassuming all-day Japanese spot on the LES. As few of my usual dining companions appreciate oden, the focus of their evening menu, I figured this was a good one to scout on my own first.Around 7 pm on a weeknight, it wasn't crowded, just a few small groups coming and going. Similar to their sister spot Izakaya in the East Village, the decor is simple but thoughtfully considered. Exposed brick complements a weathered metal wrap-around bar and hanging bunches of dried flowers. It's very cozy and a little rustic. Chill music like Tame Impala played over the speakers at a reasonable volume.The menu is dominated by oden. For the uninitiated, it's a simmered dish with components like hardboiled eggs, stewed vegetables, sausages, and various kinds of tofu. The broth is light in body but a little earthy. If you've never tried it before, some of the components can seem a little intimidating, as there's some names you may not have heard of and some unusual textures, but the flavors are typically mild and wholesome, and I don't find it to be much of an acquired taste. The staff is also happy to explain pieces and help you pick.In many places, oden is served all together like a hotpot, but here they served each piece to me individually, possibly because I was eating alone and not in a hurry. You can order by the piece (most $3-5) or get a set ($14 for 5 or $25 for 10). I found the five oden set to be filling and quite a good deal, though my appetite is on the smaller side.If you're not in the mood for oden, they have several Japanese comfort food entrees like Napolitan spaghetti and pork curry, as well as a share plate section with fried chicken, pickles, and the like. Do note that tax and service is included in the prices.For my five oden set, I went relatively traditional, with enoki mushroom in tofu, konjak (yam cake), gobou stick, fish cake, and fried tofu. Each piece was beautifully rendered. My favorites were the mushrooms, tucked away in a speared tofu pouch dusted with chili seasoning, and the gently flaking fish cake. The broth was simple and warming. This food is almost meditative.Each piece was brought out individually once I had finished the previous bowl, resulting in my visit lasting about half an hour. This was one of my most successful solo dining adventures yet-- I always had something to do instead of just scrolling through my phone, and I could take my time. I never felt awkward, and left feeling relaxed. Staff was very polite and sweet.I hope they can both succeed in this space and maintain their peaceful atmosphere. For now, it's BYOB, and it sounds like they'll be getting their liquor license in the next few months. I'll be back to try out their daytime offerings.",27,0.9981

I made a reservation online easily for 7:30 a few weeks in advance, but the restaurant didn't have many empty tables while we were there so I'd definitely plan ahead.Started off the night with the Royal Engagement and The Don for drinks, both of which were very sippable. The Don came with a side of chocolate candies to enjoy with the drink as well.As many other reviewers have noted, the complimentary bread and butter is amazing. You get an entire mini loaf of fresh baked bread (seriously, when we cracked it open it was still steaming) and salted, whipped butter. For food, we split a half dozen oysters, ox cheek mac and cheese, and the baked chicken for two. Everything was delicious (especially that mac and cheese). The chicken was prepared 3 ways - the white meat came plated with morels and some sort of puree, while the dark meat came in mini sliders and a separate pot with jus poured over it. So good! Not as good as the Nomad chicken, but still delicious.Dessert was the apple tarte tatin for two (the panna cotta from last time is no longer on the menu, thankfully), which was seriously one of the best desserts I've had. Nothing fancy about it, just a perfectly prepared apple tart with caramel sauce drizzled all over it, and I couldn't ask for more.Meal ended with complimentary almond financiers. Would definitely come back here for another special (or even not so special) occasion. Also - they have the best smelling hand soap I've ever used.",10,0.9978

I always order the Mt Qi. and here it was the same reliable favorite as it is at its many other NYC locations with the same awesome tender beef, superly flavored and spicy soup, perfect noodles, all presented with fresh speed in an efficient environment. The same all-important napkin holders are at a few spots.This location's memorable namely for that long corridor from the kitchen towards the rear where there're many more seats and a 2nd kitchen thus a 2nd pickup window and no loft/balconey/mezzanie level seating thus a pretty backed up crowd for ordering and seating and eating all thru the door even (or especially) in the winter months.",13,0.995

The lamb is tougher but the spices are unlike anything I've ever experienced. The chicken is tremendously tender and that yogurt dipping sauce I could eat by the gallon. The rice is also phenomenal.

We had reservations maybe a month in advance for a Friday night dinner, and they were definitely required as we heard others being turned away with 2+ hour waits. We ordered the classic combo that was recommended by friends and the waiter - an Emmy burger and a Grandma pizza. Our waiter said his personal favorite was one of the pinks (pizzas with vodka sauce), the Arenstein, so we dove straight in for that choice. The pepperoni, pickled chili and honey combination was the perfect medley with savory deliciousness accented by a hint of sweet. The burger's pretzel bun was divine, and the fact that it came with curly fries was just the cherry on top. Definitely come here ASAP, your taste buds deserve it.",18,0.9912

The space is clean and easy to navigate, which is important when we have a big crowd. Due to the volume of beer that was being consumed, the bathroom line was usually about four deep at any given time, but otherwise, ther were no logistical issues. Service was stellar from everyone.

I saw someone had a box of their egg tarts at a bar in the east village so I bookmarked it on yelp. And then I came and devoured! For a box of 6 it was $19. It is definitely worth a try here. We were fortunate enough to get it right out of the oven. It was still hot when I had my first bite. This place can definitely compete with Lisbon's. The crust was super flakey with multiple layers of crisp. The egg custard was super creamy on the inside, sweet and delicious. Sprinkle on some powdered sugar and cinnamon like the Portuguese. So good. I had the remaining cold and it was just as good. YUMMMMMY! I will definitely be back again devouring these little goodies.",26,0.9915

(Well kind of) the thing about Central Park is that you can easily get lost or walk around in circles lol. My journey began at 59th Columbus circle  Right at this entrance you have the horse and carriage as well as bike and rental . This park is beautiful and has plenty of things to do on a gorgeous sunny or rainy day. They have boat rides ,restaurants , museums and many playgrounds for children. In the summer time there's even more to see such as Victoria gardens, the pool , carousel and the list goes on. What I love about this park is the beautiful views, all the hidden cascades and of course the flowers. Central Park it's great for hiking, jogging and walking. On top of that they also have a zoo! Not as large as the Bronx or queens but a decent zoo. In the winter time they have the ice skating ring so plenty to do all year long. There's also lots of hot dogs stands and about 2-3 restaurants (tavern on the green and loeb boathouse). I want to say that I started out at 59th street and then I walked to like 94th and somehow ended up again back at 59th street so be careful as there are many paths that may lead you back to point A! lol it's a maze but a very beautiful one to get lost in.",44,0.9852

186,30,21,5.0,"If you call Carbone anything other than the apotheosis of a perfect dining experience, your soul will promptly exit your body.I read about forty seven reviews before I dared enter Carbone. The Yelp reviews for Carbone are in the same vein as the infamous Amazon reviews for Haribo sugar-free gummy bears or the Three Wolf Moon T-shirt; while scrolling, you lose yourself in the lore of what people write and begin constructing an alternate universe out of the facts and fiction, neither of which are distinguishable from one another.The first fact-or-fiction moment begins on the corner of Bleecker Street, where Carbone's effervescent letters cast neon on passersby, the sign acting as either a beacon or a hooded figure leaning from under a shadow to warn that your life will fundamentally shift after you pass through.The Carbone experience is an experience that happens to you. I purposefully chose ""to"" as the preposition to follow ""experience"" because Carbone unfolds and draws you close; the staff flutters about, dishes are served as if delivered by a stork, food likely to be the best food you'll eat in your entire life is waxed lyrical before, during, and after consumption, and an ineffable feeling of ease among all guests settles in as gently as a penumbra.The staff at Carbone is comprised of human talismans who eddy through the restaurant on panache and conviviality. Ask for the location of the restroom and you'll be escorted to it via Moses separating the sea, or dine on distilled colloquialness from the waiter and you'll feel like old pals.James Joyce once wrote, ""The artist, like the God of creation, remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails.""Joyce's quote is the foundation on which I imagine the owners of Carbone: three masters cloaked in velvet burgundy suits hidden behind a Julian Schnabel painting poked with peepholes, observing their patrons marveling at the spicy rigatoni vodka and how they'll never again enjoy vodka sauce because Carbone's is so perfect it could be consumed as soup, tearing up at the sight of a cast iron skillet of meatballs borne by divinity, and gasping at how all future life experiences involving veal parmesan are forever ruined by Carbone's lionized and utterly unmatchable dish.""'What is life if not the shadow of a fleeting dream?'"" says one of the owners, quoting Umberto Eco.Another owner, swirling the last drops of an orange and cinnamon margarita over ice in a glass that catches the glint in his eye, says, ""What is Carbone but the fleeting dream itself?""",28,0.9031

Upon entrance, the huge bar is on the left with lots of table seating on that side. The regular tables are on the right and go back into the distance. The whole place is decorated with white subway tiles and huge framed mirrors on the walls. Authentic Paris bistro surroundings. The menu has interesting French selections and there is a separate menu for steaks, several selections are for two persons. For starters We selected mussels with a wonderful cream sauce and small slices of sausage. I had the arugula salad with candied pecans, scrumptious. We each had two glass of generously poured red wine. I had the 16oz center cut fillet mignon served perfectly medium rare, just the way I like it. Julie had a beautiful portion of cod served upon a nice orange sauce. We shared a desert of pistachio ice cream served on a chocolate cookie. Two coffees with refills and we were stuffed. The waitstaff, hostess and everybody we came in contact with couldn't have been more gracious. They treated us like long lost friends.

If you're not familiar with Artichoke Basille's pizza well you've been warned that eating anything more than one slice might just be overkill. The slices here are huge but not obnoxiously big. Their dough is different from what you'd get from most other pizzerias in that it resembles more of bread type consistency which is necessary to hold whatever sauce is on it. I usually go with their classic artichoke slice which reminds me of artichoke dip on top of a pizza with a nice amount of mootz..Its heavy, keeps my belly full, and is a bit pricey for a slice but you get what you pay for 10x.That's all there is to really say about Artichoke Basille's.

190,17,7,5.0,"While I intended to search for a decent steam room in NYC, I instead discovered Modo Yoga in freezing snowy weather, a hot yoga studio where students practice in a heated room. What I really liked about this studio is that it is not only a studio where students practice yoga in a heated room, but there is also an incorporation of spirituality and safe space, which is something rare when it comes to hot yoga or classical yoga. There's this calming effect after the practice which is something that usually I feel after practicing kundalini. So far I have taken only two classes and I really liked Sasha's class... his class had me coming back for a double and considering about signing up for a month unlimited. Modo Yoga is located two doors down from Benefits, and you have to walk up the stairs because the elevator does not go to the second floor. The staff members are really nice and the mats, blankets, towels, and re-usable bottles are on-the-house for first time students, even if you come back for a double on the same day with a few hours gap. For a re-usable stainless steel bottle, you have to leave your ID at the front desk. They have filtered water to fill up your bottles... and hot tea too. After practice, the mats are to be wiped down by each individual students on the hanging rods. The changing rooms are equipped with lockers with built-in locks, two sinks, three toilets and four shower stalls. It is recommended to drink about two glasses of water 90 minutes prior to the practice and two glasses of water with lemon, sea salt, or an electrolyte replenisher after the practice. $40 for the first month unlimited and $115 afterwards.",17,0.974

I now present a highly scientific comparison of the two and while I think Levain still comes out ahead, there's no way I'd ever turn down a Chip cookie. Variety: This one is in Chip's bag. While I appreciate Levain's philosophy of sticking to three tried-and-true cookies (CCC and walnut, oatmeal raisin, and chocolate and PB), Chip throws down the gauntlet with a dizzying array of options. Thus far, I've tried the S'mores, Nutella with sea salt, and white chocolate and macadamia. They are all reasons why God intended you to eat one or two whole cookies and take a restorative nap. And trust me, it took some real willpower not to just throw in the butterscotch and triple chocolate too. Taste: Pretty much the same. Both boast an enormous gooey center and taste kind of like a scone or biscuit. Both are more spherical pucks than a traditional flat cookie. Both are better in your belly.Bang for your buck: Levain is a smidge bigger for roughly the same price. Ugh, this was entirely unproductive and I think I'm a few pounds fatter from all of this scientific research but it was worth it.

I have yet to try everything, but I can speak to several of their desserts.I will note first if you are coming by around the holidays, expect a long line out the door. Order ahead if you want something guaranteed. Also, they serve pies in the morning, cupcakes in the evening, and specific flavors on certain days of the week. I have tried numerous things here: the mini key lime pie, key lime cupcakes, peanut butter cupcakes, brooklyn blackout cake and cupcakes, red velvet cupcakes, chocolate/vanilla sprinkled cupcakes, holiday themed cheesecakes, coconut creme pie, chocolate mousse pie, tri-berry scone, chocolate chunk cookies, and oatmeal raisin cookies.Everything is amazing. My personal favorites are the key lime cupcakes, key lime pie, and chocolate mousse pie. Their selection can be limited or sold out by certain times of the day, so your best bet is to come in the morning or early afternoon, except if you want cupcakes. All their cookies are large, soft baked, and delicious. Their creme pies have a wonderful texture. The list can go on, but I would recommend their creme pies and cupcakes first. I love this place.

Let's be honest... it's a different creation than any other slice.Things I like here: Every single slice they serve but I highly recommend the artichoke slice of course. Bigger crust and dough, creamy and cheesy goodness along with the size of this slice makes not only every late night drunks dream but even for those who are looking just to enjoy this beast. I mean if I can't eat more than 3 slices then their slices must be beast (I can serious chow down on some pizza).Things I don't like: I've been to a many of their locations and like many of others, this one gets packed, especially late nights....... oh! and its super small so the line does out the door. I think those are the only issues I have here. (thinking........)The service is quick which makes the line less scary and despite being bombarded by a million hungry New Yorkers they seem to keep it friendly...... seriously guys!

I also remember rolling my eyes at the ""hype"" and how everyone will get over the ""cronut"" till the next food trend comes out.Well, I was surprised to learn there is still a huge line outside to get cronuts. Also, this location only makes a set number of cronuts per day (your loss if you're too late), and sometimes with a maximum number you could buy per day (two is the limit with a huge line)...basically there has to be something good here if this keeps selling out.And I can safely say that the cronut is worth the hype. It has dimension, a trifecta of flavor, and it's just the right size for the steep price ($6.50 per cronut). This month's flavor is blackberry & buttermilk and it was absolutely delicious and worth the possible 700+ calories.I'm not sure if I will be back every month to try the ""flavor of the month,"" but this is not a bad option if you're feeling down (or happy).",18,0.9586
200,20,7,5.0,"A rare gem in NYC. Exquisite food, wonderful service, and a rustic ambiance make this one of my new favorite restaurants in NYC.We came to Gramercy Tavern as a party of 7. Originally I had made it for 6 people and added 7 at the last moment. I was worried that they would be unable to accommodate our last minute change but they were able to increase our table size.I was also worried due to the fact that we were such a large party, and we had a special cake that we wanted to present at the end of the evening, that things might not go entirely as planned. Side note, the last time that I had a special ""surprise"" cake that I wanted to present at the end of the dinner, our waiter (at another restaurant) walked right up to the host of the evening (who the cake was for) and asked ""when would you like your cake to come out"" when uh...it was supposed to be a surprise. Yikes! We were nervous to say the least.We all started with cocktails and champagne and the entire table opted for the seasonal tasting menu which had several courses (6-8 perhaps). The wait staff was on point. They all assembled at the table together to remove dishes as well as to bring new items. They did not interrupt your conversation which I really liked as there's nothing I can't stand more than being in the middle of a story and someone butting in with ""would you like still or flat water?"" Just give everyone a minute to settle in and look at everything! That, they did. I was impressed. I would describe it as overly attentive without you even noticing.The food was just, you have to try it for yourself. Definitely opt for the larger tasting course menu as there are some real gems on there. I don't want to go into the food too much to ruin anything but honestly everything was out of this world. On par (or even better) than a lot of the 3-star Michelin restaurants in NYC.The cake event went on flawlessly as they brought the cake in its entirety on a beautiful raised plate so our guest could see it (as it actually had her photo on it) and then they cut the pieces up and brought everyone a piece (and the guest was given the ""face"" cut-out from her cake, it was very cute). There also was no cake fee which I was shocked by. Usually places charge around $8 a person to cut and serve the cake. I find that ridiculous and sometimes it deters us from certain restaurants.I really enjoyed our time at Gramercy Tavern and want to go back.

Once the elevator opened, there were so many people waiting for a table. Luckily for my boyfriend and I, our friends were already seated and waiting for us patiently.I had no idea what to expect since I've never really done KBBQ.

I liked the fact that the waiters will help cook it and cut it for you too!I really liked both the pork platter and beef platter. The pork belly in the pork platter is crispy but not overcooked (thank you waiter). And you can order rice on the side, which I highly recommend, and it goes really well with it! The condiments that come with the meal are also super yummy--like the bean paste, ugh. I am so obsessed with that bean paste. I can eat it by itself or just the bean paste with the rice.

One of my favorite cuisines is Korean so of course, I had to try their Seoul bowl!I love all the flavors that were encompassed in the Seoul Bowl! The sauce was mildly spicy with a bit of a sweet/tanginess to it. The bean sprouts provided a crunch when mixed in with the rest of the toppings and quinoa. I was really happy with the freshness of ingredients and the option to have quinoa instead of rice. Also to note, they had a lot of Asian flavored canned drinks, which to my surprise was really good. I tried their Lychee!",15,0.9714
205,14,7,5.0,"We were tipsy one night, and couldn't get into any karaoke bars. We must have decided that we wanted to eat, cus we sat down to a diner at about 12:15am. Just to prove how good this place is, there was a 30 minute wait. Everything about this experience was incredible, until Gster ate all the pierogis. This was my first Ukranian dining experience, and had I been fully aware, I may have thought twice about going. Thankfully I didn't. Patch and I split the French Toast + 8 peroigis, Sean got the stuffed cabbage, and Gster never ordered. I was so excited to try the pierogis, and once they were served, we were too busy eating the french toast that before we knew it, we looked down and there was only 3 left! Patch knew not to blame me, since I had never had them.. so Gster was the easy culprit. Gster didn't even realize we had ordered them, not him! Thankfully I still got to try a few and I actually really liked them, but liked the cheese ones the best. It's like a dumpling ravioli. The french toast was perfect, and I can only imagine what the omelettes are like. The stuffed cabbage was apparently really good, but a little cold. The beers were massive, and the service was excellent. This is an absolute must, and I can't wait to go back.",17,0.9922

207,12,3,5.0,"No doubt in my mind, this is the best pizza in New York City. This is saying a lot, since there are so many great pizza parlors in the city. Of course it's a matter of personal taste. Some like their pizzas greasy, so the oil drips all over their fingers. Some like their crust thin, others like theirs thick. Preference for toppings is all over the place. The only pizza that's awful is sold at the now ubiquitous 99-Cent/slice stores that sell re-heated pre-frozen pies. My Pie makes authentic Roman style pizza. The flour for the dough is imported. The ingredients are fresh. The slices are square. It tastes like the pizza I eat in Rome at the Pizza Franco e Cristina on the Via del Portico d'Ottavia.

The workers are real nice and told me they only made greentea in this store now. I should have asked it was permanent flavor or seasonal, but I assumed it was permanent.

209,20,14,5.0,"Three things I've learned from eating here and from friends' reviews:1) Avoid the ""typical"" stuff like pad Thai, noodle dishes, etc.2) Avoid most of the lunch specials, a bunch of #1's dishes are offered and the quality just isn't that good.3) Avoid chicken dishes.That being said, this is one of my favorite Thai places. The service is friendly and the Isan food is great if you know what to get. Some of my favorites:Papaya salad (som tum) - Both the Som Tum Thai (with dried shrimp and peanuts) and the Som Tum Poo Plara (with preserved crab and pickled fish) are delicious, though the latter is more pungently flavorful. I love spicy food, but this papaya salad is too beast for me. Everything at the bottom soaks up that fiery, vibrant marinade, so the closer you get to finishing, the more it burns. I always have to remind myself to go pansy mode and get this mild. The few times I've forgotten have been heaven and hell all at once.Spicy ground meat salad (larb) - I always get this with crispy pork (moo krob) and wrap it in the various veggies they provide. Larb is listed as with ground meat, but this is just thinly cut, slightly bigger pieces of meat. The vinegary, sour, and sweet flavors go so well with the crunch in this dish.Pad ped - This comes with Thai eggplant, bell peppers, basil, and wild ginger in a spicy curry paste. It's nicely savory with a bit of sweetness. I usually get it with catfish (pla dook), so I have to deal with the minefield of bones, but it goes so well with the sauce. I don't like eggplant, but Thai eggplant is an exception. It's small and green, and the sliced pieces look a bit like okra but are way better (I hate okra with every fiber of my being unless it's in stew).Sauteed morning glory with fresh chili (pukk boong fai dang) - Such a good side dish. I had it with crispy pork once and there was too much fattiness, so now I get the simpler one, but it never lacks flavor and a bit of spice.Spicy lemongrass soup (tom yum) with seafood - So fragrant, sour, and the hot broth feels so comforting... until the spiciness hits. They put a good amount of shrimp, squid, and mussels inside.Frog legs - This is one of the first places I ever tried frog legs in. I always get them with basil sauce. They have a slight crunch on the outside but are tender inside. I've tried the version with garlic sauce, which is okay but much milder. I doubt I'd choose it again over the basil sauce.Make sure to get sticky rice. It's a great accompaniment for many of the entrees. Grab a small ball, smooth it into a disk, layer some meat and veggies in, make a little wrap, and enjoy. Their Thai iced tea is a bit more sweet than I'd like, but it's good for washing down the spiciness.I've taken many people here. I view it as a rite of passage for our friendship: If you enjoy the food here, we'll be just fine. If you don't, it's probably better that we cut ties and go our separate ways.",34,0.9977
210,21,12,5.0,"one of the best baguettes to grace a banh mi in terms of mouth feel!the lightly crisped thin-crusted bread while still being soft on the inside did not shred my gums. This was the best part. Most banh mi baguettes have really hard thick crusts, while crisp and crunchy, it will shred the roof of your mouth and gums. I ordered this via eat24 and the sandwiches arrived still warm and crispy even with the below 30-degree temps outside. good job Xe May.Get the duke sandwich. While $9 is a lot for a banh mi, the bread and meat combination works here. The meat to bread ratio was on point. not too much bread with an acceptable amount of meat. Its Viet meatballs that taste like sweat and zesty mixed with savory corn beef hash. Mixed with the crispy veggies, jalapenos and aromatic crispy bread, this was a symphony of flavors and textures. I also tried the classic sandwich and I suggest passing on it.For $8 for Viet ham and headcheese, it doesn't taste any better than your $5-6 banh mi besides having excellent bread. plus they use the same zesty sauce in it as the duke. IMO, the classic Viet sandwiches need to have mayo and pate instead. It's good, but I rather get it from another place.",28,0.9089

Beautiful wood paneling, brick wall backdrop, long draped curtains and dim lighting for all your date night and group needs. The owner Tarik was the sweetest host, as were his servers (our main guy being Khalid). Water constantly refilled, table checked up on by 4 different waiters; they were aiming to please throughout the evening. My friends and I spent a good 3 hours there and weren't rushed at all. As a matter of fact, we received a round of Prosecco and their knafeh dessert on the house, and invited to stay even longer. All the while as the restaurant was getting packed with nearly all the tables taken.The French Lebanese food was so beautifully prepared. They started us off with pita bread covered in za'atar and a side of yogurt dipping sauce. Delicious and creamy, the pita a perfect vehicle for dipping. We ordered the Mixed Grill Platter Supreme $68, a huge tray of beautifully grilled meats including baby lamb chops, filet mignon, beef kafta kebab, chicken kafta, and shrimp. It came with sides of pita and sumac fries, and numerous dipping sauces that were sublime, especially the za'atar garlic aioli. Mezze & Dips Tray $48 was delicious as well, each with its own flavor profile. The Batata Harra (spicy roasted potatoes), Arnabeet Bi Tarator (cauliflower in tahini sauce), and Baba Ghanoush were particularly outstanding. I couldn't get enough of their dips and mezze spread all over the pita bread. We were oohing and aahing when the platters were presented, and mm mmming after every bite.

214,12,9,5.0,"Eleven Madison Park was nothing short of magical. The price may be a pain point for some (especially if you're opting for the wine pairings), but when you're devouring course after course, the rest of the world comes to a complete halt, and nothing else matters. You sit there, a fork in one hand and a knife in the other, with an expression that can only be described as a stupid, dumbfounded grin. Because in that moment, you are not the you who strolls down Fifth Avenue with shopping bags in hand, or the you who takes trips to Europe to eat the best of what chefs around the world have to offer, or even the you who works tirelessly to scrape up enough disposable income to treat yourself to a night out here. In that moment, you are part of the EMP family, and you will unquestionably be treated as such from the second you step into their doors.To get some of the logistics out of the way, I came here on a Friday night at 6:15PM with my mom to celebrate her birthday. I called ahead of time to let the restaurant know the special occasion, in addition to my aversion to cheese. Along with the tasting menu, we opted for the wine pairings, along with a table-side brewing of the High Mountain Oolong tea at the end of the meal. In total, the food came out to $642 and change, and the beverages an additional $406.Overall, I just wanted to share my thoughts on a few different points:1. Wine PairingsWhile I enjoyed the wine pairings, if I were to return, I don't think I'd be getting it again. The wines were interesting, and they definitely paired well with the food that was presented, but ultimately, I don't think the varieties we were served justified the high cost. A vast majority of the wines were French - not really an issue, just something to keep in mind if you're not the biggest fan of wines that taste earthy and heavily reflect the terroir of where the grapes were grown.2. Prolonging the EMP ExperienceAt the conclusion of the meal, the restaurant gifted us a bag filled with a jar of house-made granola from that morning, along with a cleverly designed menu of all the courses we tasted that night. The menu itself is folded in the same tin can that the caviar course was presented in, and was a nice touch compared to the plain paper menus that were handed out in the past. In addition, for my mom's birthday, they also included a large chocolate bar in her bag that she has yet to taste.3. Table-side teaAt first, I didn't think the $24 price tag on a table-side experience would be worth whatever EMP had in store. Thankfully, I was proven wrong, and I actually learned a great deal about the restaurant's philosophies in brewing both tea and coffee, along with some of the science and art behind a great cup of brewed tea. The Gaiwan set they used looked and felt amazing in its pure simplicity, and the tea sommelier was kind enough to provide an extra steeping of the Oolong as well.4. FoodTo quickly touch on the courses we were served that night:* Black and White Cookie with Cheddar and Apple - B* Scallops with Sea Urchin, Scallop Butter, and Scallop Broth - A+* Caviar Eggs Benedict with Smoked Ham and Sturgeon - A+* Foie Gras marinated with Squash and Pumpkin Seeds - A+* Poached Halibut with Turnip - A* Mushroom Tart with Cremini and Black Truffle & Portobello - A+* Venison un Croute with Foie Gras and Civet - B* Roasted Carrot with Buckwheat and Mustard - B+* Baked Potato with Horseradish and Bacon - B+* (Instead of Grilled Cheese) Chocolate Tuile with Creme Fraiche Ice Cream and Cranberry - A-* Pear-Cranberry Donut with Mulled Wine Ice Cream - A* Chocolate Covered Pretzel & Apple Brandy - A-While EMP didn't wow us with an impeccable menu suited to our exact taste buds course after course, overall, we had a sublime evening. The granola they sent us home with is fantastic, and I'm still very happy about the fact that we got to bring home the tin can with the EMP insignia branded on the top - I actually considered just taking it during the caviar course but decided against it.Reservations may be difficult to come by and try for, and the price tag may be even more difficult to justify, but given the chance, I would do it all again in a heartbeat.

215,21,10,5.0,"I was a bit skeptical about this place, both from their $50, 30-minute omakase business model and their controversial chef, David Bouhadana. My visit to Sushi by Bou started inauspiciously with me falling down their metal stairs. (Watch your step on those.) The hostess quickly ushered me inside, bandaged me up, and helped me with a lot of warmth that went beyond the typical cover-your-ass stuff. She was sweet as pie and offered me a complimentary glass of sake, as well as a discount on my meal.Thankfully, my experience was only uphill from here. Sipping on a lovely, often-refilled green tea and my sake, which was refreshing and balanced, I was treated to 10+ pieces of fish. Here's what I remember: yellowtail, two kinds of tuna, salmon, toro, scallop, uni, ikura, wagyu-uni, eel.The fish quality was uniformly very good. A few stood out: the uni, which I don't always enjoy, was creamy and sweet, from Santa Barbara; the toro was melt-in-your-mouth; the scallops were pleasantly clean tasting, set off by a nice burst of ashy garnish; the eel at the end had the perfect caramelization. I was also skeptical of their wagyu-uni (seems like throwing two rich, buzzwordy ingredients together), but it went together surprisingly well. Rice was also uniformly good.Some pieces had garnishes or sauces, which were judicious with a couple of exceptions: the sweet soy glaze on the yellowtail was too heavy, and the yuzu on the salmon was spoiled by too big of a wasabi kick.Unfair to compare this to the sushi temples of New York, but was head and shoulders above gourmet-budget options like Sugarfish and Kazunori. It's definitely punching above its $50 weight.It is a pretty quick pace, and some of these were pre-sliced for speed. It's super intimate, with about 8 seats. It's well decorated and there's a nice smell from the rice and blowtorching. The staff was chatty and friendly-- I enjoyed talking with the bartender about his travels in Japan after I finished up. David wasn't working, but I got to talk a bit with my sushi chef. I always feel a little nervous about dining solo but they made me feel welcome.Reservations weren't hard to come by for lunch (I texted a day out), but I would imagine you'd need to plan further ahead for dinner. They bill this as a pre-theater option, but this worked great for me as a quick lunch off the desk.",36,0.9956

I find their tasting menu very unique and well-executed in the balance of flavor and creativity. I've come here in a group for the regular menu back in 2017 (when it was $67) and recently again for the pricier but longer Valentine's day menu. Haven't gotten the wine pairing so can't speak on that - ordered a bottle and cocktails each time. The bread is amazing, as many have mentioned, and probably my favorite bread ever. I don't remember the specifics of the meal from last year, but the highlight of this year was the blissfully buttery Long Island duck with leg fat wrapped in morels and the apple semifreddo with lemon meringue. The cod was cooked perfectly as well. I think both experiences started with an amuse bouche involving a chip or some sort which was crisped to perfection. The main draw for me is how intentional all of the ingredients are and the fact that there are really not many dishes like them out there.I will say the somm on Valentine's was not very good and recommended some wines incorrectly based on our specifications, but we ended up happy with the bottle she picked. I also found the last dessert too chocolate and moussey for my taste.

228,31,24,5.0,"All across the isle Manhattan, tourists and natives alike forge claims about the best slice of pizza. The city's love for a classic New York style pizza pie is centripetal to understanding Manhattan's food culture, and perhaps equally important is how a person's favorite slice can narrowly define their love for a particular time, place, person, or memory in their life.It's worth noting that someone's claim for their ""favorite"" pizza can be tinted with marinara-colored glasses. Just because your Uncle Frankie took you to your favorite pizza spot when you were nine and taught you raunchy jokes every other Sunday because your parents needed a break doesn't mean the slice at that pizzeria is the ultimate best, but it also doesn't mean your love for that slice is any less valid. We all have an Uncle Frankie and we all have parents who more or less didn't want to deal with us, so if the pizza shrouding that nice memory in your life is also wearing a crown that reads ""BEST PIZZA IN MANHATTAN,"" then all the power to you.Regardless of Uncle Frankies, what I'm getting at here is that someone's favorite pizza slice may be incredible to them via sentimentality, but the slice might not be incredible objectively. I believe there's no such thing as a truly bad slice of pizza, but there's definitely a difference between okay pizza, great pizza, and pizza that takes words out of your mouth, wakes you up in the middle of the night when your subconscious remembers it, and forces you to go back to the pizzeria the next day when its doors open.Let's get to the gravy here: Pizza Suprema. As you may have guessed from the dissertation preceding this, I was told by someone that Pizza Suprema is their favorite. ""Favorite"" is a strong word and not a word I toss around, but definitely a word I'll explore when given the opportunity.The array of pizza toppings and pie variations is almost as astounding as Pizza Suprema's old-fashioned cash register, both of which are not nearly as astounding as the fullness in which the pizza lives up to the word ""favorite."" I sampled slices of plain and Sicilian to get a foundational understanding of Pizza Suprema's overall taste and style. I ate both slices at an exorbitantly slow pace and enjoyed every morsel of tomato, cheese, and ultra-thin crust. Words taken, night-woken, plotting to go again.Edward Hopper never used a pizzeria as a subject in his paintings of stoic American life, but if he did, Pizza Suprema would be his muse. More welcoming than midtown pretends to be, coppertoned, and filled with isolated moments saturated with narrative suggestion, a Hopper painting of Pizza Suprema would sell at Christie's for $200m, easy. You can feel nostalgia resting in the rows of booths, hear jokes told to kids given away for the day, and breathe pure pizzeria redolence as you experience an amalgam of delicious slices waiting to be claimed as your favorite.Where there is an absence there is also a need, but in the case of New York City, the surplus of pizza doesn't mean we need less pizza. In fact, the more pizzerias the better!

This was a pleasant surprise to try somewhere new and with good company! Although we didn't plan to stay long, it was a really fun and chill evening. The space here has an upstairs area, but that night we were here, it was closed for a private event. We all were able to find space by the bar pretty easily as there are a lot of side tables and bartenders working at the bar. The prices were decent and service is also pretty good. The music was fun and some people were dancing, though there is no official dance floor. This is not really a club but just a long bar with pretty scenery. There are also a lot of televisions if you would like to watch one of the games. You get a great view of the water and Statue of Liberty. I would love to come back and check out the space upstairs sometime.",16,0.997
230,14,11,5.0,"Thank you for bringing such a great omakase experience to my neighborhood! Came here the week it opened to beat the rush and I'm so glad I did!Where it's located kinda creeps me out (I don't like to be around funeral homes, etc), but once you're inside, you'll see that the space is beautiful and modern. Taking over a previous club space, Juku has three different floors - main floor serves Izakaya, 2nd floor is the 12-seat omakase counter, and in the basement, they are currently working on a lounge/private space. Can't wait!During our visit, they had two options - a 12 piece for $80 and 15pc + handroll for $120. Seems like their website now says that the prices vary based on market pricing, so TBD I guess! To try everything, we opted for the larger omakase. To start the meal, I also got the cutest cocktail called Big Wet's Sugoiii Tiki...came in an adorable buddha shaped tiki cup haha. All the cocktails looked delicious, all paired with some kind of Japanese flavors (yuzu, sake, shiso, sesame, japanese whiskey, etc). We got the pieces below:Striped JackSoy Marinated Blue Fin TunaGolden Eye SnapperTasmanian King SalmonScallop from Hokkaido with Smoked Salt and Lemon Juice*Chopped Horse Mackerel with Ginger and Scallions (this is Chef Yoshida's favorite piece if I overheard correctly haha)Forgot to label piece #7 :(Snow CrabSeared Japanese BarracudaBaby Sardine*Botan Shrimp with Dried Fish EggSea Eel*Otoro (literally puts a piece of toro on toro :D!)Big Eye Snapper*Uni from Hokkaido*Tuna Handroll*my favorites!To end the meal, some super yummy Tamago (it's more like a sponge cake tamago...amazing), and a light yuzu sake.I like how delicate their pieces are, seasoned perfectly and with perfect rice consistency that is slightly warm. But note that these pieces are smaller than most omakase places out there (I would say probably 3/4 of the size). Forget the chopsticks, just use your hands! They actually also offer a $20 uni sampler that you can tack on at the end (5pcs of different types of uni, including a fermented one). We wanted to add it but the chef advised against it as we already got the 15pc omakase and tried the best uni they had that day already. Next time though...will perhaps try the smaller omakase combined with the uni sampler!Juku gives a lot of bang for your buck at this price point in NYC, so take advantage :) They are available for reservations under Resy. Thanks to Chef Kei for an amazing meal! **Doesn't seem like either of the chefs are involved with 1OR8 anymore (I don't even think they serve omakase anymore!).",21,0.9973

Ill be the first to admit it.Before I ever stopped in to grab some goodness I knew the Donut Pub was doing something right because Ive heard more than a few people rave about this place. What appeals to me is the REAL NYC flavuh' this shop has. Its probably been around forever and the people who work here aren't hipster scum either.The actual donut I had was amazing. I went with the cronut at around 11:30PM knowing that there was a chance it might be stale but it was as fresh as it would be at any other time of the day. It was moist and fluffy and had a nice sugary glaze. I devoured it.Ignore the negative reviews on here as they seem to have been written by hipster donut snobs. Nothings wrong with this place.

233,25,9,5.0,"Two words: Vegan Mexican. I honestly wasn't sure what to expect for an all vegan Mexican restaurant. Everything I love about Mexican food is centered around meat. On top of that, Vegan alternatives can be super hit or miss. Thankfully, it was a definite hit on their part. First of all, the smell upon entering this place is absolutely mouthwatering. The staff are accommodating, welcoming and check up on you regularly which is always nice. As for the food, I was blown away. My friend and I ordered their vegan nachos and cocktails to start. I tried the Matcha y coconut (very sweet and refreshing) and my friend got their margarita (extremely sweet, but still so good). The nachos were stupid good, topped with this amazing vegan cheese, meat, and mountain of guacamole. Like, I can die happy. We both ordered fish tacos, which we weren't sure how we felt about ""vegan fish."" The fish is a cucumber-like veggie that was breaded. It was okay, but I wish I had tried something else on the menu that wasn't trying to mock fish. Overall, I cannot wait to be back.

234,16,8,5.0,"The ramen here delivers. The in-house made springy noodles with perfect texture and thickness in creamy, rich but not too heavy tonkatsu broth were exactly what I needed on this cold winter night.The veggies were balanced. The thinly sliced spring onions were delicate and did not overwhelm the broth. The two pieces of chili oil bamboo shoots were a good addition as well. The thin slices of pork added a refined feel to the dish, though I personally prefer fatty, carmelized pork chunks. The egg came out perfectly soft boiled and beautifully placed. They care about the artistry and execution of their ramen.The Brooklyn Kura was nice. It was on the sweeter side and but thoroughly enjoyable. Topped off with some hibiki whiskey, a perfect end to a perfect meal. The servers were also very friendly and easy to chat with. Loved the vibe and the experience here. My list of favorite Manhattan ramen places are now:1. Totto ramen (hearty, rich, chunky broth)2. Tonchin (for vibe + ramen + price point)3. Ippudo (refined ramen but a little too snooty and the wait is unbearable)4. Jin Ramen (not amazing, but conveniently close to my apartment!)",24,0.9977
235,21,8,5.0,"Omar's has saved my life plenty of late dinners in the office. I've found that Mediterranean food is perfect for working: light enough to keep you from feeling sleepy while substantive enough to power you through (as I don't drink coffee and will otherwise eat all of the candy to stay awake). I've only gotten delivery so I can't say what the restaurant dining experience is like but my food's always been on time and kept relatively warm. My go-to orders:- Eggplant salad with extra pita bread. There's a fair amount of lemon and tahini, just the way I like it. - Vegetarian platter. There's usually way too much food for one sitting and for one person but even if I inhale the whole thing, I don't feel absolutely disgusting. It's $13 for about two meals' worth of food - you get falafel, hummus, baba ganoush, and pita bread. Their hummus is one of the best I've ever had. - Chicken shawarma. I was a little suspicious that the chicken would be dry and tough after I forgot about my order and left it sitting for half an hour but it turned out delicious. They give you a heaping mountain of meat. - Baklava. A small piece complimentary with each order! Such a nice touch and it never fails to make me smile. - This one hot sauce they have.

237,13,9,5.0,"FIRST REVIEW OF 2018!This was the perf meal to kickstart the weekend off the NYC ""bomb cyclone"" aka stay-burrowed-in-my-apt-under-seven-different-blankets. Despite the frigid weather and the below zero wind chills, The Noodle Bar was worth the trek down to TriBeCa!The Noodle Bar isn't reaaaaaally a speakeasy as it's pretty easy to find inside Brushstroke: just take a right when you walk through the doors. The space is very minimalist and has soft ambient lighting so it was super relaxing. The bar area seats 8, so we had to wait about 20 mins for our party of 4. There is a small waiting area right outside so it wasn't too bad, except for the draft we felt every time someone opened the door - but I digress!Once we were seated, we decided to order:- Two of the Miyazaki Wagyu Gyoza ($5 for 3 pcs): PERFECTION. Soooo delish and melt in your mouth. Make sure you use a spoon so you don't lose any of the yummy soup.- Two of the Scallop Mushroom Gyoza ($5 for 3 pcs): Wasn't my fave but good to try.- Brushstroke Tonkotsu Ramen ($17): SO good. Perfect broth - not overly salty - coupled with thin noodles (prefer wavy, but these were silky smooth), and the most delectable 3 pieces of porky perfection. Hubs got the same ramen as me, but our two (more adventurous) friends ordered the Duck Miso and the Roasted Sweet Corn Butter Soy. The corn ramen was OFF. THE. CHAIN. I swear the flavors deepened in complexity as you ate the dish...PLUS, wavy noodles y'all! Would def return for this. Throughout the evening, there was a steady wait of around 2-4 ppl. Not sure if this is the norm because it was just TOO cold out - but not too bad of a wait if you find yourself here on a Friday evening!Such a yummy way to kick NYC winter in the behind.

I was greeted cheerfully by Dani at the Front Desk, the main liaison for scheduling and rescheduling my appointments. After being greeted by Dani, Yasmine, the owner of Uplift Spa, came to the front to greet me too. Both offered a very nice welcome and were a delight to chat with throughout my visit. There were no shortcomings to the hospitality. After completing the obligatory short questionnaire, I was brought to the treatment room by my technician Alexa. The room played to all of my senses by being clean and dimly lit, there was also a soothing aroma and tranquil spa music playing in the background...this setting was what I was looking for. By sense of touch, Alexa worked wonders on my Brightening Facial. She also had a calm demeanor and was informative and pleasant to talk to. All necessary senses were satisfied and had me relaxed during my entire visit, I couldn't have asked for anything more. Except one more thing, with the 50 min Facial completed, Alexa had my face left with that natural glow. Uplift Spa is on another level and brings a spirit of diversity to Spanish Harlem. It was truly worth the visit and if scheduling allows, I would no doubt go back to support this oasis smack dab in the middle of El Barrio. I strongly recommend and thank Taiyyab for recommending.

241,23,14,5.0,"TL;DR (and a mandate) - I had one of the most delicious meals of 2017 at Root & Bone this past weekend. You MUST go and order the biscuits, the fried chicken, the squash and the collard greens.Your belly will thank you and your taste buds will have a party.- Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits: These were soft and buttery on the inside with that crumbly and golden texture on the outside. I am a biscuit fiend, and I could order 3 more dishes of this and go to town. - Squash Salad: Ummm, pickled garlic vinaigrette, lemon AND guajillo pepper? YES PLEASE. This combination is BOMB. Not only do you get that satisfaction you can't get from anything else but garlic, but you also get the spice from the pepper and the acid from the lemon. The squash is such a perfect vehicle to soak up all those juices. I mean, I am salivating over squash here. It is THAT good. - Root & Bone fried chicken: We ordered the half-chicken. It came with one leg, one thigh, one breast and one wing. Absolutely juicy - the long hours of care by that sweet tea brine definitely shows. I was blown away by how all that juicy chicken could be encased in the most perfectly crispy breading. It's more oven-baked than fried, but just as satisfying. I loved the spices in it (lemon and spiked tobasco honey) to give it a tangy, sweet and spicy balance. Korean fried chicken is my favorite type of chicken, but this one actually nudges it out! - Collard Greens with bacon, chipotle & cider vinegar. Yes, you guessed it - best collard greens I have ever had. I usually find collard greens to be one-note and uneventful, but this was a bright dish that complemented every other dish.I plan on returning many times over and bringing my out-of-town guests here for such a delicious meal!FYI - my fiance and I are big foodies and have big appetites, but the above 4 dishes definitely put me in a food coma not long after!",29,0.9977

The bacon flight is great for sharing, salads and portions are substantial. The more you share the more dishes you can try. I would suggest getting an entree to share and some appetizers. It is easy to get bacon'd out in this place but there are hearty and lighter options. The cocktails with bacon infused are subtle, no need to fear! Chef/Owner of the restaurant worked grew up in New York City and worked with Joel Robuchon, David Boule, the Four Season's Hotel among others. Which is clear when you dig into the details.

247,19,14,5.0,"If you want to cradle your face in the sensation of silk, and pamper your senses with luxurious essential oils such as pettigrain and rose, then make certain you try the new skincare line here. I wouldn't have thought that The White Company, known for its high end luxury linens and homeware, could have introduced a skin care line that would marry affordability and performance. But pairing with the powerhouse Deciem, known in the U.K. for its advanced technology in skincare, proved to be a smart investment for The White Company and the consumer. The packaging is simple and clean, with only five items that work for all skin types. Of course not every product is perfect for every type of skin; but as an example, there is certainly one product of the five than can work for even very acneic skin, such as the Eye Revitalize. I'll give a brief review of the items in the five star line. The cleanser is a creamy one that becomes oil as you massage it in, leaving the skin clean without stripping your natural oils. It doubles as a makeup remover too. The aroma is gorgeous, a mix of several essential oils including bergamot, bitter orange oil and rose and vetiver. Inhale deeply, for the fragrance is just faintly evocative enough to tease you to serenity, and not overpowering all. Women and men can embrace this line, without transforming into a heavily perfumed granny from the1920's. The serum is chock full of good stuff, like grape stem cells, amino acids, hyaluronic acids. I smeared this serum over my forehead and could have sworn that my face had an instant facelift; it plumped my forehead up so much the eyebrow area got lifted. Yes, I did use a generous amount, but I hadn't expected to be this pleasantly surprised by the effects. And the plus, you can use this over the eye area too. Want an eye cream but afraid of heavy globs clogging up the under eye area? This eye cream has the consistency of a gel, and penetrates quickly. If your skin is on the drier or normal side, by all means buy the Night Oil. It was one of my faves, the lightest face oil I've ever used, and scented with what I thought was neroli. They told me pettigrain. They're from different part of the same plant, by the way, Citrus Auruntium, or the bitter orange. The pretty scent is also a stress buster. I have dry skin and the oil was so smooth upon application it felt as if my fingers were ice skating over my skin.  I could smell and smooth it on my skin day and night. If your skin is dry, I suggest you do. And lastly is the Advanced Hydration, a moisturizer that rebalances your skin. All the textures are light, as if your fingers are skimming velvet and silk when you apply the products. And the great thing and true surprise about it all? Besides being non animal tested(VERY important to me), and made without parabens, nothing in the line is over $50, if I remember correctly. They source directly, and saving middleman expenses means the consumer saves. They keep the packaging simple, so you're not paying for that expensive container. So nestled in the high end and higher priced products of this company is a well priced skin care line that the average person can afford and should definitely try. I haven't been this excited about a skin care line in a while.The store is absolutely beautiful, with different sections showcasing different bed and bath items like fluffy chenille pillows, robes you want to never take off, other types of clothing, like dresses and cashmere sweaters. Being a tactile person, I restrained myself, but the hand feel of everything here tempts you to touch and squeeze.They have scented candles, body lotions, towels etc. White is the theme here, so you'll find white plates, cups etc. It's called the White Company, folks! White linens are of course what The White Company started out with and you'll find plenty of white sheets, some with delicate grey embroidery you could sigh over. Cover your bed with some of the sheets and duvets and you might never leave it, as you dream of finding your Sugar Daddy or Sugar Momma. If you're already making the big bucks to afford this stuff, call in sick and do a sleepover.  The salespeople here are gracious without being intrusive. They won't stalk you until you buy. I actually spoke to the owner, Chrissie, and Jessica, the manager, both so warm I was inspired to give them a terrific Yelp review after using the products and realizing they work(no Yelpers, I wasn't bribed--not with sheets or what I can't resist, chocolate!) They didn't have packaged samples of the skin care line when I was in, but do have little jars they can pump from the testers to give you. I was told they do Christmas in a big way here, so do come by around for holiday cheer. I'm not expecting to see Baby Jesus swaddled in a down duvet, but perhaps song and mead? It's for certain you can find nice skin care products here, amongst other lovely items! And your presents will not be re-gifted, I guarantee you.",30,0.9992

I learned of Taiyak through Yelp with their week-long BOGO event and since I've never been lucky enough to try a Croyaki, my intrigue superceded my growing waistline and I decided to make up for my overindulgences the following day in the gym and give into my momentary satisfaction with some custard filled fish-shaped croissants.When we pulled up, I was worried because they were packed but upon closer inspection, realised everyone inside was already enjoying their tasty treats. Upon entry, the very pleasant staff explained how the BOGO deal worked and we each ordered one of each Croyaki, one custard and one red bean. I also indulged in a Red Bean and Matcha Ice Cream for the drive home.All. The. Yums. The Croyaki is warm and crusty on the outside with a creamy pocket of slightly sweet custard inside. It is soooo good! Simple but tasty. My matcha ice cream was creamy also. It tasted just like a green tea kit kat and the strawberry drizzle on top is a perfect addition and then when you've finished the ice cream there's a red bean treat at the bottom of your fish-shaped cone.

Believe me when I say I have never had a bad crepe from here and I have pretty much tried most of them all. Every crepe I have had has always been delicious from the first to the last bite.The staff is very pleasant and they provide speedy service which is a plus. The prices are pretty decent as well. However, it is a little unfortunate that there are only just a few seats (like 4ish). I also pray that one day they will take card because the whole 'cash only' thing gets a little annoying. Most time than others I never have cash on me and usually end up paying for my crepe with all the coins I scrape up from my car and the bottom of my purse.",22,0.9799
252,18,8,5.0,"Possibly the best new Broadway show of the season. The music is haunting, at times enchanting, and the performances captivating and touching. Katrina Lenk, the female lead, is a true talent--gifted. She was wonderful recently in the play ""Indecent."" (Seems that getting to play the part of a Jewish girl is her regular gig). Her performance of ""Omar Sharif"" is captivating, elevating the song to a domain beyond the composition itself. There is no dancing in this play, but her body movement is as if it is choreographed. You also get to see Tony Shalhoub, who is endearing (isn't he always?). No one could play his role as well. The stage sets are deceptively simple but clever, and evoke a mood that works well with the narrative. The musical is based on a 2007 Israeli film of the same name. An Egyptian Police Band mistakenly winds up in a small, middle of nowhere, Negev desert village instead of a larger similar sounding town where they were going to perform. With no transportation until the next day, they spend the night with the locals. The Times review says it all: ""A Ravishing Musical That Whispers Romance."" You would never guess it from the storyline, but it really is about romance. I pick my Broadway shows carefully and I'm glad that I chose to see this one. You'll love the score, the musicians and the other performers are great.",22,0.9908
253,16,9,5.0,"Ugh. Just so delicious.In NYC there are always so many new hyped up restaurants popping up all the time, it's difficult to decipher which ones are actually worth going to. I'm always skeptical of celebrity restaurants because they are generally invariably disappointing. However, I'm a big fan of JG's other restaurants (ABC Kitchen/Cocina, Perry St) and so I wanted to give Public Kitchen a try. We came here for brunch - and I was very pleased! Space is bright, airy and very trendy in the back of a hotel with surrounding gardens. We ordered the basil/corn gyoza, smoked salmon latkes, and the black truffle pizza.Complimentary bread - stiff and flavorless. That's okay though, bread can be a huge plus but is not a dealbreaker for me.Basil/corn gyoza - delish. Usually I am against ordering vegetarian dishes (tbh, I kind of hate vegetables) but this was worth it! Delicious and surprising, the best combination of flavors.Smoked salmon latkes - tasty, but nothing special. Basically, tasted exactly how you might imagine. Given the price, dishes have gotta be at least a little bit special. Would not order again.Black truffle pizza - yes, yes, a thousand times yes! A thick cheesy chewy truffle-y gooey (mm runny egg) type of pizza - so, not for the thin crust purists. Warm and delicious. Perfect for breakfast. Large portion. Reasonably priced for NYC. Reservations needed. Service was quite slow, however - waited a long time for the food to come out, and had to flag waiters down multiple times to get water, the check, etc. Still, given the food, ambiance, and relative value, I would definitely recommend. JG has done it again!",14,0.9915

So success on what they claim to do.We tried the Original Bouncy, done in a steam bath for its signature soft and fluffy texture. It's delicate and crumbles nicely due to its high water content. They don't taste particularly different from others I've had, bearing close resemblance in the Asian stratosphere to Taiwanese cheesecake and/or cotton cheesecake.Keki's is still extremely addictive, and probably just as unforgiving calorically.

A lot of cocktail, sake options. Favorite pieces were torched toro, botan shrimp, wagyuni (of course) and the handroll add-ons. Overall fish was very very fresh and texture was amazing. No soy sauce needed as the pieces come with appropriate sauces. Our sushi chef was cordial and careful in explaining all the pieces we tried. Dinosaur and I were contemplating whether we should spoil ourselves extra by ordering handrolls and we are SOOO glad we did! We tried the toro and hamachi and both were very good. Definitely would visit again. For the price and quality, you cannot get a better deal especially in the city! Located in the basement of Sanctuary Hotel on 47th street.

We tried to book online and call ahead on the day of, but they said to just show up.I came in around 1:30 on Sunday and was told a 15-30 minute wait; the guy was kind of vague and apathetic. The place was pretty busy. However, he said we could sit at the bar, which we did once his family arrived 10 minutes later.The bartender was super helpful and explained that we could order our food at the bar and get it moved to our table as long as we closed out there. We put in our seafood orders and started with a round of a dozen and a half happy hour oysters. (Happy hour runs all day on Sunday, and includes dollar oysters!) These are not the most knock-your-socks-off oysters of your life, but they were balanced and juicy. I'm kind of picky about my oysters and I would have kept eating these forever. Big crowd pleasers.Our table was ready after about 15 minutes, so we closed out and switched over. Then we got our bibs and gloves and suited up. Our food came out in about 5 minutes.My boyfriend and I focused on the king crab legs (MP, I think it was $30something a pound) in mild lemon pepper. Awesome. The snow crab legs ($23) and shrimp ($15) were also good, in medium Claw Daddy's Special. Both of them came with potatoes and corn in the bag. We also had a round of clams ($15) that were pretty good, as well as crab cake fritters ($9) that were much better than expected. Garlic noodles ($6) are not what I expect at a Cajun spot, but they were tasty and would be a welcome addition if you're trying to fill up.They warn you about the spice here, but even the medium I tried wasn't very spicy. The king crab was our best choice, as well as the medium Claw Daddy's Special sauce. Do note that they don't serve crawfish in December.The only other seafood boil spot I've been to in New York was Hot n Juicy, which had slightly better sauces. However, the atmosphere is just so far ahead at Claw Daddy's-- you're in a modern, light filled space, and it feels much more fun than being in a basement sports bar. Service was excellent. Bathrooms were clean.If you're looking to eat a lot of seafood, Claw Daddy's is a great choice. Do reserve if you can, and do try to take advantage of the happy hour.",18,0.9985

The majority of the space is filled with a hodgepodge of games that include shuffleboard, pool, and ping pong; on weekdays, games are $6/hour per person (on weekends it is $7/hour per person). Board games go $1 per game. Not only can you have tons of fun, but the cherry on top are no doubt the live music shows. The band area is surrounded by vintage velvety and moody sofas, perfect for chilling with a cool beer. My friends and I had the pleasure of hearing a jazz ensemble on Thursday night and were thoroughly entranced by the ambiance. Pool tables are in fairly good condition, with a select amount of nice cue sticks lined across the walls. Tables are reserved via ticket numbers; I'd highly recommend getting your ticket as soon as you come in, as we ended up waiting a while before our pool table was available. In all, a wonderful place to go for a casual drink and a game of pool or ping pong. I'll definitely be back.",19,0.9907

261,25,11,5.0,"I first stumbled into Char Sue several weeks prior, and had the chance to sample an array of their small plates and appetizers - which are ideal for any happy hour get together. I can still remember how flavorful and well-encased in an egg roll shell the Black Pepper Beef Tacos were and the seasoning and spice that were layered in the Five Spice Duck Wings... Needless to say, when the opportunity came to revisit Char Sue for a five course dinner menu, I immediately said yes.The restaurant is conveniently located just steps away from the Delancey-Essex stop in the LES, and is set up for diners and groups of all sizes. Looking to just grab a quick bite? Take a seat at the bar or one of the two tops to the side. Hoping to have a group of friends and family? There's a communal table that'll seat everyone at once as well. It works for almost any occasion, and the food alone is deserving of a special visit.Dinner began with a new menu addition: Monkey Bread served a top a slice of sweet potato in a Thai Green Curry. The bread is a family recipe, compliments of Chef Matty Rojas, and is soft and pillowy with no small amount of butter - perfect for getting that slight crisp at the bottom of the bed. It's the perfect vehicle for scooping up the spicy and creamy curry, and contrasts well with the sweetness of the sweet potato. The following dish isn't, unfortunately, on the permanent menu, but if I had my way - it would be. Tender, succulent slices of octopus were served with charred brussels sprouts and paired with a spicy pennywort vinaigrette. The flavors were reminiscent of the Yu Xiang (鱼香) sauce that I've grown up eating, and was the perfect savory-spicy flavor for the protein.Next up: Crispy. Pork. Belly. No other words are really necessary, but I did my best to savor each of the three pieces that were served; they had a crisp, crunchy crust that yielded to a tender and fatty interior, and was highlighted even more with the side of a garlic-chili dipping sauce. It ties with the Char Sue Duck as my favorite dish of the night, but how can you compare to a plate of decadent dry-aged roast duck coated in a blend of Sichuan spices? A crisp, crackling skin, tender and juicy white meat, all served a top of bed of warm sushi rice... this would easily be my last meal (if I ever had to choose one) and is more than successful as a modern, elevated take on the traditional Peking duck.To finish, a sweet almond pudding with a strawberry jam provided the ideal light finish to the meal... and also cemented my desire to camp outside their kitchens for the remainder of my time. (You think I'm joking. I'm not.)I'm already planning a return visit to Char Sue, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a uniquely NYC restaurant. Here, Asian food is redone and reinvented to even better and more delicious forms, but still stay true to their core flavors and tastes - and truly, you won't find these dishes anywhere else.",40,0.9978

We each had a glass of wine selected by our server and Julie ordered a corpse reviver II after seeing a selection of Absinthe based cocktails. She said it was the best she has had in New York. We just had wines by the glass, but the wine list looked pretty good with lots of bottles under $75.00. Julie had moules as an appetizer.

Provided a good amount of surprise heat that normally doesn't come with a caprese. Burrata - Similar to the caprese but more simple. Just the burrata, basil and tomato with some EVOO. Simple, classic.Tagliolini ai funghi - Truffley for sure! This is more of an oil-based sauce pasta with plenty of mushrooms in it. The pasta was plentiful and cooked perfectly al dente. You can tell that all the pastas are freshly made which is the number 1 thing I look for in any legit Italian restaurant. For the price and quantity, the pasta dishes are so worth it. I tried a couple of the other pasta dishes and all were just so fresh and well-flavored. LOVED IT. Ricotta cheesecake - OMG OMG OMG. We weren't going to get it because we were so full after our delicious pastas but the waiter highly highly highly advised it. This cheesecake is reputable across the nation and he talked us into it. Sure, why not? I am sure it will be good. NO! IT WAS AMAZING!! I have never tasted a cheesecake like this. It was the creamiest cheesecake I have ever tasted and the ricotta elevated it to top notch. Have you ever seen the episode in FRIENDS where Chandler and Rachel steal cheesecake from a neighbor and end up eating cheesecake off the floor because it was just too good? That was what popped into my head when I took my first bite. This is the type of cheesecake I would steal and eat off the floor if I had to. Do not pass on this cheesecake! Trust me. Overall, everything was so good. I have to go back. I will go back. Pasta, cheese and three slices of ricotta cheesecake please and thank you!",29,0.9993

The prices may seem high at first but it comes with unlimited sangria so it is actually a very good deal!!!When coming into this hotel restaurant it has a nice dimly lit ambience and with a lot of tables. When we sat down we ordered drinks right away and I am not going to review all of them because they are all delicious. The one I will mention is the HAVANA BANANA Coconut Rum, Crème de Banana, Coconut, Lychees this just had so many unique sweet flavors they make it definitely worth getting. The drinks do stop once you stop ordering/eating food so make sure to order a desert for the table at the end ;) to keep them flowing.From a food standpoint I would recommend the Gallitos (serves two)Platter of Traditional Costa Rican Soft Tacos, Scrambled Eggs, Chorizo, lettuce, pico de gallo, avocado salad, Calle Ocho Home Fries. It was all delicious especially the chorizo and this gives you really everything from a food standpoint and solid portion for two people.

My friend scored a 7pm Sunday seating and the experience from start to finish was amazing. We opted for the 12 piece omakase meal for $75. They also offer a 16 piece omakase meal for $100 if you're feeling hungry for it. Both seatings are 1.5hrs and start exactly on time so don't be late. the master chef was an adorable old man who was very knowledgeable and friendly. Every piece he made was delicious, fresh, and flavorful.

279,24,20,5.0,"I'm definitely not a steakhouse connoisseur by any means - I know the greats (Luger's, Wolfgang's, Smith and Wollensky) but that's only because everyone knows those names. I'm pretty sure I couldn't tell you the difference between a prime rib at Capital Grille versus the same cut at Wolfgang's. My boyfriend, on the other hand, loves his meat. There's nothing that lights up his face more than cutting into a bloody slab (absolutely nothing, including me). So for his birthday this year, I picked Keen's. The reviews looked good, the prices were on the margin of affordable for a steakhouse, and the neat New York past spoke to my inner history nerd. Hello, 50,000 clay pipes stacked precariously along the ceilings? The famous mutton chop devoured by Lillie Langtry who took Keen's to court for not admitting women? Yes, please. First, there are several different parts of Keen's. We accidentally came in through the bar entrance and wandered confusedly until we finally came to the main waiting area. There's a first floor, second floor, and third floor. Tables and groups of all sizes. Second, a reservation is definitely a must for weekend dinners. We came on the earlier side and by the time we left there was already a line. Third, everything we ordered was amazing. They give you free bread and crudite/dip: the bread, while not the best house bread, was at least toasted. My boyfriend got the prime rib, I got the lobster salad, and we ordered the creamed spinach, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes to share. Now, let me be clear. That prime rib was heavenly. Even better than my lobster salad. It needed no salt or steak sauce. (While I'm on the topic of salt, Keen's includes a blurb on the menu that says you can ask them to tweak the salt level but only for certain dishes.) It came with a garlic and horseradish sauce but I preferred the meat without. The bliss on my boyfriend's face was over 9,000 at this point. Holy crap, the sides. I was a bit skeptical about the creamed spinach but that was the one I ended up liking the most. Mashed potatoes were fine. Sautéed mushrooms came out a little too oily but I ate embarrassing portions of it nonetheless. Even though we were hurting at this point, we ordered the butterscotch sundae. We practically cleaned the bowl and then waddled out of there, clutching our bellies. Definitely a fantastic meal to combat the Sunday scaries.Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and cheerfully promised to bring out a candle with the dessert.",39,0.9927

We were guided to the second dining area that complimented the first, but with white table clothed tables, intimate candle lit settings, rounded out with piped in, smooth jazz type vocals cooing remakes of modern pop tunes. Our server, Joseph, pulled out his patience hat for the evening as he tried on several occasions to get us to order our courses timely. We had so much catching up to do, but finally took a moment to peruse our menus and start with our apps. I had the soup of the day, which was a comfortingly smooth Cauliflower soup. Mercedes's Eggplant Timbale with a thinly veiled béchamel sauce was unexpectedly fragrant and hearty.I followed Mercedes's lead, as I wasn't in the mood for a heavy pasta or meat dish. So I ordered the perfectly seared, medium rare salmon atop spaghetti squash, dotted with lightly seared grape tomatoes. The salmon glistened and had a huge punch of buttery flavors.

On the one hand, it offers one of the best meat tacos I have ever tasted (other being Velvet Taco in Chicago), but the crowds at Chelsea Market are always insane. I prefer to eat in a leisurely fashion and enjoy my food with good company, rather than hunching over one tiny little space as hundreds of people rush past or gawk at you to finish faster so they can grab your space.Now, I know that the pace of this new location might be due to how new it is to the location, but I love the ambiance here! The tacos are just as good (you MUST get the carne asada and adobada), but the pace is much more relaxed. The music is bomb and fun. The sauces just as ample (mild, medium, and spicy). Don't forget to add everything to your tacos (guac, onions, sauce, and cilantro). If you decide to add the spicy sauces to your tacos, you can alleviate the fire bomb in your mouth by drinking their delicious offering horchata.I gorged last time and got 3 tacos (my fiance got 5)!

Cara too is just as awesome.The bar area and outdoor patio was clean as well as the bathroom which seems to be something people mention when reviewing this place. The bar itself was decorated nicely and kept dimly lit. One major plus here is their awesome jukebox. The jukebox here has mixes from various famous NYC bars Abby has tended and has a little bit of everything ranging from punk to alternative and everything in between.One thing that will bring me back for sure is the non pretentious attitude here.

I wanted to be allowed to return each year. There's a beach. I can't remember swimming there. I enjoyed the rides. The Dragon Coaster and Fun House especially. We always found lots of junk food to eat. It was a highlight of the summer. I couldn't wait to return. I even have photos of my Mother at Playland before she got married. It's great to pass Memories of a historic amusement park down to future generations. My daughter always went when she visited Connecticut in summer. If you get a chance visit this piece of history.

Repeat the next day.------------------------------------------------------If you haven't noticed, there's been a seismic shift in the Chinese culinary scene in Manhattan. For years I've had to make a tough choice between pleasing my taste buds or my eyes. When coworkers asked for recommendations I struggled to think of a single name that would score high on all three metrics--authenticity, decor, and service. Alas, we cannot have it all. Or so I thought. Enter mega-wealthy Chinese restaurateurs and investors loaded with cash money. This wealth is not only flooding the investments market but also penetrating the culinary scene. Several new restaurants backed by big names are slated to open in 2017, and these are imports straight from the motherland so are guaranteed to be good. Finally, New Yorkers will discover what Chinese food is actually like in China. All rejoice! Let's take a moment to think about how fat we're gonna get. Ok, good. Now, Sichuan Mountain House has already generated a significant following in Flushing. It made its debut in Saint Mark's Place last week and I just had to see it myself. The Chinese name, which has much more character, references a rather curious nocturnal animal with poor vision but a great sense of smell [1]. I can imagine all the dinners turning into pangolins as soon as they enter, tuning into the deliciously spicy aroma of chili peppers. The owners want to ""create an atmosphere that is just like a little house in the Szechuan province."" Boy did they do a good job. The interior transports me into an episode of Wu Lin Wai Zhuan. The service is impeccable. As for the food, I don't see a need to elaborate, other than subtly suggesting that your ENTIRE OUTLOOK ON LIFE will be improved.  Out of the 10 or so dishes we tried, these especially stood out:- Sliced pork belly with chili garlic soy: their signature dish. Literal translation: white meat draped over a clothing line. - Steamed crab with sticky rice: the sticky rice was perfectly cooked and having soaked in all the flavors of the crab meat, simply delicious. I could eat three bowls of this. - Fish fillet with pickled mustard green: the broth was reduced to a white, creamy consistency that is making me salivate as I'm thinking about it now. The mushrooms were very fresh. - Fried rice with pineapple: I usually try to stay as far away from fried rice as possible, but this dish cast fried rice in a whole new light. The pineapples were slightly tart and sweet, lighting up the rice and seafood. - A note on the tea: the complimentary tea is seriously good. It's not that moldy three-day old stuff restaurants forget to refresh. Given the aroma I suspect it is Tie Guan Yin. It's cleansing and a perfect foil for all the spicy dishes. Thumbs up on choice of tea.I expect Sichuan Mountain House to go far, and it will be more than deserving of whatever status it achieves. [1] A shortlist of new restaurants slated for 2017 Manhattan openings:- DaDong, the original Beijing roast duck. They announced a November opening and was immediately booked straight through December. Holy. Bananas. - Dalongyi, Sichuan-style hotpot - Dou Lao Fang (The Dolar Shop), Cantonese style hotpot[2] According to Wikipedia, ""Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin, and they are the only known mammals with this feature. They live in hollow trees or burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins are nocturnal, and their diet consists of mainly ants and termites which they capture using their long tongues. They tend to be solitary animals, meeting only to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring which are raised for about two years. Pangolins are threatened by hunting (for their meat and scales) and heavy deforestation of their natural habitats, and are the most trafficked mammals in the world.""

They told me that they were aiming to incorporate their Asian-American culture into the Stax ice cream experience- and they certainly succeeded. Fortunately, the staff was patient enough to cater to my indecisiveness by providing samples of every flavor behind the counter. All of the ice cream was thick and rich with flavor. I was lured in with their range of tea flavored ice cream- earl grey, jasmine milk and of course a bright green matcha. Contrasting to the tea, I loved their truly authentic American flavors such as - 'orange dreamsicle', 'fruity pebbles', 'snickerdoodle', 's'mores', and 'cornflake bourbon'(which was my favorite). I expect to see a surge of young instagrammers 'boomeranging' their signature pressed donut ice cream sandwich.

After having existed since 1888, Katz's proves that it can still power on, and even though it gets criticized for being too touristy, it proves that it is indeed something special by virtue of having survived so long.I came in on a Tuesday this year at 9:30, thinking it would be relatively empty- instead I found it was actually quite crowded. I splurged a little bit this time and finally tried the Italian bread (it's $1 extra)You know, considering the prices here, it might actually make sense to lose your ticket. I by myself managed to consume $32 dollars worth of food by myself- just another $18 more to break even (losing your ticket poses a fine of $50). The prices are high, yes, but perhaps not unjustified; it's what people are willing to pay. In a town like New York too, where I think we have relatively good hot pastrami, the market should be quite competitive, so they deserve credit.Pastrami and smoked meats don't have the same elegance or gravitas a lot of Americans like to assign things like Sushi, probably due to all these ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"" type things floating around, but to make a pastrami joint as successful as Katz's, you have to be equally dedicated to your craft, especially so since there are so many haters.

So don't waste your time reading this if that's your thing. True, they do have ice cream sushi here but that's not what I like about this place. I do eat lots of gimmicky ice cream but except for some of the Asian stuff (Japanese taiyaki, Thai rolled, etc.), I really don't go for the American junk food ideas.

What the heck is that supposed to have as a flavor anyways? Yes, presentation is great, but taste comes first.All the ice cream here has simple natural ingredients that are often sourced directly from Italy - milk, cream, hazelnuts, pistachios, lemons, etc. The owner is from Turin and most of the key ingredients also come from the same Piemonte region in Italy. So how come farm to table hasn't reached ice cream yet? Seems stuck in a junk food trend rut. Why not compete with Italian ice cream by creating our own fresh unique & local ingredients?!? Like with trendy kale & brussel sprouts - let's do 'local' ice cream flavors like lime, grapefruit, bourbon, mezcal butternut squash, avocado, cranberry, sweet corn, etc. Anyways. Just my 2 cents.",30,0.99
302,20,13,5.0,"I have walked passed the restaurant countless times and have noticed the cute outdoor seating area. However, it wasn't until yesterday that I had the opportunity to eat at this restaurant when I was invited to come in for a complimentary dinner and see the true charm of the restaurant. (Disclaimer: this review represents my own unbiased opinion)To start off, I had both the Capri Rinha and the Go-To cocktails and they were both strong and delicious.For appetizers, I tried both the Fritto Misto and the Cozze in Padella. The Fritto Misto was comprised of fried calamari as well as two pieces of fried shrimp and two pieces of fried artichoke hearts. They were lightly battered and perfectly fried with no greasy residual left over. The Cozze in Padella (steamed PEI mussels) was plentiful and thoroughly cleaned. Although I'm not a big fan of mussels, I couldn't stop eating because the broth was irresistible. The waitress was even kind enough to offer us more bread when she saw me sharing with my friend.Since their pastas are all homemade, I decided to order the Linguine Nere Alla Sarde for my entree. The squid ink pasta had an abundance of seafood and potatoes. I truly loved this dish. Even my dinner companion who didn't like the squid ink pasta at another restaurant ended up raving about this dish. There were also hints of chili flakes which gave the dish a nice little kick. My friend got the Bistecca Alla Griglia which was a hefty portion of the NY strip steak. I was very surprised at how good this dish was, especially since we were at a Italian restaurant. It was cooked quite nicely and seasoned perfectly. The steak went very well with the arugula salad on the side and fried potatoes. To finish up our meal, we ordered both the tiramisu as well as three scoops of gelato. The gelato was already melting by the time it got to us and the tiramisu was beautifully presented but the taste was disappointing to say the least.Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant. Our waitress was attentive and very friendly and welcoming. Our drinks, appetizers and entrees were all delicious but I would probably skip the desserts next time!",24,0.9924
303,21,12,5.0,"One of the prettiest and cleanest stations in NYC definitely deserves 5 stars. It's as if the dinosaur fossil impressions on the lower level have scared away the rats. Or perhaps they find better pickings at the nearby Central Park. I suspect that being the main station leading to a top tourist attraction, the Museum of Natural History, has forced MTA to put this station tops on its A list of stations to keep clean. Whatever the reason, this station is a joy to stop in, with the colorful animal mosaics on the top level such a delight for the eyes. Just be prepared for the stampede of tourists and school kids, as they unload from the trains and get ready to visit the museum, so only artwork and not your trodden remains decorate the floors.",25,0.9686

Great natural lighting and very spacious with table and couch seating options.The service just couldn't be better either. Pierre (the owner), who also has a Lena location on W 8th near Washington Square Park, made us feel so welcome and served up great coffee and warm muffins (which he baked himself!).Protips: They also serve WINE and BEER and the space is great for events.I love to see local businesses pop up and do well and I'm happy to see Lena bringing such a positive presence to the neighborhood.

305,13,7,5.0,"In a city full of great cafes and restaurants, why is Fiat Cafe the first place I think of when I come back to NYC after being away? It could be that Anna, the daytime server, makes you feel like a returning friend, not just another customer. It might be that I like that the place evokes memories of simple cafes in a Roman neighborhood or some small Italian village. But these things wouldn't matter, if the food did not so consistently exceed expectations. Here's an example. Lunch yesterday (9/22/17). I ordered Avocado Toast with Scrambled Egg Whites (extra $1.50) on Whole Grain Bread. Greens with a touch of vinaigrette came as a side. I put some salt and bit of Tabasco on. The eggs weren't rubbery, like most scrambled. They were light, like a soufflé in texture and like cumulous clouds in appearance. The avocado was copious and warm. The bread was crunchy. Something so simple done well. That kind of sums up what I like about Fiat Cafe.I first came here to have breakfast on weekends while my wife slept late. Since she started coming with me for lunch, it's pretty much our weekend lunch spot. I highly recommend any pasta, the fish soup, any omelette and any desert. The chocolate ganache and panna cotta need to be tasted, they're beyond what words can describe. My original review is below. Time and revisits have only reinforced my original impressions.I basically described it as a funky little cafe on Mott Street, with minimal effort at trendy decor, hardly any kitchen space and where they don't take credit cards. It reminds me of what downtown was like before it got gentrified. I love the place. The most expensive design element here is their neon sign. Come here with no expectations of a culinary masterpiece--so you'll be surprised that some things so uncomplicated can be so good. Sit and enjoy your coffee, wine, beer or prosecco. It's always calm and off the tourist radar--so far. ""Prices are reasonable. Service is good since it's only five feet from the kitchen to the tables. It's where I go once a week for a breakfast omelet--which they graciously cook to my specifications. If you look at previous Yelp reviews you can see that people either love it or hate it. As I said, I'm in the former group. But I look at dining/drinking as an experience to be appreciated in context. In this case the atmosphere enhances the experience. I can almost imagine I'm sitting in a run down cafe on a small side hstreet in Trastevere in Rome--almost.""",19,0.9953

I realized why I needed to come back here!""Spicy Spicy"" I ordered the beef with layman noodles and I told them to make it the spiciest you can possibly make it.

309,12,20,5.0,"Review may be biased because I was served by literally the most good looking waiter I'd ever seen. I don't think my friend and I were able to form coherent sentences for a few minutes.Made a reservation for 10:30 breakfast on a holiday weekend, and this place was still packed to the gills, so I'd say a reservation is a must. I'd never come here for a non-dinner meal before, so insisted on getting the famous bread basket to share in addition to main courses. Even has a carboholic, this may have been a mistake. A delicious mistake, but a mistake nonetheless. The bread basket, while pricey on first glance, was huge - way more than two people could ever possibly eat if they wanted to get out of the restaurant alive. It included a full sized (!) sticky bun, croissant, chocolate croissant, brioche, various breads, and I'm sure I'm forgetting at least one - all from their own bakery. Absolutely worth it.My main was the eggs benedict, which come with a side of home fries. I'm not normally a breakfast person, but this was probably the best rendition of the dish I've ever had. Eggs were perfectly poached, hollandaise sauce was as rich as Warren Buffett, and the home fries were on a level I didn't know non-fried potatoes could reach. Balthazar is an NYC institution for a reason (20 years and counting!), and is well worth the advanced planning required to dine here.",11,0.9893
310,13,10,5.0,"I don't have much to add to the many reviews already praising the Ube and black Sesame. In fact, those reviews lead me into choosing those two flavors.I went at a good time since there was no line and there was no pressure to hurry my order. Even though I wanted Ube and Black Sesame, I was offered a tasting of those two flavors before I pulled the trigger. I stuck with my original choice. Stupid me, I should have tried other flavors too, like Coconut and Matcha. LOLI think my ube/black sesame looked awesome and I was able to get a good shot of it in the stand. I would normally give this place 4 stars, but I don't know what it is. Whether it was the perfect weather, my empty belly, having no line to wait on and/or the pretty smiling cashier, I felt this place called for 5 stars.The only thing I could complain about and I'm starting to feel I like to bitch a lot lately, is that the ice cream melted pretty quick and I felt I had to eat it fast to prevent a puddle from forming under me. When I finished, I felt a great satisfaction of having a stomach full of very tasty ice cream. Good day.",12,0.983
311,15,12,5.0,"12 pieces, 30 minutes, $50. Plain and simple, what's there not to love? True, this place is almost identical to Sushi on Jones, but hey, you don't get Chef David Bouhadana if you go to Sushi on Jones (according to Eater, he is no longer involved with that project)! He's super animated behind the sushi counter and often interacts with his guests, posing for photos and dancing for boomerangs haha. The flavors/garnishes are also a bit different.4 counter seats in total only for Sushi by Bou, and 4 more to the side of it for Sushi by Bae, which is now served up by Oona Tempest (formerly of Tanoshi and Ginza Onodera) for a higher price of $100 per head, 15-18pcs. Text 917-870-1587 for reservations, Josh is super nice! Don't be late, as they give away your seat to walk-in's if you're more than 2 minutes late!Since it's omakase, no need to order, which makes things super simple. He does ask you for allergies or dietary restrictions before your meal starts. Everything was made super well and tasted super fresh. At first glance, I thought the rice looked a bit too loose, but when I picked it up with my hands, it held together quite well. My favorite pieces were the botan shrimp, Toro, Uni, and Scallop - all of these literally melt in your mouth and are bursting with flavor. Though the main show is pretty much always the torching of the wagyu beef and the layering of uni over it, I kinda felt like I preferred them separate / wagyu beef was a little stringy, though it had awesome flavor.If you have more time in your 30 minute slot, you can always order more a la carte, or add a wagyuni handroll for $14.Water/Tea as always is still $3 (water is Fiji), but here, you get complimentary sake!!! They come and refill your cup throughout the meal as well! Not sure if Jones does this now since I went a while ago...but this was a pleasant surprise!Would definitely come here again for some quick and relatively cheap but high quality sushi! Great place to bring a friend to if they're visiting from out of town too.**One worthy thing to note is that he no longer serves his famous Tres Amigos (uni, quail egg, ikura) here!!!

312,16,14,5.0,"I had been eyeing Pizzaniste since before they opened. While one may think this is yet another pizzeria being added to the Tremont Ave strip, the floor-to-ceiling windows which made up the exterior led me to think this was something different. Today I had the opportunity to grab lunch here with my brother and found that my suspicions were accurate. Unlike most pizzerias, at Pizzaniste you can choose from a number of individual sized pie creations or you can create your own pizza with custom toppings. I was a fan of the aesthetics. The front walls of the restaurant are able to fully extend out, and as such Pizzaniste has a very open feel to it. It's larger than most pizzerias and has a modern decor with lots of clean lines and a full view of the workstation where you can see your pie being assembled.While you can create your own pie, they have a number of them on the menu that you can choose from as well. I decided to take the latter option, and went with the spinach artichoke pizza. This was a white pizza topped with (guess what) artichokes, spinach, and ricotta. I was a fan - the pies are made to order so it was super fresh; the flavors worked really well together. Service was amazing - everyone was super friendly and eager to help; from the time we walked in we were greeted warmly and it continued up until we left. Aside from the food, it's things like this that set a business apart from others - and I need to commend them for a job well done.Overall, Pizzaniste is a great place - it's not your typical pizzeria, but it's a welcome (and arguably needed) change in this area of the Bronx which is oversaturated with pizza places. The fresh ingredients they use and killer service they provide definitely make them a 5 for me - great job guys!",21,0.9884

320,19,9,5.0,"""Street Taco"" sounds like something you'd buy on an arbitrary corner of Manhattan on a day you forgot to pack your lunch, are slammed with meetings, and need something sloppy and delicious from a food cart to forget any/all workplace woes.In reality, Street Taco is a cool restaurant with a well-curated palette of decor ranging from patterned tables reminiscent of The Shining's infamous carpet to walls paneled with oversized rustic tiles à la the remnants of Mexican masonry from the late-1800s.I'm someone who will order everything else on the menu of a Mexican restaurant before I order tacos. For example, I would one-hundred-percent order enchiladas before ordering tacos. I'd order a chimichanga (or a burrito, tamales, quesadillas, fajitas, et al) over tacos. I have absolutely nothing against tacos and my lack of desire for tacos is probably one of the most bizarre things about me.That being said, the Street Tacos tacos I sampled completely satiated my rare desire for tacos. The Gringo (ground beef, pico, crema and Monterey Jack in a hard shell) had a crunch as satisfying as the crunch of a Dorito after you've not had Doritos in years (another random food item that is delicious but--for not even one reason--I never eat). The flavors and juiciness going on in the Gringo taco are impossible to put into words.

326,24,9,5.0,"Thursday Kitchen in a nutshell: Worth the hype.Part 2 of succinct synopsis: firing on all cylinders. Service, space and ingestibles are all top-notch *and* affordable. No-brainer.Let the record show that Thursday Kitchen does not take reservations. I'm guessing that you already know this, but I want to make note of it before jumping into the meat and potatoes (read: kimchi and kale) of this review. We arrived here at 8pm on a Saturday night, so I was already expecting to be slammed with a pretty significant wait time. Initially 90 minutes, though it ended up being closer to an hour. Thankfully there's a plethora of fantastic bars in the area so it's pretty easy to entertain yourself for that long, contingent on your stomach behaving. Thursday Kitchen is a below-ground mecca of Korean-inspired tapas and drinks that facilitate consuming of said tapas. Fun for a date, even better for a group of friends. It's got a young, energetic vibe with young, energetic staff. Oddly enough, the drinks seemed to take longer to arrive than the food, but I promise they're worth the wait. The beverage program here is as playful and quirky as advertised. Served in luminescent plastic pouches, these cocktails are basically adult Capri Sun Made with soju (clear liquor, rice-based), these drinks are light but lethal. Remember the ""adult"" qualifier here. Though they may seem indistinguishable from those magical childhood beverages, these do indeed have alcohol in them. They're sweet, too, so do a bit of forecasting and don't catapult yourself into hangover city. It's a very real possibility if you're not careful. In any case, I tried the Ms. Cuteini (soju, cucumbers, bitters) and the Lychee Reach Rich (soju, lychee, mango) and both were sublime. Who needs to wait in line at Death & Co when you have these?Initially, they got our first round order wrong. We ordered three Cuteinis and one Lychee but received the swapped order. The result? Two free drinks. One of them mine. That's a place that wants you having a good time. And our server was fabulous overall. Hilarious, knowledgable and accommodating. You can tell the staff loves working here.Thursday Kitchen recommends 2-3 plates per person. I'd recommend 3--plates are on the smaller side. Because we went as a party of four, it made the most sense to eliminate what we didn't want as opposed to choose what we did. This worked out fabulously. Eats, below:Kale w/ stilton (blue cheese)-daikon vinaigrette, mung bean sprout, brussels sprout: A+Somehow, one of the best dishes of the night. Gotta be that dressing. Light and creamy. The ideal starter.Angry Sweet Potato w/ sriracha goat cheese, chilli pepper: AOnly order these if you like spice. Read carefully: sriracha *and* chili pepper. Delicious. Sriracha goat cheese is a brilliant invention. Avocado w/ greens vinaigrette, pickled radish, yuzu sour crème, shichimi pepper: ASmooth and yummy. Fresh and colorful. Other adjectives. Octopus w/ korean pear, sweet soy-scallion, riesling gellée, mango: BI'm an octo-snob (trademarking that now) so I'm picky when it comes to octopus. The preparation here was interesting but the execution fell flat. The octopus was rubbery and made the whole dish lackluster--especially relative to the rest of our queue for the night.Soft Shell Crab w/ wasabi remoulade, pickeled tomatoes: AOnly got one bite, but it was delicious. Lightly fried and that wasabi remoulade was heavenly. The tomatoes seemed irrelevant, but that's a minor complaint. Kimchi Paella w/ white tiger shrimp, mussels, caramelized kimchi: AOne of our larger (and heavier) orders. The shrimp were tasty, the mussels were just okay. The paella itself was delicious. Hard to believe it was kimchi!Tuna Tataki w/ hummus coulis, sesame vinaigrette, crunchy quinoa, serrano pepper, sumac: ALovely and light--one of our healthier dishes of the night. Varied and interesting both flavor and texture-wise.Steak w/ soy-garlic glaze, feta grits, sautéed kale: A+Probably the simplest plate we ordered both ingredient-wise and aesthetics-wise but man, what a knockout. Grits were the perfect consistency. Steak was cooked to perfection and that soy-garlic glaze made the kale yummy too. Win.Crispy Chicken w/ sweet and spicy sauce, black sesame crumbles: AFun take on fried chicken with an Asian flair. Uber flavorful and not healthy in the slightest.Chicharron w/ conft-style pork belly, cashew crème, white kimchi, lime juice, cilantro: A+Heaven. Pork belly is just decadent. Crispy, rich, flavorful and topped with some creamy/dreamy cashew cream. Fun, creative preparation. Edamame Dumpling w/ steamed, citrus truffle oil, green pepper, parmigiano: A+One of my favorite plates of the night. Hard to go wrong with this combo, but these were total flavor bombs. Truffle Mac and Cheese w/ manila clam, three cheese blend: A+Again, truffle mac was a shoe-in to be a crowd-pleaser. Having some hidden clams in there was a special treat.",28,0.9996

330,17,9,5.0,"Pinch is one of those places that is special not only because of their outstanding food, but also because of the thoughtfulness with which they approach it. The ambiance of the space is pulled together, sophisticated, and artful without being at all stuffy or pretentious. I especially love the viewing window where you can watch their artisan chefs fold all of their dumplings into beautiful shapes. Just a quick glance at their menu shows that they really know and understand their target and are hitting it perfectly. This is elevated, modern Chinese cuisine, with enough confidence to call itself that. While I'm not an expert on Chinese food, the mix of familiar dishes with ones that are harder to find is just enough to keep you from feeling neither under nor overwhelmed. There are both refined flavors and ones that pack a punch, and I wasn't the least bit disappointed with any dish that we tried. In fact, their consistency each time we've gone is one of the most impressive things about the experience. They also throw in some charming quirks, like cocktails named after the lyrics of ""Call Me Maybe."" (If you like something smoky, I especially recommend the ""This is Crazy."") Everything was also very clean, down to their bathrooms, and their staff were all very welcoming and attentive.Seafood + Pork Soup Dumplings: Their dumplings are the star of the show, no way around it. Of course, with their DTF-trained chefs, expectations are high, and they nailed it perfectly. The wrapper on the outside was sturdy with that slight chewiness that I love, and the pork/seafood broth inside is heavenly.Mushroom Dumplings: If you love the earthy flavor of mushrooms and truffles, you absolutely have to order this one. I could eat 50 of these and be perfectly happy with my life choices.Spicy Wontons: Again, the quality of the wrapper is absolutely key, and the flavor of the oils and spices in the sauce just makes you want to discreetly drink it under the table.Marinated Cucumber: Totally the unsung hero of the meal. I am addicted to the cool crunch of the cucumber and the delicately balanced flavors. It seems so simple, but when you taste it, you'll know that a lot of finesse went into this dish.Niman Ranch Cumin Ribs: The flavor on these ribs seriously blew my mind. The meat is tender and comes right off the bone, and the spices on top are phenomenal. I have never had anything like it anywhere else. Even if they didn't have dumplings, I would still come for these ribs.Three Cup Chicken: The chicken itself is properly cooked to just the right doneness, and the sauce is flavorful without making you feel like you're going past your sodium intake limit for the day. I also love the fresh herbs they throw in.Seafood Fried Rice: The rice is amazingly fluffy and punctuated by nice, big pieces of shrimp, scallop, and crab. The flavor is subtle, really relying on the naturally rich flavor of the seafood. I sound like a broken record, but this one is also a must.Overall, you can find cheap Chinese food anywhere, but from what I've seen, you can only find this level of thoughtfully curated aesthetic and experience here at Pinch.",22,0.9991

I came around 8:30pm and was told they usually close at 8pm but I was still able to get a matcha latte. The owner (I thought he was at least) was super nice and made a delicious matcha latter. With almond milk it came out to $4.90 which is really good because there's a place down the street that charges $6 which is crazy. They also use my favorite almond milk brand (the barista blend califa one). I saw they have a baked goods shelf/stand but since I was here late I didn't get to try one.

She always made sure we had the same vision and worked with me to make sure we were headed in the right direction. She also made sure I was comfortable the entire time- very sweet and professional! She also spent the time to style it afterwards and always answered any hair questions I had in general.

333,18,16,5.0,"Is it just me or did the egg tarts used to be a lot cheaper than the current $1 a pop? It's somehow stamped in my memory that, in a bygone era, they were only a quarter each and I would get four in a bag to myself, cradling the waxen paper, each tart still hot from the oven.Sometimes they have the fluorescent green egg tarts but those sell out in a jiffy. The regular egg custards are best when slightly toasted and warm - my favorite part that always ends too soon is the soft eggy middle. Here's what else I've tried (and heartily recommend):- Moon cake with the lotus seed paste and green tea mooncake. - Pineapple bun. These are SO GOOD. My HK friends taught me the traditional way to eat these: slice it in half, toast it, and then stick a thick slab of butter inside. I can't really concentrate after eating one but it's well worth the sacrifice. - Sachima. If you're Chinese, you'll know exactly what this is because chances are that your parents/grandparents/aunties have a few of these individually wrapped cellophane blocks stuck inside an empty blue Royal Dansk butter cookie bin. I basically just summed up your entire childhood. Lung moon's iteration isn't overly sweet and has just enough honey syrup. - Triangle sponge cake.

But the sushi is fresh and reminds me of Japan (My rice was falling apart a little for some of the pieces).

They have the traditional dishes here like the Channa masala, or veg biryani (wirh yogurt but can be made vegan) and some dishes I've never had before. I was ecstatic to see that they have a separate section between veg and vegan items. We had the chilli gobi to start, which is a spicy breaded cauliflower in a sweet and tangy sauce, very spicy. The red pumpkin thoran / curry is simply divine, savoury with a nice coconut flavor. It is perfect with the kadhai bindi, an okra dish, which was crispy and all sorts of yummy. The onion fritters, pakora, are nicely done. I especially enjoyed the combination of the cabbage fry with the dal (yellow lentils). Attentive service, and friendly staff. Plenty of seating, good for groups or a date. Comfy seats and delicious food, I can't ask for more.Overall, we're very pleased with the food and can't wait till our next visit.",29,0.9961

We didn't have reservations, but there were plenty of spaces as the restaurant is quite spacious. The restaurant was surprisingly not loud although it was crowded. The decor resembles a Western saloon. There is something for everyone here, a romantic indoor patio in the back (reservations highly recommended), a happening bar near the front and a relaxing and open dining area for people like me who just like dining.The food was incredibly good. We had the veal and eggplant, grilled shrimp and all-white salad. I appreciate that they use the best and freshest ingredients for each dish.

Overall fish quality is above par in the city, very fresh fish and nice variety at seasonable prices.Scallop, squid, eel, totoro, snapper and hokoiddo uni were my favorites. Every piece is fresh, sweet and flavorful with prefect amount of soy sauce/vinegar. Scallop is sweet, fatty and juicy. The squid is sweet with the soft texture like scallop. Smart move to add Yuzu peels to the sweet eel, which balances the flavor really well. Totoro is heaven! Fatty melting and aromatic totoro would simply satisfy all my sushi cravings.... red snapper tastes amzing too (fatty, soft, sweet and flavorful. Literally melts in your mouth. Best I have had of this kind). Hokoiddo uni is surprising juicy (usually drier in texture at most places).

Freshness is definitely something these guys pay attention to it seems. With about 8 to 12 different flavors there's not 100 hundred donuts laying around all day.

344,13,7,5.0,"Of all the Japanese chains opening in NYC lately, I was most excited to hear about Ikinari Steak's first U.S. location. I expected a line to be out the door on opening day, but was very surprised there wasn't one when I arrived around 11:50 a.m. (They opened at 11.) It was mostly press standing around blocking waitresses that were trying to bring food to customers or pressing against diners trying to eat. There were only few actual diners but more customers started to stroll in by the time I left. I was shown to a standing station right away and was done in 35 min. without scarfing down my food. The menu is small with 3 cuts of wet-aged steak by weight and 1 lunch special, a few sides, and a few drinks including beer and wine. Current prices are 9 cents/gram for ribeye, 8 cents/gram for sirloin, & 11 cents/gram for filet. There are minimum weight orders for the steaks so ribeye starts at 300g ($27), sirloin at 200g ($16), and filet at 200g ($22).How it works:- Instead of going to a counter to order first, an employee will show/direct you to a numbered standing station (Their model is based on standing dining stations but this location has a small number of seats. Ask about seats if you prefer one)- Menus are already at the standing station. A waiter will come over to bring water, a paper apron, & take your order for drinks and sides only.- Then the waiter will walk you or direct you to the back kitchen counter to order your meat (cut of meat and weight). You show/tell the kitchen chef your table number.Even if you order the chuck-eye steak lunch special which is not available by weight, you still have to go tell the kitchen counter your order. A little odd, but I guess this is to make the process consistent for the staff.- After you order your steak, you go back to your station and your food is brought out to you- Forks, knives, napkins & condiments are already at your station. There were no spoons. - A bill is brought to you when your steak is delivered. Keep it so you can pay at the front desk when you leave.I had the $20 chuck-eye steak lunch special because it's a good deal. It comes with soup, salad & white rice. Media reports say the chuck-eye is 14 oz. The lunch menu lists 300g (or 10.6 oz). The soup and salad are very small and basic, but you're really paying for the steak. My steak came out sliced on a sizzling platter with a side of corn. The chuck-eye already had nice color on the outside but was blue rare on the inside. There's even a printed guide on how to enjoy your steak, and they suggest rare.I usually prefer my steak medium or medium rare, but I went rare this time. My chuck-eye was very tender and flavorful from the fat and seasoning. The house hot steak sauce was delicious but didn't cover up the steak. Not sure if the house steak sauce is hot because it's warm and kept in a thermos, or also spicy. If there is spice, I didn't really taste it. But having warm sauce is perfect to help keep the steak warm. There's also Ikinari sauce that is a sweet sauce. It's also tasty but I preferred the house steak sauce. They also sell bottles of the Ikinari sauce.They are a non-tipping restaurant. I walked out full and happy from chuck-eye steak lunch for $21.78 after tax.About that paper apron...it's a good idea to help keep any grease splatter from the sizzling hot plate from getting on your clothes. The standing stations have lots of storage. A shelf where you can place menus after ordering or to store items, a hook to hang a coat or bags, and even foldable stands on the floor that can hold briefcases or bags. The kitchen is open so you do walk out smelling smokey like hibachi or K-BBQ places. The restroom has a fancy Japanese toilet with a dryer option. There's also Listerine if you want to be minty fresh. And if you're so inclined, they have a Niku mileage membership card that you can sign up for to track the weight of meat you eat. The card comes complete with Lady Liberty and has rewards after consuming a certain amount of beef. I'll be back to try other cuts. Definitely recommend trying this place for quality steak at reasonable prices.",23,0.9973

Typically when you first walk in you will see a crowd of people standing by the register giving you the impression that the line is long but usually those people are just debating on what sauce(s) to choose. I love condiments and sauces (probably because I'm so extra) and the sauces here are unique, eclectic, and seriously delicious. My favorite sauces are parmesan peppercorn, curry ketchup, and the sweet mango chutney mayo. The staff is always very kind and you can tell they work great together as a team. Upon ordering, the staff offers customers the option of sauce on the fries or the side. I've experienced both options and I prefer to have it on the side because I'm a dip kind of girl.",18,0.995

We started with a pitcher of white sangria ($40) which was tasty. I have had it before from this venue so I knew what we were ordering. Once we finished that we order a bucket of coronas (the bucket is a better deal than a pitcher because you get a beer free and they're in bottles). By the time we ordered the bucket of beer we were starting to get hungry so we order 2 French fries and a burger. They give you a buzzer so you know when your food is ready (nice and organized).

353,17,11,5.0,"It's more of a 4.5 for the strange hiccups in restaurant management, but the food is here is very solid, especially with so much ramen competition in the city. I accidentally stumbled upon EAK Ramen after a massage two blocks away and found this place on Yelp. Little did I know it had opened 4 days ago - a chain from Japan specializing in Iekei (E.A.K!) ramen - pork and shoyu broth combo with very thick noodles by, of course, Sun Noodles.We showed up and there seemed to be a lot of people waiting in line so we put our name down on the clipboard, Totto Ramen style. About 15-20 min later we were seated, which was pretty quick in my opinion given this place is brand new, ""hyped"", and it was Sunday dinner rush hour. We did see a few empty seats at the bar for some reason that they weren't filling for one reason or another. We sat at the bar, right in front of where a lady was washing cups and filling waters the entire time (not really that appetizing to watch). Service was decent - we were kind of served by the cup washer lady and our food was brought to us by other people. It seemed a little disorganized, to say the least and I heard another waitress expressing her frustration several times. I also noticed that the bartender doesn't seem to know how to pour beer - the beers she poured were like at least half foam! Our ramen also came out literally 30 seconds after they gave us our appetizer.... yikes. I hate when that happens because something always ends up getting cold. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that these new restaurant hiccups will likely get fixed as time passes.However, I came for the food... and not really expecting much of service. The karaage was hot, freshly fried, and very flavorful, unlike some places. They give you the option of choosing not one, but two sauces off their list - we got the garlic chili and sweet chili. I liked the sweet chili the best.The EAK Ramen (original pork/shoyu broth) with thick noodles and the garlic puree and onion really did it for me. It wasn't too salty and not too thick and the noodles were just the right consistency. The egg was absolutely the best egg I've had in the city - YUM. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. The pork left a bit to be desired as it wasn't really ""charred"" like Totto's is, but still melts in your mouth. An extra side is $3 and they give you a ton. All in all, this dish was quite satisfying and is one of the top 5 ramens I've had in the city for sure.Definitely worth a shot if you're a ramen snob like me. Hopefully they fix the service issues after they've been open longer. The pork/shoyu broth and thicker noodles hit the spot for us!",21,0.9907

Much better than a lot of the other Indian places nearby that I've tried. We had the cardamom rice pudding (free with first Yelp check-in) and he was very insistent that next time he let us taste his homemade ice cream. Dine-in veg curry lunch specials are $6.50 but rice or naan is extra at $3. Take-out veg lunch special is $8 - and you get a free side plus rice or bread. Portions are huuge and delicious. We had the okra and eggplant. Okra was slightly better spiced. But if you prefer creamy do the eggplant - plus they give you 3-4 whole roasted mini eggplants!The staff and especially the owner are extremely friendly and polite. Can't wait to come back!",24,0.988
356,38,25,5.0,"For those looking for the quintessential Parisian bistro experience, look no further than one of the latest newcomers to Manhattan's West Village: Boucherie. The restaurant opened at the end of 2016 to no small amount of acclaim, thanks to the fact that Chef Jerom Dihui (former chef of McNally's now shuttered Pastis) is behind the kitchens. The venue has a sprawling dining room and bar area that gets plenty of sunlight during the earlier hours, as well as a balcony on the second floor - for those looking to impress. Everything about the decor, from the sizeable mirror hung behind the bar, to the marble-patterned tables and tiled floors, is true to form.On a breezy Saturday evening, the restaurant was happily buzzing and unsurprisingly occupied - reservations in advance, especially on busy days, are recommended. We had our pick of seats (I recommend taking a table near the windowed doors or on the patio) and were soon greeted by our server and Paul, the sommelier. When I asked him for a wine recommendation (a white or sparkling, not too dry) he pointed out an effervescent and slightly sweet Brut Rose, which he asked me to taste first to make sure it was to my liking. Pinning down choices from the food menu, however, wasn't quite as easy... So we ending up ordering almost all the dishes that had caught our eyes.For our starters, we had gone with the Escargot and the Foie Gras Mousse. The former were served piping hot and generously drenched in an addictive garlic, butter, and parsley sauce; they were pleasantly toothsome and had none of the aftertaste I've sometimes encountered in dishes that weren't executed to par. Ask for an extra side of bread to soak up the remaining sauce - it's that good. My personal favorite, however, had to be the Foie Gras Mousse. It's beautifully presented with a side of red wine onion compote, frisee, and toasted bread; there are few things more perfectly balanced than a spread of the rich foie gras against the sweet-tartness of the onion compote supported by the firm, slightly crunchy bread. It may appear to be simple, but there's a reason why this dish has stood the test of time.When it came to the entrees, I immediately gravitated to towards the Duck Confit, which is served with a portion of confited duck leg, frisee salad, and a generous serving of black truffle chips. The duck had a delightful crisp skin that yielded to a flavorful dark meat, which paired well with the lighter salad that had the protein interspersed throughout it. I was able to try the Veal Porterhouse as well, which came impressively presented with the bone still in. It was cooked to the requested medium rare and each portion of meat was juicy and tender, pairing well with the red wine-infused veal jus that it was served with. We rounded out our meal with a side of Fries (crispy, hot, and perfectly seasoned) as well as a rustic Ratatouille, made with roasted tomatoes, zucchini, onions, and mushrooms.What makes Boucherie excel, however, is the caliber of service. Our plates were always promptly cleared and our server was always nearby to check on us; when I dropped my knife off the table, she was immediately at my side with a new one. And while I may not be a wine expert, those who do appreciate it will easily get lost in conversation with their Sommelier, Paul; he took a great deal of time to speak with us about his previous experiences (including Le Bernardin) and answered every question we had, from the wines available at Boucherie to the levels of certification as indicated by his Sommerlier pin.I very much look forward to returning now that the weather will allow for dining al fresco - and for those looking for a leisurely and welcoming meal in the city, Boucherie will certainly exceed your expectations.",54,0.9976

Small coffee table seating towards the front with a small seating area pass the counter towards the back. The Miles Coffee Bar provides inviting options to enjoy a cup of your favorite morning or evening beverage. In addition, the main attraction for me so far, has been the addictive vegan cookie, which had me break out in a Katy Perry song...'I ate a vegan cookie and I liked iittt...', definitely a must try for vegan-phobes. All items, sweet bakery goods or savory sandwiches are baked and made in-house by their onsite baker and available fresh daily; a definitive plus. And to add, just a little further towards the back area, you'll have an opportunity to make use of their patio and enjoy a selection of beer and wine during the warmer days. It is clear, this new establishment was well thought out in all aspects to help break the neighborhood monotony.

358,23,15,5.0,"Incredible experience for sushi lovers. A lot of good sushi has to do with equal parts craft and equal parts sourcing and you get it all here at Nakazawa. My husband made a reservation for us to eat the omakase at the sushi bar for my birthday - reservations open up 30 days in advance online. You need to reserve right at midnight because it fills up in minutes. There are 3 seating a night- we went to the 930 (think the others are 530 and 730) You also better show up (why wouldn't you - or not be late ) as they will charge you $150 if you don't. Service is really as you'd expect - serene and calm. It was fun watching the chefs work at the bar but it was probably the calmest sushi bar I'd ever seen. Wasn't too much of a show per se. You can I think more easily eat in their lounge but all sushi comes from the bar. Decor is zen and monochrome - simple and clean as the Japanese would have it. Drinks - they have an extensive list of sake, wine (more by the bottle versus glass), beers ( my husband ordered a Japanese red rice ale which was malty and flavorful- very interesting) and I glasses of Sauv Blanc and Gruner. As for dings on service, sometimes it was hard to hear or understand the chefs so I wish that our server did a better job of explaining each course. I guess she was more conversational when it was required - explaining different cuts of fish and demonstrating what was unique about each piece. For instance call me stupid but ginger was given to us on the side and i had to ask what to do with it - it was a palate cleanser in between each meal which honestly should be explained upfront since some people might think it goes with the fish (don't do that). You also shouldn't expect wasabi- that will accompany the piece if the chef feels it goes. They did explain though that you can eat either with your hands or chopsticks. If hands, they give you a little wet napkin to wipe in between.The omakase is 20 pieces and I'm not going to dive into each one because my guess is things change based on what can be flown in. They also ask you what you like and don't like i.e. My husband doesn't like roe. Of course customer service reigns supreme here as we noticed the couple next to us didn't like several of things (sadly) and were quickly given replacements. But, overall the real esoteric Japanese fish were white in nature and ranged from things like Spanish mackerel (can be oily and fishy), to other types of fish which I can't recall since all of the names are in Japanese. Of course there were crowd pleasers like delicious salmon types - one my favorites was one smoked with hay which has an earthy flavor. Others were more subtle. Others were salty based on the type of salmon like an Alaskan sockeye - you get to try all kinds of fish they create sushi from, it's not just from Japan. We also got to try very interesting shellfish sushi - like a citrus squid with yuzu and sea scallop - never really had these raw before. I also enjoyed the square type sushi which we had with crab. Mostly all other types were nigiri - no raw One of my favorites was the 3 piece Tuna trio from most lean to less lean to fatty tuna (everyone's favorite). You get actually pretty educated about different cuts of fish with this meal! For an upsell you can pay $13 for 3 pieces more which I recommend - two types of uni - one from California and one from Japan. Not sure if I actually like uni unless mixed in a pasta but it was incrediblyFresh. Perhaps the real killer piece of this upsell is the waygu beef. It was grade a something - but trust me it's worth the upsell for this!! Barely cooked and rare done, I don't usually eat beef this raw but it was so clean and fresh and flavorful and perfect pairing with the rice (which mind you was incredible- vinegary and flavorful). Absolutely yum with a hint of soy. They also had a tasty hand roll with tuna towards the end of the meal which was salty, and had good crunch from the Nori. For dessert, you end the meal with a delicious house made tea which was so warming. I forget the flavor but it was very good. And then an egg sushi- forget the name but the steamed egg is also pretty to look at and sweet and light in taste. And best yet, a scoop of lychee sorbet. Yum!A really awesome experience on all fronts so definitely go for a special occasion. Dinner for 2 was about $500 ish all in.",22,0.9993
359,16,14,5.0,"Super cute spot, albeit a little out of the way in alphabet city. From what I saw and tasted, this place is the real deal! Even all the employees there are Italian with heavy accents :)Pretty short and sweet menu, divided into appetizers, pastas (all made fresh in-house!), and meats. At the beginning of your meal, you get complimentary bread, and they also come by with a basket full of wines for you to choose from if you're in the mood for a glass! Note that they don't really have fancy cocktails unless you want the classics like a martini.This place does classic and simple really well. The 4 of us shared the following:Burrata E Pomodorini $15Clean and simple - just fresh burrata cheese and grape tomato, but it tasted extra freshhhh with the tomatoes chilled beforehand. Good start.Crostone ""Fagiolino"" $16Chicken liver, prosciutto cotto, mushroomsBEST dish of the night for sure. We at first got one order, which came with 3 crostinis. Since we had 4 people, we decided to ask them to add one more which we would pay for. Probably some language barriers/miscommunication but we ended up getting another order of it. Except this time, it came with 2 larger pieces of crostini haha. It was so good we didn't mind getting more of it :) Everything on there is so light, yet so flavorful. The prosciutto is delicate enough where you don't tug everything off the crostini in one bite, and the raw mushrooms shaved on top really lift the whole dish up. MUST GETTTT.Tagliatelle Bolognese $16Yummmm tagliatelle with beef ragout, this pasta was the perfect al dente! Spaghetticon Bottarga $22This was an interesting dish...when he described it, i honestly thought it was going to be like spaghetti with a shaving of bonito haha. I guess it IS pretty much like that, but with a finer dusting of bottarga mullet. The pasta is like a thinner and squiggly-er version of spaghetti, al dente to perfection, but i couldn't quite taste the bottarga. Would probably not get this again.Polpette al Sugo $20Yet another simple dish, meatballs in tomato sauce. Probably a little aggressive in charging $20 for this dish (6 meatballs), but they were good. I'd probably get more pastas instead of this dish if I ever went back.SpecialWe also got the special pasta of the day but I can't remember what it was called. I'll upload a picture so look there, but it looked like 5 perfectly plump and fat dumplings. The filling tasted like a spinach based filling, and it was fantastic. If i remember correctly, it came with a simple sage butter sauce.Everything was pretty delicious, and the restaurant is as cute as a button. Not as mom and pop-y as Bianca, but I think this is a pretty good alternative (I still miss Bianca though...!!!).",25,0.999

Look over the list of sushi available for today; check off your favorites and shudder at the fact that you may be paying $10 for ONE piece of sushi.

Repeat as often as possible. Some tips:1. It's called Sushi Yasuda, not Sashimi Yasuda. Carbs are good for your spirit and you don't want to miss the rice here. Go for the sushi.2. You do not necessarily have to get Omakase for the best experience here if you know what you like. Must-order pieces for me are the east coast uni, oyster, three different types of eels, and toro scallion hand roll.3. The Sushi Matsu is a great way to taste 12 different types of sushi and half a roll at a lower price point ($44.50)! You can order some more premium pieces to finish. 4.

362,18,9,5.0,"Walking down the block after leaving the restaurant, feeling euphoric, walking past Gramercy Tavern a few doors down, I just came to the realization that this is THE PLACE TO BE in 2017. There is nothing like this in NYC and makes other NYC institutions feel so 10 years ago... Having eaten at two of the restaurants owned by the same chef in Tel Aviv a number of years ago, totally blown away, I couldn't wait when I heard he was going to open his first restaurant in the US. It has a casual yet refined, and lively atmosphere. With much anticipation the two of us went a bit overboard and ordered: - Date donuts - excellent, absolute must have- Smoked eggplant caviar - extremely creative, utterly speechless, must have- Palestinian tartar - interesting tartar, very good- Foie gras - generous, tender and creamy grilled foie gras with crunchy condiments, perhaps the best and most creative foie gras I've ever had, absolute must have- Sea bass - tender, perfectly cooked, served with eggplant cream, must have- Octopus - extremely tender and beautifully presented, very good but a tad rich All dishes have a generous portion and are meant to be shared, and I totally agree. Even if your date or friend is not a big sharer, I would strongly encourage to share at least 3 main dishes, following the date donuts. They do not serve a free bread basket so we ordered kubaneh which was like a combination of brioche and croissant. I'm not usually a big fan of kubaneh but this was excellent. I also saw other tables eating Jerusalem sesame bagel which looked delicious. The cocktails were also outstanding. The manager told us that the cocktail menu was developed by a well known mixologist who worked at Eleven Madison and other institutions. Consistent with the food, the cocktails were extremely innovative yet refined. Of the 6 we tried, my favorites were Nur York Harvest (bourbon, must have), Clore Park Swizzle (arak, must have), and Old Fashioned (very good). The space is casual but sophisticated. I think it's good for dates, friends, or for business, or just drinks at the bar. I'm sure it's going to become extremely popular and hard to get a table, but for now it's a hidden gem which will surely impress whoever you want to impress...",26,0.9986

374,24,14,5.0,"An amazing time and experience at The Clocktower, which went much better than anticipated. I made a reservation a month before for my boyfriend's birthday, and I was so glad I made the choice of Clocktower. The food was absolutely delicious, atmosphere was perfect for a celebratory occasion, and service was attentive and unpretentious. Five stars/bonus point that my boyfriend had a really great time and very much enjoyed his birthday dinner, and who doesn't want to try to impress their loved one on their birthday.For those of you like myself who have limited exposure with a very basic understanding of British food, this is a place to try. Or rather, it is a must try. The menu looked outstanding upon reading, but note it all comes at a bit of a steep but all worth it price. I wanted to find a place that was somewhat fancy but without the necessites of a particular dress code. You can come and be yourself. It borders between casual but high end enough for any special occasion. There are three rooms plus the main bar. We sat in the middle room, or what I call the Hollywood room, with framed pictures upon pictures of well known celebrities. The lighting is nice and dim at night for what felt like a mostly intimate but comfortably spacious space for two people to converse. Meanwhile, food and drink -- I personally thought A-mazing. Cocktails are a worthwhile try ($16), all of which were expert mixtures and a lovely complement to our meals. Give Peas A Chance was our favorite of the night, a mixture of Bombay gin, Yellow chartreuse, Salted pea cordial, Lemon juice, Fresh mint, Butterfly absinthe, and Egg white. The Los Pollos Hermanos (ode to Breaking Bad perhaps) was refreshing as well. We ordered some appetizers -- 1/2 doz bucket of oysters bits and bobs and quail frumenty scotch egg with wild mushrooms, tea, liver parfait. For main, I had the Colorado lamb (spiced pistachio crust, mixed grains, caramelized yogurt, artichokes). My bf had the Berkshire pork chop (piccalilli, black pudding, crackling, apple sauce). We loved our dishes. I tried some of his pork chop, which was succulent and tender. My lamb chop was real tender and slid easily right off the bone. I would get this again, but I would also be curious to try one of their seafood dishes, like the sole or halibut. We ended our meals with a bit of dessert, but 'a bit' might be an understatement. The Pink Lady apple tarte tatin for two, Madagascar vanilla ice cream could have fed 4 people easily. But I would go for this in a heartbeat again. It was a truly sweet end to our meal. Overall, a really pleasant experience at The Clocktower and a successful birthday dinner for the two of us. I would recommend it for a special occasion, if you are looking for this sort of experience/food. It's not over the top but fancy enough to satisfy a more celebratory occasion. Otherwise, I would definitely return for brunch or lunch and see their offerings during the day. The dinner was exceptional, and I was very happy with The Clocktower in its entirety.

375,15,16,5.0,"Cafe Bari has saved my ass too many times. I work in SoHo, which is very very far from where I live. Though I tend to make coffee at home before work, I will occasionally need a second (or third or fourth) cup due to the nature of my job. Some use nicotine as a stimulant, some use caffeine. I happen to like my lungs clear and healthy, so I choose the latter. Cafe Bari, along with being comically convenient, has fabulous coffee served by fabulous folks in fabulously fast time. Can't ask for much more than that in a neighborhood coffeeshop. Convenient you ask? Cafe Bari is both subway-convenient and office-convenient, in my very specific case. You can pretty much step right off the subway platform at Canal Street and right into Cafe Bari. I also happen to work on East Broadway, which is a wasteland when it comes to to-go options. Bari is just steps from my office, so round-trip plus ordering/waiting is about five minutes. There's a Starbucks equidistant from my office but I virtually never go there now that I've discovered Bari.I'm from Philly (hold the boos, please), so I grew up being taken to La Colombe in Manayunk. My parents are big coffee-drinkers as well, so I started young. My coffee knowledge is slightly above remedial, but I can at least tell the difference between Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, Coffee Bean (or what used to be Coffee Bean) and a more artisan place like Bari. Namely, that Bari is head and shoulders (like, Shaq's head and shoulders) any of that chain crap. When I heard that Bari served La Colombe coffee, I ran over there within the hour. Even better than I remembered, probably because I'm a working adult now and not a teenager wanting to get into coffee because my parents made it seem cool (I told you, this could've just as easily been cigarettes and thank god it's not). Bari has your standard offerings as far as cafes go. Like a lot of these hipster places, they only have two sizes. The large is about the size of a Starbucks grande, if you need a reference point. My go-to drink there is a large almond milk cappucino, which is $5. If you're worried about quantity, I suppose you should go corporate, but I promise you that quality over quantity is a particularly salient argument in this case. They've got that awesome almond milk there that's specifically made for coffee, which makes a huge difference. Add in one of those lovely steamed milk hearts atop each drink and now you've got coffee *and* a smile. Ah, yes, a smile. A *genuine* smile. Not a routine, get-out-of-my-face-so-I-can-get-to-the-next-customer-and-I'm-really-exasperated kind of smile. The staff/baristas at Cafe Bari are fabulous. Everyone's nice, everyone's friendly, and they've got awesome taste in music. Today I walked in and they were blasting Britney, then NSYNC, then Spice Girls. A magical TBT. Service is fast, product is top-notch. Though I can't speak to the abundance of pastries here, I can report that my coworker comes in with a chocolate croissant from Cafe Bari every morning and devours it. So I can directly say they're delicious, I suppose. Pretty sure everything that comes out of this small-but-mighty shop is a slam dunk.",19,0.9981
376,25,13,5.0,A more suited named for this delightfully delicious confectionary shop should be hidden cakes as it is located on 18th street down the staircase in the basement of a brownstone building. These are the types of shops you love for their uniqueness. As you walk in assuming down the stair case not sure what to expect you find your self in a cramped hallway infront of the entrance door. As you open the door you are greeted by the joyous bakers in the shop who are working on their next masterpiece. When you get to the counter you see all the cookies and cupcakes that all look scrumdidlyumptous! I selected the nuetella macadamian nut half pound cookie and the snicker doodle half pound cookie. They were both just as good as they looked. The texture to flavor it was just cooked to perfection. Though I must say the Nutella cookie was better.In short:- scrumdidlyumptous half pound cookies- friendly bakers- hard to find - basement shop,32,0.9853

Hardworking Robyn was wonderful.Now, the food: DELICIOUS!!! My friend had a blue cheese burger--he loved it. I had the special DOLLY BURGER, & it was really yummy, delicious!! It's a tie-in with the Broadway play HELLO DOLLY, starting Bette Midler. So every 100th Dolly Burger served here, has Bette serving this & she came out of the kitchen....the place went wild!!!! Nah, I'm just kidding you, but the burger was really, really, delicious!! This is in high contrast to my one other 5 Napkin Burger several years ago ON NINTH AVE IN THE West 50's. Service was non-existent literally. I was at a table, starving, & I kid you not, I counted 5 servers, standing & glancing at my table from several feet away. No one came to take my order. After about 15 minutes, I spoke with the hostess. Apparently my server was in the bathroom. Alright, it happens, but, please take my order. At end of meal, I was offered comp dessert, & a coffee, but I said politely, no thank you. I needed Pepcid AC after the burger, maybe it was the carmelized onions...probably, although tasty. After that experience I couldn't go back until last night--different location & AWESOME SERVICE BY ROBYN! We wonder if he is an owner. Yep, that's how awesome! 2nd Ave & East 70th Street--YES!!!! Delicious burgers. Neither of us had fries, but they looked great!!",25,0.9953

379,13,8,5.0,"I received a xmas gift for a thermal bath, aromatherapy & 60 min massage. I didn't want to go by myself so I also purchased the same package for my mom & sister for xmas. $213 each. Oh my.... one of the best massages I've ever had with the exception of the Balinese massage I got in Bali. When we arrived, we were given complimentary teas while we waited in the lobby. We were given a private changing room for the 3 of us. Then we were escorted to the massage room that overlooked the thermal baths. We had the private room to ourselves. All three of us got our massages side by side with a curtain separation. It felt very luxurious! We all agreed that the massages were superb & super relaxing. The massage therapists were excellent! The best massage in the city for sure! 5 stars!!!After the 60 min massage we then enjoyed all the thermal baths, aromatherapy steam room & the complimentary teas. Died and went to heaven! Amazing! The thermal baths were inside this underground super luxurious space. I felt like I was in a greek or roman baths from back in the days. Loved the salt water pool & jet bath. All the stress & aches in my body melted away. The entire experience was 135 min. 60 min massage + 75 min thermal baths. After the we finished the thermal baths, we then went to a spa shower where we were treated with Loccitane shampoo/conditioner & body wash. They had a large vanity with hair dryers & lotions.

380,14,11,5.0,"Polpette, we finally met. I have walked by many days, thought the menu looked amazing, and kept forgetting about it when it came to dinner. My mistake was I didn't bookmark it on Yelp. As a seasoned Yelper, I made a rookie mistake.I called to make a reservation since most of the reviews state that there tends to be a wait. They only take reservations for 4 or more that are made 24 hours in advance. They have a small bar if you do have to wait. The bartender seemed very friendly with everyone seated at the bar. The lemon martini is excellent. It's $12, which is fair for a good martini. We snagged the last table for 2, so no wait for us around 7 on a Saturday. In general I like this spot a lot because his prices are reasonable for quality food and drinks. I hope he keeps it this way because his model is definitely working. To begin they serve a delicious basket of bread with oil. The bread had a seasoning in it that I like, I think it was rosemary. We ordered the meatball sliders and a caesar salad. We noticed most people did try the meatballs since they state on their menu that it's their item they are well known for. The meatballs were tender and bursting with flavor. There was just enough sauce on the meatball so all the flavors could be enjoyed. It comes with a tasty salad. Once again, impressive that for $12 the sliders were served with a salad. The salad had a light flavorful dressing, which made me think next time I'd try another salad other than caesar. The dressing tasted homemade. My hunny really enjoyed the caesar salad too. I ordered the lobster ravioli with shrimp in a vodka sauce for $20. It typically comes with a white cream sauce, but I'm all about vodka sauce so the waiter was more than happy to swap it. The portion was excellent-I managed to eat it all! It was so delicious, I couldn't stop eating. The vodka sauce was creamy. I think it had cabbage sprinkled on top which added a nice crunch and presented well. The two shrimp on it were large and fresh. The ravioli were overflowing with lobster and cheese. I was impressed by their large selection of homemade pasta dishes. I'm a huge fan of homemade pasta. I'll be back for the squid ink linguini. The staff were all very friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. I feel that it's rare to find such good service with reasonable prices in Manhattan. I'm scared to hit save on this review because I really want our table for 2 to waiting for us! My hunny and I agreed we found our new neighborhood spot, finally!",18,0.9967

Our group had a lot of questions and they were really nice about everything. We were a little over the 30 minutes and not once did they rush us. I think there's about 12 pieces- some of my favorites include the waygu beef, uni, salmon, yellowtail. I paid the extra 8 for a piece of toro- WORTH IT!!!! SO FRESH! I also paid 12 for a wagyu x uni hand roll- OMG BEST THIS EVER!!! MUST TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT IS SO GOOD!WAGYU x UNI- FAVORITE!!!!!!!

The dumplings, wheat noodles, rice balls, and fish balls are excellent and so so cheap. 5 entrees came out to be ~$15. We left a generous tip because of the price and how friendly the staff was. Turns out you can definitely eat well in New York with 5 bucks or less. The only thing I didn't really care for was the beef tripe soup.

Personally I am a huge fan of round tables with a large party since it makes it easier to share dishes, which is exactly what we did.We tried a mix of appetizers and entrees, with plenty of drinks to go around. Everything from the Parmesan butter bread, to the brisket tots, to the selected cheese plate was spot on and ideal for sharing. I particularly LOVED and will come back for the warm lentil appetizer with the gooey poached egg. So not something I would normally order, but so worth every bite. Will I be back? For sure. But I think The Gander is ideally the type of spot for a large group so you can sample a variety of options given they are all so unique. It'd be cool to see an mixed appetizer sampling given the many varied (and delicious!) dishes.",12,0.9792
385,11,9,5.0,"Kingsbridge Social Club (or as I have decided to call it, KBS) opened recently in the Bronx. It's a great addition to the neighborhood! While the Bronx obviously has no shortage of pizzerias, KBS is so much more than that. Wood-fired specialty pizzas with toppings ranging from quail eggs to meatballs, plus sandwiches, salads, and unique appetizers. We ordered the House Pie (10) & one of their daily specials, a pie with herbed chicken, flor di latte, and sweet peppers. We also got the meatballs (9) as an appetizer. Meatballs were really delicious. The sauce they were in was also amazing, even though I believe it was a simple homemade marinara. The bread that came with it was also warm & delicious. The pies were both great as well.Now, usually, I don't condone the use of all caps (ahem, Mr. Trump, if you're reading, take note). However, what I'm about to say requires it. THEY HAVE PROSECCO ON TAP. And red wine. I'm not even sure what makes this so exciting except that I didn't know it was possible. We actually stuck with beers last night, but next time, rest assured I will be tapping that (pun intended). Beer offerings are good, I wish they would clarify a little better which are draft, can & bottle. It was a little confusing. Also, in case someone from the restaurant is reading, I'll fully forgive it for now since they're so new, but the waiter definitely needs some additional training on beer styles & appearances.The physical space is small but cute, the decor is interesting. Dave (the owner? manager?) was available and friendly, pitching in where needed & making sure everyone was happy.

386,36,20,5.0,"Italian Tacos // Fancy Sandwich PocketsMouthwatering Roman Street Food // Quick Bites Imagine all of those savory Italian dishes, that are not so portable being more portable! That's exactly what Italian Chef Stefano Callegari did, and it's good!Came to meet a friend, and was not hungry or in the mood for a sandwich. Tried a couple bites of their braised pork with rosemary and fennel pollen, and the rice-ball of the day. Both were delicious! No doubt I will be back.The pork was hearty, the flavor was rich. The bread was tender with just the right amount of crisp, it was hollowed out not too thick. So if you are shy about the carbs it's good, this feels like a warm crust with the center dug out. The savory flavors inside will remind you of a home cooked meal. I can see why this was such a hit in Rome.The price seems reasonable for a snack, considering the ingredients. However, if you are hungry you may end up buying a couple of sandwiches. Think... pizza slice, or an Italian tacos.The sitting area is relatively small.

There are so many flavors to choose from and you get to pick as many flavors as you want, just have to pick the size - small, medium, or large. Each flavor becomes a petal and forms gorgeously into a flower shape - looks like a rose. You can also top it with a macaroon like we did :pI believe Amorino's originally from France.

388,23,11,5.0,"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!! Best bang for your buck near times square, in my opinion. How it works is, you pick one base (pita, hummus bowl, salad, rice) and then a protein. The rest is an unlimited one-time toppings bar. Sort of like a chipotle for mediterranean food but you put the toppings on yourself!Food: yummy and fresh! I loved that they had sooooo many options and all vegetarian. They have beets, chickpeas, radish, cabbage, and plenty of sauces to choose from. This place a veggie haven! Also, serving size is big enough to eat for two meals. Cost: Decent. There are a few toppings that you can choose to add on to your base that are extra, but I'd say skip that and just bulk up on the free toppings ;D It costs about $8-12 depending on what base and protein you decide to get. Service: Very friendly staff! It was my first time trying it and I was confused as to how things work and the staff was very accommodating and friendly to explain. They also made me fresh chicken shawarma since the other was sitting out for a while. Will be back?

Not sure about you, but I find most of the spots I have saved up to visit are all 'new' American / Italian cuisine whereas Mediterranean/Israeli spots are usually on the casual side, so found this mid-price and classy spot as a great change of pace. Timna is located just slightly below ground and has a quaint but polished atmosphere and an amazing staff who is eager to suggest their favorite dishes. The bartender I interacted with was straight from Israel, and the only one in his family in America and suggested a few amazing Israeli wines for me to try and they were excellent, who knew Israel has the good juice?I ordered the cauliflower dish as a starter along with the ""must order"" bread that comes in a clay pot. While I enjoyed the bread, the flavors in the cauliflower dish and accompanying sauce were outstanding, vegetarian or not. For my main I went with the roasted carrots on farro, again accompanied with two masterfully paired sauces.While most people (me included) would expect some upscale hummus, falafel, hell maybe even a kick-ass tabbouleh from this place, Timna goes above and beyond these basic dishes to create new, creative and flavorful dishes.",35,0.9955
391,19,15,5.0,"I've lived in this city for close to 3 years but with the exception of my local bodega, I have yet to become a regular at any one particular spot. I've gone to great bars, restaurants, and cafes but because I love trying somewhere new, I'll almost always opt for an unfamiliar place over a familiar one. Chochin is one of the few places that I will work very hard to be a regular at. At first, I was quite surprised to find a homey hole in the wall serving up Japanese home-style cooking in the middle of Yorkville, given that most of the Japanese places around here are generic sushi takeout spots. Well, East Village's loss is my gain because as soon as we stepped outside after our meal, we made plans to come back the following weekend to try more dishes. When we first came in at around 6, right when it opened, I had a brief moment of panic that this place wouldn't survive the lack of foot traffic around this Second Avenue-adjacent neck of the woods. Then the place filled up to capacity within minutes. So definitely come here right when it opens, especially if your group is more than 2 people. The menu is in English but everything else may as well have been imported from Japan. There's one guy in the very back making all the food. The waitress manning the former sushi counter was very sweet and explained each dish as she brought it out but she didn't know things like BYOB or leaving a party's name down while they wait. Which is completely fine because the home-cooked food more than makes up for it. Lately, I've been fiending hard for Japanese-style comfort dishes and Chochin (""lantern"") handily delivers. This is what we ordered (ranked in order of how much I loved it):(1) Spicy tuna don. My stars. This was as far away from the gunky, spicy mayo-slathered mess that other places tend to serve. If there was any mayo (which I absolutely loathe) in this dish, I could barely taste it. The rice was cooked to perfection: buttery soft with a hint of vinegar. (2) Whole tomato soup. Perfect for a freezing winter night. It comes as a tomato sitting in a lake of cheese. Inside the tomato is the softest-boiled egg you ever did see. It sounds like a children's tale but it's really the best thing I've eaten all week. (3) The miso soup that came as a side to my spicy tuna rice bowl. This one tasted like it was brewed from scratch and didn't have that immediate umami bomb that other places' soup delivers but still tasted wonderfully hearty. (4) The hamburger appetizer. It tasted more like meatloaf than your usual burger patty. (5) Daikon salad. Eat some veggies, yo. (6) Fried oysters. I don't really like oysters in general and I'm trying to wean myself off fried stuff in time for the summer months so this was doomed from the get-go in my book but my boyfriend liked it. CASH ONLY. Place is tight, so tight that if you come here with even the barest hint of a cold, you'll drive away your neighbors in disgust (i.e., don't come here when you're sick and nursing a tub of Robitussin!). I'll be back in a few days!",33,0.9822

It's moist (giggity), thick (giggity giggity), ridiculously flavorful and I want at least a half dozen of them delivered to me right now. The chicken sausage I added on was also such a great idea because it was also so flavorful and it just made my biscuit *that* much better and meatier. This little gem just opened up a few weeks ago, so there is currently only bar seating, but don't let that deter you. In fact, I would actually highly recommend high-tailing your asses there ASAP so you can get one or two or ten of those biscuits before this place really blows up and the lines become insane.

They are reasonably priced, the decor is beautiful, and the food is amazing. I have been eyeing this bookmark I have saved forever mostly due to that beautiful ""New & Hot"" tag. First time I dined with them was for pick up for lunch since I work close by. Their lunch prices range in the 10-15 dollar range which I think is reasonable due to the excellent portion sizes it comes with two sides as well. The second time I decided to dine with them it was for lunch but I did nab a seat at the bar for lunch with a friend. She is a Yelp Eliter and was blown away by the decor once arriving and then the food wowed her as well. Once getting back to the office we were immediately planning our next lunch at this spot. The bartender definitely added to the experience by being personable.In terms of the food, my favorite is the Pad Kra Prow with chicken. They will ask if you want it spicy and I don't recommend getting ""spicy"" if you cannot deal with heat, and I would recommend stating you would like it ""mild"". This is a great place for a date, large parties, or if you happen to be in the Flatiron/Chelsea area and want great quality Thai.I normally post pictures of food when I go out to dine but EACH TIME I GO I JUST DIVE INTO MY FOOD.

The price for the medium and the large size is the same.Tuna Tataki Salad - I really like this salad. It is seared ahi tuna with some snow peas, shredded carrots, a few blueberries, banana peppers, and a piece or two of broccoli in the mixed greens with wasabi vinaigrette dressing on the side.Spicy Tuna Bread - A savoy pastry. It is crispy on the outside and warm on the inside. The tuna used for this pastry is cooked.Matcha Croissant - I liked it. It has creamy matcha filling in the center.Spicy Salmon Avocado Sandwich with Cucumber - This is really good.Smoked Salmon Sandwich with Lettuce, Cream Cheese, Cucumber & Red Onion - This is also really good. Kind of reminded me of smoked salmon bagel. Tuna Avocado Sandwich with Lettuce - This is tasty.Egg Salad Sandwich with Tomatoes - Creamy and delicious Mochi an Pan - Personally I don't like this one because I found it heavy.

398,19,17,5.0,"Tenth Avenue in Hell's Kitchen has long been a ""no man's land"" when it comes to the restaurant scene. The only mainstays over the last several years have been Pio Pio, 44 & X, and 44 1/2. A few years ago, along came farm-to-table The Marshal, bringing with it a new ambiance and cuisine to the area. It is the success of The Marshal that allowed the introduction of Dianne & Elisabeth by the same owner just down the block, a quaint wine bar that also includes fresh produce and eclectic mains and various varietals of wine you can't get just anywhere. Having visited Dianne & Elisabeth a few times now, I can say the service, the food and drink and the ambiance is consistently exceptional. My favorite wine on the menu, which I recommend very highly, is the Counoise, a red varietal that is medium-bodied and not too sweet, yet not bitter. And it is a perfect, reasonably-priced wine. In fact, ...it's the only wine I choose to order here. On to the menu: Spicy Marinated Pineapple ($5) - Huge pieces of pineapple seasoned nicely Langostino Poppers ($12-small, $18-large) - beer battered langostinos, lemon garlic thyme aioli. So far, this is the best plate I've tried on the menu - each ""popper"" is verrry meaty, and only lightly battered. Beet, Apple, & Fennel salad ($12-small, $18-large), with blue cheese, caraway, and a red wine honey vinaigrette. This was the perfect balance of the sweetness of the apple with the bitterness of the beets, presented beautifully. Croquettes ($12-small, $18-large) - pork lardon swiss cheese, smoked paprika cream. I'm generally not a fan of dishes on the creamier and cheesier side (only a personal preference), but these are definitely worthwhile if you are. So far, I've only been for wine and apps, but the rest of the menu looks awesome. Hopefully I'll get the opportunity to go back again soon and try more. When it comes to ambiance and service, I must say George the bartender, and Emilio the service have been nothing but kind and professional.

Located in the retro and classic Beckman hotel, it has fantastic interior--chandeliers, colorful glass windows, high ceiling and huge wall windows facing the street. Staff is friendly and helpful at recommending drinks to pair with our dishes.We ordered hamachi with sea urchin, roasted Jerusalem artichokes, black bass, and baked Alaska. Everything was excellent. The sauce in hamachi and sea urchin is slightly sour and nutty which matches the fat hamachi and nutty sea urchin perfectly well. Black bass: one of my freshest and most delicious seafood dish of the year. Highly recommend. Jerusalem artichokes: (the root of artichokes, very starchy like potatoes) the artichokes are nicely baked and flavored--slightly fruity sweet taste, yet has more details as you chew along. A hint of fiber-ish texture and veggie/fruity ish flavor. Excellent sauce.Baked Alaska: surprise ice cream hidden inside! Yummy as how pretty it is!Highly recommend.

It was a bachelor nightmare.Maybe that's why my mind went a little blank at my plate of wonderful spaghetti at spaghetti incident. The room was handsome. Dimly lit, with a brick wall, mirrors with cute planters underneath. It felt like a little Italian home, miles away from the lower East side poser scene.An adroit young man, with a new bass voice, who couldn't have been 20 had the grace and poise of the best waiter I ever had.  He checked on me just enough, was warm with enough distance, and quickly recommended his favorite dishes with descriptions, and without hesitation. The kitchen is open, and I could smell my spaghetti with salsciccia cooking with garlic, pork and white wine. The pasta is house made and al dente, a treasure, confirmed by the happy Italians dining next to me.Glasses for montepulciano were a breezy and generous $7.  I opted for a second glass over the panna cotta, a not so easy decision, but the place is cash only, so I wanted to have enough to leave a generous tip.This cozy bistro is a little gem if you love spaghetti, and if you don't, you should come for the small plates and desserts and drink wine, which I'll do in the very near future.

401,16,11,5.0,"As a skeptic of any cha siu place that isn't a hole in the wall, I was blown away by the deliciousness & quality of the food here, in addition to the atmosphere, cleanliness and friendliness of the waiters. Crispy roast duck in the mantou sandwich was super flavorful, and I highly recommend it. I was expecting a small mantou with a little bit of duck for a pricey $8 but boy I was wrong! Huge mantou with a bit of that duck fat grease, and enough pieces of duck that you'd see on an entree. Prepare for this to be messy to eat, naturally. Just pick up the duck pieces that fall out with your fork and add some of their heavenly chili sauce to it. The five spice short rib plate with egg noodles was surprisingly tasty as well. Short rib is fall off the bone, except they make it even easier and take out the bones already, topped with a bunch of garlicky, saucy garnishes including braised daikon. It was super delicious. My only feedback is that the egg noodles were a tad soggy and a tiny bit bland (though that might have been bc I didn't mix some parts of it well, as everything else was bursting with flavor), but this was entirely made up for when sprinkling some of their garlic chili flakes and oil. Admittedly an entire mantou sandwich and egg noodles plate was too much for one person, but I'm glad I tried both and was pleasantly surprised at the big portion sizes! I'll be back again for that crispy roast duck.",30,0.9907
402,18,14,5.0,"TL:DR for those who are confused about MSB's family-style option and whether you should come with a large group (or whether it's worth it to come with a small dining party) - YES, the food is delicious. But your dining experience will be quite different. I came here for dinner with a friend, and we ordered the fried duck dumplings, steamed pork buns (not on the menu), fried brussels sprouts, and seared pork ribs.The steamed pork buns were excellent. The buns were pillowy soft but just firm enough to hold up to tender braised pork. And boy, was the kitchen generous with the pork! The accompanying pickled cucumbers provided a nice acidity and textural contrast. This was served with ssam sauce, which tasted like a lighter gochujang sauce (Korean chili paste). Honestly, the pork buns are pretty much perfect as is - I think adding the ssam sauce is a disservice. The fried brussels sprouts were yummmmmy. The fish sauce was not overpowering as it was balanced by an herb mixture that made it more of an assertive vinaigrette to coat the perfectly fried brussels sprouts. The duck in the duck dumplings was just ok. I couldn't really discern the taste of the duck itself, but I thought the crispy wanton (with a sea salt crust?) and the mint sauce were excellent. The seared pork ribs were succulent. They were marinated in gochu sauce and then seared. Somehow, I thought the glaze on top was more teriyaki then gochu, but I loved the smokey, umami flavor as well as the toasted sesame seeds and the spice from the scallions. It was quite tender and fell off the bone that we could eat the ribs with silverware.HOWEVER, I think this dish is improperly labeled under ""ssam"". Ssam means lettuce wrap in Korean. So I thought the ribs would be accompanied by lettuce or some kind of veggies, but the dish was just five giant pieces of ribs. Our waitress was gracious enough to bring over some lettuce when I asked, but I don't think it makes sense for the main entree to be just hunks of meat without any veggies. Regardless, I saw that the grilled porgy comes with tortillas for you to make fish tacos with at the table so I think the label is appropriate depending on what you order. But don't expect all of the ""ssam"" courses to come out in the lettuce wrap style like you would for the family-style option. We finished the meal with the creme brulee, which is highly recommended. The custard is matcha, infused with thai basil. The perfume of that and the brulee on top are HEAVENLY. My God, I can have this all to myself and I would still want more. I can't wait to come back to try their seafood donabe, as the table next to me ordered it and it looked delectable with so much seafood. I'd order all of the above dishes again in a heartbeat except for the duck dumplings!",23,0.998

Coming on the heels of the spectacular orchid exhibit here is another stunner, the Dale Chihuly Exhibit. This artist has managed, with hand blown, colored glass, to mold creations that evoke images of flamingoes, stars, sea anemones and other fantastical forms. Some are huge impressive structures as tall as trees, with squiggly, swirly extensions that fascinate and capture the eye. Others resemble ordinary objects, like balls, only dazzling in their color combinations. All are intriguing. This is a stellar exhibit that I recommend seeing in various lights, on a cloudy day, during a sunny day, and during extended evening hours when they are lit up. Even if you see it only once, the exhibit will impress. And of course the gardens themselves are always magnificent any time.Note: The Dale Chihuly Exhibit is on until October. If you go now, you get the lovely cherry and lilac trees in bloom to enjoy while you stroll through the rest of the park.Extra treat at the gardens: Birders should know that there is a pair of nesting Great Horned Owls at the gardens now.

I took a mental note that I had to put this on my list of things to do. After a very early morning great experience at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, I made my way over to the Bernarducci Meisel Gallery. I entered the gallery and stood and pondered in front of many of the arts on display, mesmerized and amazed by the artistry. Upon first glance, your eyes immediately see a photograph and then as you step closer the realization dawns on you that they are actually either a painting or drawing...unbelievable. For a long moment, I stood and imagined myself seated with a glass of champagne, continuing to listen to the mellow smooth jazz playing in the background and staring at these pieces. That's how much I wanted to stay and immerse myself further. A thank you goes to Kimberly who kindly answered all of my many questions and also allowing me to catch a glimpse of their resident puppy while venturing farther throughout the gallery.

I loved their open seating and bistro vibe of the joint and made a mental note to swing by on a warm night. We were greeted warmly by our servers, Jose and Niko - and ordered a bunch of things to try out. We had:Steak Tartare (small portion): omg, so good! And such a healthy size too. We finished it but totally doable to share among a group of 3-4! They use the ends of their tenderloin steaks so this is top notch quality meat!French Onion Soup: a last minute add on but man - such a good call. Delicious, just the right amount of salt, and the perf melty cheese. Duck Confit: the quintessential French dish so I just had to try it. The smell of the truffle potatoes were intoxicating. The greens were a little overly salted in some areas but I just made sure to mix well before eating. Hefty portion of duck as well! Ordered medium but I may go even below that next time as it was slightly tough. Lamb Shank: huuuuumongous portion. Couscous was perfectly cooked and for someone who isn't a fan of gamey meats, I thought it was quite good!We also had to order a side of fries after seeing the table next to us indulge in some. Best. Decision. Ever. I'd go back just for the fries (and some of that Tartare). We also ordered two Old Fashions which were okay - was expecting something more from their drinks. Perhaps I'd try some of the wines next time. And there will definitely be a next time. Between the great food, superb ambiance, amazing service (and open kitchen to boot!), I am a super fan.

Came here with my family on an early Sunday evening to celebrate my Mom's birthday, and as one might expect at Keith McNally restaurant during opening week, the restaurant was packed. Moody lighting, antiquey accents, and that overall glamorous brasserie feel make this one beautiful restaurant. I think it's also great to have such a great name down in the financial district/Seaport area which is constantly and thankfully getting upgraded in terms of food options. The service was warm, professional and honestly... there. The restaurant was well staffed, considering it's not even a huge space (much smaller than Balthazar).  We had: - Delicious amuse bouche of puffs with caviar- a delicious bread basket (not joking) - with seasoned olive oil, and butter - mixture of white and wheat bread- the Waldorf salad, classic- The foie gras - The avocado/crab saladAll the salads were super fresh. As far the mains, we all tried different things. From the burger, to the leg of lamb, to the halibut, special pork chop, and uni pasta. I had one bite of this and it was satisfying - breadcrumb, uni, crab... very good flavor and texture. The dishes was very classic, simple and just tasty.I myself was torn between the duck l'orange, which I wish I had gotten now and the steak frite. I got the latter. The steak frite is so so delicious - au poivre style with serious peppercorns and a sweet ish sauce. The frites, as they are at all of their restaurants, are delicous. I didn't try my hubby's lamb since he was across the table but he said it was really well done and enjoyed the beans. In the end, we got two desserts - the seasonal apple tartin (delicious) and a Napolean type of dessert. Both were so fresh, and tasty. I really thought the food here again was spot-on, re: flavor and fresh ingredients.

410,17,10,5.0,"Worth the wait and definitely not just a gimmick of standing while you eat. One of the best (and cheapest) steaks I've had. I was surprised to see such a long line but it moved very quickly - there was about 20-30 people in front of me, but I was able to get ""seated"" in an hour. The smell when you walk in is heavenly. The system works like a well-oiled machine - you would think that a bunch of diners standing around would make things chaotic, but the staff (who are some of the friendliest I've encountered in NYC) swiftly took our drink and side orders before directing us to the ""Cut to Order"" station to pick out our steaks. TIP - if dining for just two, I highly recommend asking for the total grams of steak (i.e. 600g) and then having it cut in half - that way, you get a thicker cut of steak which will be much juicier and tastier vs. asking for two separate 300g cuts. There are plenty of helpful signs and staff around to help out if you're unsure of which type (ribeye, filet or sirloin) or weight to get (there are also ounce conversions). The 300g was plenty for me, and I went with the ribeye. And yes, you should get rare or - at worst - medium rare. Anything further is just downright disrespectful.The food came out pretty quickly, about 10 minutes, on sizzling plates. It was DIVINE. The steaks come with corn topping but you can replace with a variety of other veggies or add extras for $1 each. I highly recommend the Ikinari sauce on your steak - it doesn't take away from the flavor but rather enhances it. The quality and taste of the meat was so good, and an amazing value considering the price. DO NOT PASS ON THE GARLIC RICE!!! One of the most delicious side dishes ever - mixed with more corn, crispy garlic, bits of steak, and pepper. A divine combination. The standing while eating concept was a great experience. I didn't mind it at all - it was fun, casual, and made people eat a ""power dinner"" which must have contributed to the line moving quickly. A huge kudos again to the amazing staff who were so attentive - even though Ikinari is marked as a non-tipping establishment. I will DEFINITELY be back!!",38,0.9982

We ordered the pakora fried oysters which spiciness Anita Lo informed me could be considered slow. Anita Lo prepared a masterful blend of textures on the plate. The focus of the dish was the oyster itself: crispy on the outside and so unbelievably soft on the inside. It sat upon a cucumber pedestal.

Right across the middle of the plate was a brush of yogurt which looked like the carefully crafted stroke of an oil painting.For the entree, Anita Lo ordered the Sea Bass by Anita Lo while I ordered the Duck by Anita Lo.

My thin, Asian, hair can be a struggle sometimes, but he cut it to perfection. He even told me my last barber gave me an incredibly uneven haircut... good thing that person is nowhere near New York City. He was friendly, offered plenty of suggestions, and listened to my concerns with having flat, boring hair and offered ways to fix it. I wanted my hair quite shorter than it currently was at the time, but not too short. Some places have always cut my hair too short, but he understood what I wanted and gave me exactly the length I was thinking of. He spent over an hour on my cut and almost 30 minutes on the styling itself. That's a lot of love to give to a single customer! Very much satisfied with my haircut as it is a very flattering length with layers that complement my face.He gave me blow out and the day after, I washed my hair and inspected it while straight, which is usually how I wear my hair since I'm so lazy to do anything to it and I must say, I love it! Looks and feels great. As reference, I cut at least 3 inches off my lengthI also looked around and saw a lot of people with nicely balayaged/ombre'd hair.

423,102,73,5.0,"This was my first Broadway musical ever. Setting the bar quite high, am I right?I acquired tickets through an AmEx pre-sale back in June 2016, and saw the show beginning of February 2017. Face-value seats in the back of the Orchestra center section ended up being about $210 apiece. Currently, the lowest price you can find on third-party sites is about $500 per ticket, and that's for the back of the mezzanine seating. Curse you, third-party sites and high demand. The Hamilton show lottery currently releases 46 seats for $10 each (max 2 tickets per person), but as tens of thousands people enter this lottery, the tickets are hard to come by. Hopefully soon, demand goes down, and therefore, prices will go down too? Who knows, though? Nonetheless, just keep scouring the internet and do what you can to get a ticket at a (relatively) reasonable price. It might be physically and emotionally draining, but just save your strength and stay alive.Richard Rodgers Theater: Perhaps not the best possible venue, but the good thing is that there really don't seem to be any terrible seats, and the capacity ain't half bad. As previously mentioned, we were seated in the very back of the orchestra center section, and we had a pretty great view of the stage. On the other hand, the seats themselves were a little cramped, and the crowds can get a little out of hand pre-show and during the 15-minute intermission. Nonetheless, given how good Hamilton is, you will more than willingly brave these conditions for this particular show.Hamilton The Musical: Lives up to the massive hype, and is certainly not at all overrated, as one orange-toned man may have previously declared. I hadn't listened to any of the songs, or read any Wikipedia articles, so as to go into the show with a relatively unadulterated view. Anyways, I was worried that some of the rap dialogue might be hard to follow, but it turned out to be fine since all the actors and actresses enunciate exceptionally well, and the singing and stage directing was (obviously) top notch. Javier Muñoz, Brandon Victor Dixon, Lexi Lawson, and Mandy Gonzalez were all great in their respective roles of Hamilton, Burr, and the Schuyler sisters, and Taran Killam was super funny as King George. After the show, I bought the original Broadway cast soundtrack, and have yet to stop listening to it. During the show, I, for some reason, felt super proud being the son of 2 immigrants who worked their tails off to make it in America, and the show does a good job not only telling the story of Alexander Hamilton, but honoring those who sacrifice all to be part of the American narrative. Not only that, there are some bomb-a$$ rap battles! *air horn sounds*Anxiously waiting for them to release a live video recording of the show, or waiting to see if I can somehow get tickets again. If you haven't seen it, you definitely need to. But you didn't need me to tell you that. You want to be in the room where it happens.",105,0.9979

425,25,12,5.0,"Hill & Dale provides one of the best bar experiences yet you would find this to be one of the most unsuspecting bars in the area. I first learned of Hill & Dale at an elite event few years back. My second visit was for my birthday party last year. I was taking a bit of a gamble on this one, a venue I have been only once. Though I was so glad I did. It was perhaps one of the best venues I hosted a birthday. No hassle whatsoever and with drinks and food a flowing. I can say if they can cater so well to a large party, regular service must only equate or exceed.I was looking for a classy cocktail bar venue that accomodated at least 20 people throughout a Friday evening with a fair priced menu of food and drink. Not easy to find in the city at all without a large price tag to come along with it. With a bit of handy internet research though, Hill & Dale proved the best option, and suspicious at first -- 2 hours open bar of beer and wine for $20/per person plus an entire room reserved only for us, without an extra charge. A minimum number of guests was the only main requirement (15-20ppl~). A bright colored wristband was distributed to each of my guests who participated in the bar special, so it was easy to spot. We sat and stood around a nicely adorned space of exposed brick by a non functioning fireplace conveniently adjacent to the bar, so ordering drinks was never an issue. The beer menu included craft and was not limited to your typical Sam Adams or Bud Lite. There was a choice of different wines. The food menu was their regular menu of bar fare. Couches and sofas were in our comfortably cozy area, so seating was never an issue. A waitress came by several times to ask if we needed food and cleaned our tables throughout the two hours. Tater tots anyone? Can't beat a bar that serves tater tots. Food was delicious aside all things. Music was great and not an obnoxious playlist of your typical mainstream pop songs. Not bad at all Hill & Dale. Not bad at all. In fact, it was all so much better than I was expecting.I was completely astonished by the great service and hospitality provided that Friday evening for such a large group of people, but not limited to just us. The bar was bustling with customers as the night went on, but things were running very smoothly for myself and my guests. My friends were asking how I found this place. A few friends left more than just a little happy. For this amazing birthday experience, Hill & Dale remains somewhere on top of the list. I speak highly of their service for a large birthday party. With that in mind, I feel strongly that normal service can only go the same way. Last note, beer and wine is an option always, but definitely try the cocktails. Hill & Dale is built on a reputation of some delicious mixed drinks of quality ingredients. All in all, I find little to no reason to complain about this place and hopefully all types of occasions will be as wonderful as I had experienced.",28,0.9971
426,18,10,5.0,"$50 omakase for 12 pieces of sushi and you need to eat it in 30 min in an outdoor shack like setting. Somehow none of these seem to go together, yet it was a great experience and I was actually full after.Came in on 12/21/16 for 2pm lunch (rsvp the day before around 4pm via texting that number). We actually arrived a few minutes before our reservation, and were seated while another couple finished up. There are 4 seats facing the chefs and 2 on the side (but I don't think those are for the omakase, more for the people waiting for their takeout). There was a toasty heat lamp above our seats so if you're in the middle you'll be fine. My fiance was sitting on the edge so his left arm was a little chilled by the end of our meal. The chairs are also covered with thick, fuzzy scarves so that kept my butt from freezing on the metal chairs. Food:Some repeats (tuna, wagyu, and salmon) but they were two different types of tuna and one wagyu was combined w/ uni. Each piece is made in front of you and the flaming of the tuna and wagyu is so exciting. I was slow and had to feed my camera before I ate, but the chefs would wait patiently until I finished each piece before placing the next one for my fiance and me. They never rushed you and they would tell you what each piece is as it is placed on your plate. They also put in a bit of wasabi under each piece of fish. Everything is so flavorful already so you don't even need the extra soy saucy they offer. There is an optional wagyu and uni handroll for a $12 supplement at the end of the meal. Somehow these two went really well together. Overall, this is a great place for a quick splurge lunch or with a SO/friend. The experience is and great fish is absolutely worth it.",28,0.9824

Steak and Meat lovers must come here for their mixed grill for two. Amazing! All incredible w the tender mouthwatering short ribs, steak, chicken breast, chorizo. Noticed they did not give sweetbreads mentioned on the menu but also included a small mixed green salad and creamy, delicious mashed potatoes (or french fries).The traditional chocolate filled crepe dessert was divine. Creamy chocolate inside and a slightly crisped crepe with ice cream on top. Amazing!Drinks. Extensive drink menu, but I wasn't thrilled w the first one I ordered. My fault as I failed to notice all the ingredients on the one I ordered which was bitter, sour, not sweet . They nicely accommodated and made an amazing sweet old fashioned instead - wonderful. Red Wines I've had here have also been good.Ambiance. Lively feeling often with a full house, tables a little close for me but I haven't minded here as I usually would. Grill of the kitchen somewhat open so you can see and smell the amazing food and steak cooking.Great music playing in the background I noticed as the crowd cleared and my mood turned from not a great one earlier to wanting to dance. Thanks to the great vibe, music and drinks.A few years ago I was here for A low key but very nice New Years Eve. They offered a champagne toast and just enough cheer without being over the top.

I love coming during the daytime the most, since the crowd is a lot smaller and their lunch menu offers a wide variety of main and side dishes. Perfect for those who want to have a little bit of everything! Did I mention that the lunch options are also extremely affordable?

The service was excellent, and the sommelier selected a fantastic bottle of wine for us. Wish I could remember the name. We tried several items off the menu from each category. Everything was delicious and I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with any of it. The menu is great, and quality of the food is excellent.

434,13,7,5.0,"I think I've been on a roll with 5-star reviews. Perhaps I might be too generous in handing out those stars. But it was really TOUGH for me to find anything critical at this hole-in-the-wall. The eatery is meant best for takeaway service or a quick bite. There's very limited seating and not even enough room to stand. The kitchen/staff area takes up roughly half the space in what was formerly a Chinatown floral shop. But I think that's the charm. It's to recreate in these tiny conditions the comforts of a Malaysian coffee shop (kopi tiam) or a house, while giving the customer extensive transparency in seeing how the food is prepared.The food is cheap. Nothing on the menu goes near the $10 mark. A good portion of it is devoted to pastries (kuih), but there are also mini-meals such as nasi lemak (coconut rice with anchovies and a boiled egg for $5.50) or the chilled spicy noodles. I have had the pleasure after seeing this place open near me to visit a couple of times. After eating nasi lemak at least three times, I decided to try the spicy noodles.I enjoyed both a lot. The nasi lemak comes with a generous dollop of coconut rice. The coconut flavor is not that strong. Most of the flavor eventually comes from the anchovies and the sambal spicy sauce. Condiments such as cucumber give a refreshing taste, especially after eating the sambal. I'm not Malaysian so I might be unorthodox for doing this: I usually mix the rice with the sambal and the anchovies, counter to my usual OCD ways. The spicy noodles are served at room temperature with cucumber and a boiled egg. I asked the owner to swap the egg for cucumber. The cucumber again gives a cool and refreshing taste and the soup came to surprise. One would hardly associate something served room temperature with something spicy. It was an interesting combination that I think they pulled off well.At my most recent visit, I had the opportunity to learn more about the owner when she gave her story. She's very nice and is a very sociable person. Her parents owned a restaurant in Malaysia and she compared the experiences of her owning her own place. She described how she imported the bowls were imported from Malaysia. The owner's chatty and relaxed vibe matches what would be expected from a coffee house or someone's house. A slower pace, a break from the hustle and bustle of the city, some place to really warm up and talk to someone, all while sipping on quality coffee and eating some of the dishes for cheap.I find it near impossible to criticize any aspect of the place. Perhaps one might say that I was too generous with my 5-star rating, but I stand by with what I said.",26,0.9939

Although they have moved a few blocks away the recipes are all the same and are basically the best you could find in the area. I'm not joking, this place is truly amazing. Its small but packs a serious punch.The display isn't a mile long which is a good thing because small batches mean everything fresh and never days old. You could taste the difference in ingredients that Huascar uses in his unique cupcakes, they're different in a good way. Gianduja, Guiness, Cayenne. Next level cupcake action. Move over crumbs.On my last visit I had the mini oreo cheesecake. First off they come in mason jars, who doesn't like mason jars?! The cheesecake was just right, not too airy but not too heavy.

436,91,66,5.0,"Warning to all that love to crunch on nuts. I had no idea that almonds are one of the hardest nuts to chew. I know now! I can't remember the last time I had a cavity. I floss and brush after each meal. I'm a fanatic! Well, I still lost a tooth from crunching hard almonds and other nuts for the past few years. Eating lunch I felt a crack in my molar. Split that tooth in half down the middle! No pain but very uncomfortable to eat. You never let a cracked tooth go or bacteria gets in. Very serious. The next day I went to the dentist to see if my tooth could be saved. The answer was no! Their in home oral surgeon was not available for a week and a half. Knowing how sick I've been recently I asked if they could recommend someone I might be able to see sooner. They referred me to Doctor Tuchman and even made the appointment. He saw me the next morning at 9am! Unheard of typically for me. By the time I arrived home from the dentist I had an email confirming my appointment and instructions to complete the patient Medical Questionaire on line. I did so with ease and was amazed at the high tech process. Excellent! I immediately received a conformation from the office. The young lady I had spoken to on the phone earlier handled everything for Doctor Tuchman. Also included in the email were the detailed instructions pre oral surgery and my options for anesthesia! Plus steps for post surgery care of the extraction site. Next morning I arrived at the office. Very comfortable and clean. I didn't even have the opportunity to sit and the young lady I had been communicating with came over introduced herself and handled my introduction to the dental assistant. Very nice assistant took me to my chair and explained a few things prepping me for surgery. In a couple minutes Doctor Tuchman arrived. He took his time explaining in detail all of my options and very patiently answering my questions. I naturally selected local anesthetic. No ones putting me to sleep at my age! I failed to tell him I'm very susceptible to drugs. He over did it with three shots. I was numb for seven hours or more! I must say either I'm nerve dead or he is super good at extractions. I did not have any pain after. The jaw was a little swollen. I used ice packs which they provide and they provided gause for bleeding. I turned down prescription for pain reliever. I get very sick from those. I may have taken a couple Tylenol. As I said I never had any pain. The following day Doctor Tuchman called and we also emailed back and forth with any questions or concerns I had. The extraction was on a Wednesday. On Friday he contacted me by phone one last time to see how I was doing. He reassured me I could email if needed him over the weekend or the following week. I received Wonderful Caring Treatment throughout the whole process. I would highly recommend Doctor Tuchman. I know if I'm still living in Manhattan and need oral surgery I will go to Doctor Tuchman. Since I don't have dental insurance it set me back a couple months of my monthly budget allowance! Manhattan prices are a killer! If you want the best care bring a fat wallet! Or excellent credit!Just remember avoid hard nuts. When I did some research on line there's been a recent epidemic of broken and split teeth from almonds. Don't let this happen to you!",99,0.9686
437,13,7,5.0,"I have to say, I was fairly impressed with this place and will give it a 5 stars rating. After reading all the yelp reviews, I decided to come here. Best to make reservations. I made a reservation for 2 for 5:30pm since the popular times were all taken up, especially counter seats of course. This is omakase style sushi, which is what I was looking for. There were 5 options I believe. Think it was a 12, 13, 15, 18, or 20 piece sushi + sashimi. We opted for the 20 piece + sashimi omakase ($180 pp). They give you a couple of appetizers which were all pretty good. There was a soup and ice cream mochi for dessert in this set. The sashimi that came with this course were really good. Fish was fresh of course. Wouldn't have expected anything less if I'm paying $180 pp. I thought the sashimi was very little for the price. I think the 18 piece sushi with no sashimi was $150pp. So for an extra $30, I only had like 6 pieces of fish, 3 different kinds (tuna, clam and red snapper). Nonetheless, it was really good, no regrets. The red snapper was my favorite of them all. Although I don't remember a lot of the fishes I tried, I really enjoyed the Hokkaido uni compared with the Santa Barbara uni. He was nice enough to let me try the Hokkaido one...wow. Probably the best uni I've ever had to be honest. I really enjoyed this place because they gave such a huge variety of different fish selections so I never got bored. I've been to some omakase places in NY where they do not give as many different selections. They will use the same types of fishes and just serve it a different way. This restaurant is very small, very intimate. I also liked that they had a small cup with a wet towel for people who wanted to eat the sushi with their hands instead of chopsticks. That was something small, but new to me. The fish was so good and fresh that eating it with soy sauce would be completely wrong. You just put each whole piece in your mouth as is, no soy sauce (not like the American way of eating ""sushi."") Don't come here expecting dragon rolls or California rolls. This is the real sushi/sashimi stuff. If you want dragons rolls and all that, stick to your ""Japanese"" restaurants owned by Chinese people lol. Great experience here. I would def come back some day. Expensive, but great quality fish.",23,0.992
438,22,12,5.0,"This has been on my wishlist for over a year. We were overly-ambitious that night, as we had had a few drinks and appetizers somewhere else before wandering in to O Ya out of the cold. O Ya definitely deserves to be THE star of the night, so we won't make that mistake again. It was a Wednesday night, and we had a reservation for around 9:15pm. The staff welcomed us kindly though we were a bit late. The ambience was lovely, the lightning warm, the decor charming. The tiny ""chopsticks rests"" were adorable, some were in the shapes of cute animals and we loved the whale and kitty ones. The server humorously mentioned that they used to have panda-shaped ones, but they ""disappeared"" to new homes, haha. Though the omakase was tempting as always, I'm glad we kept it to a few a la carte choices. The presentation was stellar, and everything tasted heavenly. Lots of delicious truffle choices. We had some lovely champagne to start, because you know, bubbly goes with everything in life. The bluefin chutoro with the herb sauce was one of the stars, as was the scallop truffle. I do believe the truffle scented uni nigiri was possible the best uni I've ever put in my mouth. Ever. I mean, I'm not saying I've had a lot of uni but still. Really. Everything just melted in our mouths, felt like heaven really. I kept wondering if I really was still alive, I might have pinched myself once or twice. For one of the only times in my life ever, I would have skipped the dessert, though the mochi donuts were interesting. It's just that everything else was too good. It's perhaps too extravagant to wish to come back for the 24-course, but. It's Christmas, and a girl can dream.",26,0.9974

Instead of having so many updates, I decided to combine the last several visits into one. It has constantly being really busy, with its fun theme, good food and coffee. The only time it was not full was the day of snow storm. When most businesses and schools were closed for the day due to the severe weather, Rue La Rue Café was open! Thank you for being a dedicated café...!We have been there for several Saturdays now, and it is constantly busy. Also, they have had musicians there on every Saturdays so far, which is really cool. They always have a pianist, and one accompanying string musician like a cellist or a guitarist. Nice to have a live music while you are enjoying a brunch.They have some glasses with Golden Girls design in gold (of course), I believe for sale. I don't think they serve their coffee or any drinks in it, since I haven't seen it used inside the café for customers. it would be fun, yes, but it probably is more cost effective to NOT use fancy glasses like that, as the design can fade faster in a commercial grade, powerful dish washer.So, over the last several visits, we had Adult Mac & Cheese, Betty White Cake, Blanche's Raspberry Cheesecake, Chocolate Cheesecake, Mrs. Naugatuck's Curry Chicken Sandwich, Sophia's Amaretto Cheesecake, Strawberry Cheesecake, Tomato Mishmash in a Bread Bowl, and a Waffle with Strawberry Butter. Jealous? I know, I would be too...We have not come across anything that we didn't like. Everything was tasty, and I can see that they are all crafted with care. This also means that food does not come out right away, but I prefer them to make the food to order, and with love. I saw a customer who was so impatient and kind of rude, because they ordered a hot dish and it didn't come out within few minutes... If it came out so fast, that meant it was already made, and sitting there for a while. Here, the food might take a bit longer you'd like, but you are getting something that is made for you, and only you. So, please come with a little more patience.The staffs here are nice, not all ""friendly"" but most of them are very nice and attentive. One of the staffs took a really good care of the demanding customers I mentioned above, with great patience and poise.

Doughnut Plant is Dunkin Donuts on crack: softer, fluffier, with less of the sugary sweet aftertaste. I still felt like I needed a kale salad and a green juice after eating but it was one of the few much-hyped, Instagrammed food that is absolutely worth it. My office ordered a few boxes of donuts for a holiday party and I unabashedly stuck a few in my bag to take home for my boyfriend to try, they were just that unbelievably good. Still moist even after sitting in my bag too. The standouts were: 1) the peanut butter and banana combo (why isn't this a more common combination?) and 2) the Christmas tree donut (mint and chocolate).

I have wanted to come to Bouley for many many years- finally I, very luckily got to come here recently, not once, but twice for lunch! The whole restaurant is just simply stunning. From the entrance and wall of apples (it smells so amazing btw), lush waiting area, to the upstairs dining and also private dining room downstairs- the visual experience is already very stimulating, all before you have even received your first course. The first time I lunched here, we were seated in the downstairs private room. It was like being taken to a European library- very charming and quaint and my second time here, we were seated in the upstairs main dining room. Both are beautiful in their own ways and you will not be disappointed in either dining areas. The whole restaurant has accents and furniture imported from a French Monastery. While you await your order to arrive, they have a wonderful bread cart. I don't even like bread but I tried a few different fresh breads- my favorite has black currant in it. I started with the porcini flan, made with Golden princess and Alaskan dungeness crab, black truffle dashihad. It was filing and also very tasty. For my main entree, I ordered the organic duck which had Organic Maine einkorn grain and young sprouts,with New York State foie gras braised in red Burgundy duck which I highly recommend. To finish up the meal with dessert, I recommend the chocolate cake- it delightfully oozes with fudge or avocat- ananas which is Pineapple-wasabi sorbet, fresh avocado, miso sponge cake, sesame tuile. For a light martini, if you enjoy apples (I mean, they have a lot of apples here..) I loved la pomme. Overall, both meals here were excellent as was the impeccable service. As expected, both meals were delightful and it only makes me sad that they are set to shutter in early 2017. P.S. for the ladies, don't forget your gift with the hostess at the end of the meal! The delicious lemon pound cake is a great way to enjoy a little bit of Bouley at home. Michelin *",22,0.9984
444,15,12,5.0,"I was super impressed with Eatsa! I was excited to try it, but since it's their first few days open in this location I had expected there might be a few issues, but there weren't. So the basic concept is that you go in and order from an iPad (or you can order from their app) and once it's ready you go pick it up from a little cubby. It's also relatively healthy with all the bowls being either quinoa or salad based, and there doesn't appear to be any meat on the menu (FYI), and pretty inexpensive. I had downloaded the app and previewed the menu and options, but I actually wanted to go in and see what it was like. The only human interaction with people working there was them guiding you to the iPad and asking you to move over while you wait. You don't even really need any help since it's so simple. You can choose a bowl, and then customize it to your liking, or just customize a bowl from scratch. I went with the smoke house salad, and was able to take out the things I didn't want and add in the things I did. Super easy! And I really don't even think I had to wait 5 minutes for it to be ready. There was a small crowd of people, nothing really too crazy, but all the food seemed to come out really fast. There was a small area, high counter, for eating, but I took it back to my office to eat. Everything in it seemed really fresh, and it was so good! I'm happy this opened down the block from my office. Hopefully it won't get too crazy when more people discover it, but I'll definitely be back!",26,0.9965

A casual but refined relaxing atmosphere just below Madison Square park, with dark walls, bar dining and booths, which became the mantra of many of the hipster joints one sees in Brooklyn these days. Reliable, though elevated, with comfort food menu items i.e. Buttermilk fried chicken, Louisiana shrimp and grits,Veal ricotta meatballs, Short ribs etc.Sadly, due to a 50% rent increase raising it to $60k per month, Craftbar will be closing its doors April 15, 2017.  *We look forward to visiting Tom Colicchio's latest restaurant in the Beekman Hotel further downtown in the Financial District, named Fowler & Wells.

There is also a bench outside.Cute scruffy hipster baristas with black blocky glasses, dyed blue hair and throw on out of bed wardrobes blast out deep rich joe.

447,30,18,5.0,"One of the few places I ever expected to find myself at was Le Bernardin. Why? Well, as a child growing up, I abhorred seafood and fish of any kind; it was partially derived from being exposed to a limited number of dishes, but mostly due to my stubborn nature - but I digress [1]. But for those looking to truly find some of the best seafood in New York City, Le Bernardin should be at the top of the list. The accolades are numerous, including a consistent string of 3 Michelin stars, four NYT stars, and a near-perfect Zagat score, and Chef Eric Ripert is considered by many to be one of the best chefs of his time. His philosophy is printed clearly on each of the menus at the restaurant: ""The fish is the star of the plate.""The dining options at Le Bernardin are also quite generous, with options available for lunch and dinner, and allow diners to choose between a number of prix fixe menus and a la carte dishes. While it's certainly possible to have a fairly extravagant meal, we opted to come in the middle of the day for a slightly more scaled back but nonetheless comprehensive experience. Reservations were made a month in advance as well, although the availability of tables during lunch seem to be better than at dinner. Regardless, tit's best to come prepared as it's far from just a casual dining experience.The meal will start diners off with a choice of bread from their bread tray, as well as an amuse bouche; we were treated to a generous salmon rillette paired with the buttery thin toast points. From the three course prix fixe, I opted for the Seafood Truffle Pasta and was presented with one of most beautiful (and fragrant) pasta dishes I have yet to find. The tagliatelle pasta was cooked to just the right texture and bite, but played second fiddle to the tender pieces of crab, lobster, and scallop that highlighted the dish. All the components were lightly coated in a black truffle emulsion that imparted a distinct flavor in the sauce but held back from overpowering the entire dish. For those looking for something a little lighter and brighter, the Langoustine and Sea Urchin was a similarly gorgeous dish, featuring a thin langoustine ""carpaccio"" studded with generous servings of sea urchin, all balanced out with a sweet and tart nori-apple vinaigrette.Originally for my main, I had decided on the Pan Roasted Cod, which was served with a Coq au Vin sauce. Upon my first bite into the dish, however, I was taken aback at the acidity in the sauce which wasn't balanced out by anything else in the dish. Our server, upon noting my hesitation at the dish, immediately inquired if everything was all right, and I told him that I found the sauce too sharp for my tastes; he immediately had the dish sent back to the kitchen (informing me that the red wine in the coq au vin sauce could be sometimes overwhelming) and offered a suggestion for an alternative, the Black Bass ""Surf and Turf"". The latter option was, I'm happy to say, one of the best seafood dishes I've yet to have, which paired a perfectly cooked filet of black bass with braised veal cheek. The dish was dotted with several portions of a creamy, light parsnip emulsion and an aromatic broth that featured ginger and a five spice reduction. I can still recall how perfectly crisp and thin the skin on the bass was, how tender the veal was to cut into, and how beautifully the parsnip paired with the lightly spiced broth... While I can't speak to the entire menu at Le Bernardin, it's impossible to go wrong with this dish, and it's one I'm glad I did wind up with.As for dessert, I ended up going with the Black Walnut, a beautifully plated dish that featured a cylinder of Baba au Scotch cake (traditionally cooked with rum, but traditions are meant to be broken), caramelized banana, and a quennelle of black walnut ice cream. It was surprisingly balanced, with the darker, nuttier flavors contrasting well with the coolness and lightness of the ice cream. I think my preference may lie with the Slow-Roasted Pear, however, which took a perfectly poached pear and uniquely elevated it with a ""beurre noisette"" tuile and a frozen pear parfait. It was a truly refreshing, perfectly sweet dessert that featured the pear in numerous forms and textures.I don't think I need to touch too much on the elegance and refinement of the dining room, and the professionalism and attentiveness of the service at Le Bernardin. In actuality, this review is probably more redundant than anything else - but if there is one takeaway from it, let it be this: Go. There is good reason that Le Bernardin stands the test of time and continues to be seen by many as one of the best restaurants in the city, if not the world. It is a fitting 500th review (at least in my opinion) and I can only hope to return one day to experience the full dinner service.--[1] Rest assured that since moving to NYC, this has been nearly completely rectified.",31,0.9995
448,19,5,5.0,"I'm so glad this place is here!Corvo has been open for about a month now, and in that time, they've had a promotion where EVERY item on their menu is $2. Every. Single. Item. That includes all their coffee products as well as their pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and other goodies. I keep going every day, thinking the promotion will end soon, but it's been a solid month and prices are still the same. So not only are the prices great, but get this: the coffee is too. They use La Colombe beans and turn out solid lattes, regular coffee, flat whites, or anything you're in the mood for. Best of all, the service is friendly and efficient. I occasionally ask for mochas or flavored lattes with very little syrup, and they have always been happy to accommodate. I've never been disappointed with either my drink or the service. Part of me hopes that Corvo will stay a secret, but part of me is happy to see more people discover it!",31,0.993
449,23,21,5.0,"If wine enthusiasts ask ""Bordeaux or Burgundy?,"" Pho enthusiasts similarly ask ""Northern or Southern Style?"" My answer to the latter is always ""Northern"" (Pho Bac). Hanoi House is the only NYC representative, so far, that makes Pho Bac. (---- I must mention that this review is a long, but personally special one to me. Because I am finally writing a review about Pho as a Vietnamese! To create a certain credibility of this review, I need to mention my background. I am not the Vietnamese who grew up with Orange County's cuisine, but the Vietnamese who spent the entire childhood in Vietnam, where I often had Pho Bac (Northern-Style-Pho) made by people from the North. Basically what I am trying to say is - I know what I'm talking about. ----)Back to the opening question - ""Northern or Southern?"" Why is it so crucial for this review? It is because the majority (or may I dare saying ""all"") of Pho in NYC is the Southern-Style-Pho. The kind of Pho videos you see on Youtube by Zagat, Munchies, even Asians like Fung Bros are videos about Southern-Style-Pho! The only popular video-documented Northern-Style-Pho appeared on Anthony Bourdain's show. There is nothing wrong about your choice of style, but if I liked Bordeaux and you served only Burgundy, there's a less chance that I'd come back, right?-------Here are some main differences--------- Northern (Pho Bac): traditional Noodles: flat, soft / Soup: clear, cooked from cow bones / Taste: mildly sweet (bland) + a hint of black pepper and ginger / Meat: chicken or fat beef to compromise with the soup / Addition to serving: Chinese cruller + pickled garlic / Portion: medium bowl + lots of scallions / Location: local Northern Vietnam-- Southern (Pho Nam): Noodles: chewy / Soup: cloudy, cooked from cow, chicken bones, and sometimes dried seafood / Taste: sweet + rich / Meat: doesn't matter lean or fat (the dish is highly fat anyway) / Addition to serving: sriracha + hoisin + side veggies / Portion: humongous bowl + sprinkled scallions / Location: anywhere in the world but local Northern VietnamHanoi House's Pho is not perfectly authentically Northern (Hanoi). The most distinctive difference of the 2 styles is the noodles. The noodles Hanoi House use are absolutely not Northern, but considering the Northern noodles are handmade and no restaurant wants to pioneer, I probably shouldn't demand. The soup, on the other hand, is the r-e-a-l d-e-a-l. A very important point to mention here is their price points. Some people really (really?) need to complain about spending $13 for a Pho. My total combo of a Pho + bone marrow + chinese cruller + tip were $20. If you can pay $13 for a ramen or a pasta, what's so wrong about a $13 Pho?! Preached about your health then demanded less than $13 for an MSG meal. Only idiots would expect a less-than-$13 dinner in a neat, top-service restaurant in East Village.",44,0.9934
450,31,15,5.0,"This review is primarily for the galette des rois! Yes, every year around January 6th French people enjoy the galette des rois tradition. Even after January 6th many bakeries keep the cakes, often even until the end of January when Valentine's stuff starts coming in. So go out and get some galette!!I personally always find it a bit annoying when people say stuff like, ""This Italian place is legit, because my mom's Italian and the pasta sauce is the same!"", etc. Well, sorry, I'm from France and I highly recommend this place. Does this mean somehow that my opinion trumps those of other just 'regular' Americans even if they've personally eaten like 2 bazillion croissants more than me? Well, duh, yes I'm better than you! haha, no just joking. But yes French people can be snobby.This is the best galette I've eaten in a long time. Crunchy and flaky and buttery and light on the outside (as it should, it's puff pastry similar to a croissant) and warm & rich & gooey & almondy on the inside (typical frangipane, same often found in almond croissants). Plus the top design is really nice and the price at $25 (6 person size, $40 for 10 person size) is spot on. Kayser only had a 8 person size and it was $35. Really didn't like the last 2 cakes I bought at Kayser so was very delighted with Mille-Feuille this time.Don't be shy, enjoy the tradition with us! They even sell individual slices. Its basically a giant pie shaped almond croissant, so good!! Oh, if you don't know the tradition involves sharing the pie with friends and the person who finds the 'fève' (bean, usually a figurine) gets the crown and is the king or queen. And if you lose, well just keep buying more galettes until you win the crown like I do!!! lolTo finish off, I've tried other galettes at Kayser, Pain Quotidien, Financier and this is my favorite. Financier is good but basic, Mille-Feuille really kicks it up a notch.As for their other offerings, they are also very good. They have croissants (they even offer private classes, super pricey if you ask me), their namesake mille-feuille, and other standard cakes and viennoiseries. Oh, and yes they have CUPS so make sure you get the CUPS app to get cheaper coffee!I really like Mille-Feuille, so I definitely won't hesitate next time say to buy a bûche de noel from here - yes, another French tradition that Americans really ought to experience and one you guys just missed! Btw, don't buy from Kayser, over-priced and mediocre bûches. I have really really enjoyed other bûches though from Dominique Ansel and Restaurant Benoit (they do special orders).

Finally, a grocery store with a big selection of fresh produce and a meat section where the meat isn't half-spoiled and all dripping meat juices on itself (looking at you, Key Foods). And the prices don't make you want to straight up punch someone (looking at you, Gristedes).  They even have some bougie staples, like stations for you to grind your own peanut butter and coffee, and a sprawling selection of cheeses. After you've stuffed yourself with cheese and peanut butter, you might be looking to shave some calories, and BOOM -- a wall full of Halo Top ice cream.  You start feeling bad for eating the semi-franken food that is Halo Top, and lo and behold -- another wall full of nourishing Bob's Red Mill products.  You decide you don't actually feel that bad about eating franken-food, and HEY-O -- aisles of fun snack foods (have you ever tried coconut jerky? I hadn't either before discovering it at this wonderful gem of a grocery store). My point is, you can find everything you need, and also everything you don't need but will thoroughly enjoy, right here on 160th St. The service is great and the manager (who I swear is always working) has a frankly admirable amount of hustle in his heart.

For a party of 6 that made no reservations, we waited about 40min, which is good for a Friday night at 730pm. As for their beverages, I highly recommend their jasmine tea (one pot gives your about 6 cups of tea) because it offers a refreshing taste when paired with your appetizer or entree. For the appetizer, we got both their papaya salad and Mieng Kum. Their Mieng Kum (shrimp leaf-wrapped bite-size) was a fun way to start the meal with your friends, where they give you 5 bite sized portions served on top of shot glasses. Not only is the dish visually appealing, but the bite sized portions offer a great burst of authentic Thai flavors such as ginger fresh red onions, shrimp, and coconut. For the entree, I hands down recommend their Ped Ron (crispy five spice duck). Upon receiving the dish, you could immediately tell how delicious and expertly plated the dish was. The duck was cooked to perfection, with the tender duck simply falling apart in your mouth upon biting it. The dish is paired with a sweet honey-soy dressing, which I found to be pleasant but not necessary to enjoy the taste of the duck. Overall, the beauty of the restaurant and dishes alone should be enough to draw you in for a meal. I would highly recommend Thai Villa for a special event or an intimate date night.",27,0.9945

She and her colleague work hard, do a perfect job, and are so accommodating as they are happy to text to make appointments and are so flexible on timings. Before I came to Jane, I saw the bigger places in K-town like Ebenezar and I just feel like the work doesn't compare. Jane is meticulous, detailed-oriented and she is very personable- whenever I have her lashes; with good care they last as long as 3-4 weeks! She has all different lengths, curl types, thin/thick and will advise you on what's best for you. She is skilled at mixing different types of lashes, and the lashes never hurt or feel tight.  She will personalize whatever look you want! She is really so sweet and her demeanor is so relaxing that I always somehow fall asleep...;).

A carnitas burrito and margarita cleanse do wonders for your face, like making it look more trustworthy, and other such traits. I discovered the carnitas benedict recently and -- let me tell ya -- it left my taste buds more balanced and focused.One side benefit of going burrito between taco cleanses is that it elevates my mood with these simple, crispy sweet potato fries.

The line is extremely intimidating as it's usually out the door every night, but don't worry - they move quick here. I would not recommend coming here in groups of more than 4... it's an optimal if you have a party of 2 and they can seat you quicker. Our wait for 2 on a Saturday evening was around 15-20 minutes, which is amazing.The atmosphere reminds me of a restaurant in Chinatown or something - they want you out as fast as possible to serve other people, so service is a little rushed and frantic. I wouldn't come here expecting too much out of service, but they still get the job done. I don't mind... that just means I get seated faster! Overall service is acceptable, but could be better. The restaurant is loud and bustling, but not so much to the point where you feel the need to scream over the table to talk. The music is top-40 which is interesting for a restaurant on this street.I've eaten here a couple times now and each time, the food has been amazing. I love me some soups and stews and Five Senses has a ton to choose from. Their Seolleongtang (ox bone broth), mul naengmyeon (cold noodles in broth), and yukgaejang (spicy beef stew) were all very flavorful and some of the best I've had, especially the cold noodles. They are a little pricier than their competitors, but I guess you pay for the quality and the servings are pretty large. I have also had the spicy double fried chicken and it's comparable, if not better, than your usual Kyochon or Bonchon - the outside is very, very crispy and it packs a lot more heat than it looks.Come for the food, ignore the dodgy service (I gave them the benefit of the doubt), and keep returning, because this stuff's the real deal.",29,0.9899

Sometimes just fresh, high-quality ingredients speak for themselves.Maine Uni Crudo - Uni is the new bacon apparently! If you see an item on the menu with uni, you just order it. Icelandic Arctic Char - AWESOME. This was my entree. The fish was prepared perfectly tender with the white miso sauce balanced nicely against the radishes and grapefruit.

When a work buddy and I got the hankering for Korean, we naturally made a beeline to K-Town. None of the joints on West 32nd were calling out to us. We whipped out our magic devices and voila, Don's was only another block's walk.DB is a classy joint, with an upmarket decor perfect for business lunch. The restaurant is spacious and larger than the storefront would suggest. We were led to the back area, which was a tad more casual. The seating is interesting: they have these tatami-like seats with cushions that kind of look subterranean, with your lower limbs disappearing into the floor. Actually, it's quite a snug fit in there.As in other Korean eateries, service was brisk. We got the banchan as soon as we ordered, munching on wonderful nibbles like sauteed spinach, several pickled veggies, and even dry fish flakes (at least that's what I think it was). The lunch specials are excellent, ranging from $12-$16 with a choice of stew (more of a soup). I opted for the DON special (pork belly with stew and rice) accompanied by Haemul-sundubu (spicy seafood and tofu broth). We ordered a couple of Cass lagers (Friday afternoon!) and had a leisurely lunch. I came away very happy. Don's is good eating and stands out from an already very good pack of K-Town restaurants.",22,0.9956

468,44,32,5.0,"It's been sometime since I've been to a lounge with a DJ that really DJ's. I've been to many in the past, but the DJ at bOb doesn't try squeezing in portions of 12-18 songs within 3.5 minutes. DJ Mika, though seemingly a bit shy, throws a punch with her playlist. I did a teeny bit of DJing and hung out with DJ's back in the day so I know how I like it done. She mixed things up and included some non-commercial radio, hardcore hip-hop from back in the day. It was a breath of fresh air not hearing the same ol' commercial hip hop standards and I have a feeling if she could, she would go deeper into her list of hardcore hits. As most have mentioned, bOb is small, but wasn't too small for us, we took advantage of the space early before the masses headed in and the a/c was pumping providing ample ventilation. Bathroom's are cute as cute goes, set-up has the one sink placed on the outside of the toilet areas, more as a necessity as space is limited. Bartending and busser service was great for us, but certain as the evening progresses things no doubt will get less ventilated, with less room to dance and slower service. But no matter, this is a great spot with a very diverse crowd to dance and dance and dance. Miss Evelin and I finally made it here and we will be back; all are welcome to join if schedules allow. I know my dancing feet are quite happy and will be shuffling my way back to bOb Bar. Happy Hour from 7:00pm-10:00pm$5.00 cover after 10:00pm",52,0.9912

It's an actual restaurant with sitting areas, it's almost never crowded and you definitely get more options than at the cart vendor. PLUS you can take your meal over to Central Park and have an impromptu picnic!I always get myself small gyro platter with extra meat- no rice (""trying"" to be low carb about things) and loads of white sauce. I am always surprised at how generous and filling the portion is! They don't really have the sauce bottles out there for abuse but they really do put on the right amount of sauces - unless you're the type of guy to gorge down a whole bottle of sauce, then this isn't the place for you. They do offer packets of hot sauce for an extra fee, but good lord those are so hot. At least there's also a soda fountain to quench the heat. Sometimes the pay line gets backed up because some patrons either order a large amount or pay in pennies or something. Most times it's a fairly quiet, in and out sort of thing. Either way, beats the long cart line any day.",27,-0.6455
470,26,12,5.0,"New and very nice, very cozy gem of an Irish restaurant. While cozy like an Irish pub, it is way too nice and has too much charm and character to fall into a pub category.A fabulous find just away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square and away from the edge of the heart of Hells Kitchen. Fantastic cozy find for family, friends, anyone.Newly renovated, new owners of a previous place. The original closed, was renovated with fabulous taste by new owners, then closed again shortly after for a short period and now is reopened- about 6 weeks ago -- with new enthusiastic owners. Here they are, definitely a fabulous find.Ambiance. Walked in to the warm cozy spot with brick, wood tables, character in the details and a comfortable cozy living room set up in the back with a sofa, comfortable chairs and fresh orchids. Great music playing and 10 tv screens downstairs alone show games, videos, and the entertaining presidential debates entertaining about 70 people last time. A large screen tv upstairs as well.Food and drink. Happy hour Shiraz was good, and I couldn't resist trying the shepards pie potato skins - creative twist on the original and fantastic . Service. Friendly and fantastic service. Irish Irish Irish.

But go go go!The cast is amazing and embodied Gloria Estefan and Emilio Estefan amazingly well. She literally looked just like young Gloria Estefan. The plot was a little bit of everything- love, music, happiness, tears, laughter, emotions!The theatre itself is nice, clean and well kept. The seats are incredibly close together and if anyone leaves their seat, everyone they pass have to stand. So only little downside but otherwise great. No food is served, just drinks in cute take home souvenir sippy cups hahaThe cast is interactive and upbeat! A great energy and a great show for a date or girls night. I wouldn't recommend it for kids because the costumes are everyday costumes - not much pizazz so might be tough to keep a kid still through it. But otherwise- go go go! Amazing show!!!!",28,0.9903
472,24,13,5.0,"Having lived in NYC for over 7 years now, there's been a noticeable 'good' dim sum drought - so much so that as a Cantonese person, I would wait for trips back home to California, Vancouver, or Hong Kong to fulfill my cravings. Tim Ho Wan, the well known Michelin starred dim sum chain from Hong Kong, was my renewed hope to change that.Today, December 16, is the soft opening, which will last with staggered hours (10am-3pm; 5pm-10pm) until its grand opening date of January 18. I arrived a little after 12pm and was unfortunately told 40 min later that the the couple in front of me would be the last people that would be seated for lunch. I was devastated but the couple in front of me graciously offered to give me their spot in line because they had to go back to work. This was a recurring theme considering I didn't get seated until around 3:30pm so plan accordingly. They do have a name/cell phone service when you check in that will text you when a table is closer to opening up. It seemed to be having issues today but when things calm down, this would be a great help so you don't have to wait around the entire time, and can do some shopping or get a drink nearby.The space isn't the biggest but it feels bright and comfortable. I believe it only seats 60, with tables and booths optimized for 2-4, so no huge round tables here for you and your extended family. I've been to one of the Tim Ho Wan locations in Hong Kong several times and it was also on the smaller side.Despite the craziness of opening day, the staff remained friendly and calm. Front of staff June and Christina were great, along with our server whose name I didn't get but looked like a young Ming Tsai. More surprisingly was how calm the kitchen staff was (viewable through an open kitchen concept). They were focused like a well-oiled machine, and food came out consistently without large waits. I loved the beautiful marble lazy susan that the kitchen staff and wait staff use to exchange food. We did wait a bit for one dish but I think that was due to it not being put in, which has always happened in general at dim sum places with the checklist/tallying order method.Like any dim sum place, you come for what's good and unique to that specific place. The highlight and namesake was of course their Baked BBQ Pork Buns. They came out hot and fresh out of the oven, and were made more delicious because we were so cold and hungry from waiting outside and it was the first thing that arrived at our table. The topping was crisp and lightly sweet and the inside was perfectly seasoned being both sweet and savory like a good char siu. I also noticed some umami / seaweed / dashi flavor at one point. From what I remember, I think the buns here were even better than the ones I had at Tim Ho Wan's HK location.Other highlights were the Shrimp Dumplings (Har Gow) and the Shrimp and Chives in Rice Roll (Har Cherng). The shrimp were really fresh, sweet, and plump. Again these were served super warm and fresh. I generally prefer the Shrimp Rice Rolls to the pork ones, and this was the case here as well since the BBQ Pork Rice Rolls were a bit forgettable and the pork pieces were cut in large chunks that felt out of place in the dish. Also if you have an aversion to cilantro, don't order the BBQ Pork Rice Rolls. It's common for the meat rice rolls at dim sum places to have cilantro and it exists here as well.Fried Turnip Cakes - these were good too. Not the best I've had but decently seared and the ratio of daikon to flour was good and not overly doughy or plasticy at all.Deep Fried Dumplings with Pork and Shrimp - these have always been a favorite of mine. I generally describe these as meat mochi footballs. These don't reheat well so I'd recommend eating them here instead of taking them home.Vegetable Spring Rolls - really good with lots of mushroom flavor. Only downside was these were on the oily side. Could fry these better or let the oil soak out a bit more.Another unique thing here was the French Toast with Custard. It tastes like a fried souffle sandwich filled with custard.I was really impressed overall, especially given that it was the first day of its soft opening. I could feel how much work was put into the desire for this place to be successful - from the food to the service. I went into this experience just hoping to have a solid dim sum place finally in NYC, but somehow I left feeling happier than I expected. I wasn't expecting to have a sense of camaraderie in line with fellow diners, or that I would feel a sense of warmth from all of the staff especially with how crazy busy today was (you know what I mean when you're accustomed to Chinese or dim sum restaurants where attitude and annoyance is the norm). But it reminded me that the essence of dim sum really is a place to rest, gather with loved ones, and warm your heart (and belly).",32,0.9994

474,23,11,5.0,"AB-SO-LUTELY. YUP!I am extremely picky with high-end Michelin-type restaurants. I eat at about 3 per week and am mostly unimpressed. I was told that GK was a game changer and quite good. I figured that I had to check it out!First of all, the presentation was amazing. I was blown away. I have eaten at Alinea (in Chicago) where they give you a helium balloon made of apple for dessert and everything is extremely well presented. In NYC I've eaten at almost all of the 3 Michelin starred restaurants and a huge handful of the 1 & 2 starred.GK for NYC takes the cake. In my opinion, it's better than 11 Madison Park, absolutely.I had a cocktail with watermelon and basil which was so light and refreshing. It started my evening off on the most positive note. I have a stomach issue and have extreme reactions especially to acidic drinks, so it was awesome to be able to choose from a menu with an extensive selection of juices and cocktails to choose from.The staff was great. There was one hiccup where a course was swapped (I received the wrong plate and had to switch), but I didn't mind it one bit. Other than that, everything was perfect from start to finish. The waiter had great recommendations and was very accommodating to my stomach issue. It's refreshing because even in some of the very high-end establishments, waiters are not briefed on what allergies mean what (for instance, a lot of the times when I say I have a stomach sensitivity to acid, they bring me a drink with grapefruit or OJ in it which are both extremely acidic). Awesome to know we were in good hands!Now on to the food+ Cured Tasmanian Ocean Trout with sweet peas * parma prosciutto * dill - MUST ORDER. Absolutely heavenly. I tried some of the other starters and this was by far the best.+ FOIE GRAS - Perfectly seared and heavenly. I'm a HUGE fan. + Grilled Maine Lobster - Also heavenly.+ Awakening * Strawberry Rhubarb with poached rhubarb * buttermilk panna cotta * strawberry sorbet - Again, perfect.There were some little things that the waiter brought out (for instance, palate cleansers) which were extremely well presented and tasty. I almost don't even want to post pictures to ruin the surprise.

476,17,10,5.0,"What can I say about sushi nakazawa? It is an absolutely amazing experience. Before i make this TLDR, I want to start with the tips. How do I make reservation? You can reserve 30 days in advance online on opentable. MAKE SURE YOU GET ONLINE AT 12:00AM (midnight) 30 days in advance if you want sushi bar experience. Sushi bar or dining room table? I HIGHLY suggest sushi bar experience. Chef Nakazawa interacts directly with those at the sushi bar telling us history behind the different types of sushi and we can take pictures of the entire experience. Also - you can watch all the sous chefs prepping and how they work in tandem. At an extra 30 dollars - it's worth it especially for those who like to take pictures!Designated Times for Sushi Bar - 5pm and 9:30pm. whichever one you decide, make sure to get there 5-10 minutes early as you want to get the center seat right in front of chef nakazawa. Get used to eating with your hand - if you didn't know already - each item is offered one at a time with the correct amount of wasabi in it already and you pick it up with your fingers. i repeat - eat with your fingers. The chopsticks are offered to pick up a slice of ginger to cleanse the palate and prep yourself for the next piece. Don't worry for germ lovers - a finger napkin is provided to wipe your fingers after each sushi piece. Sushi Bar Experience When you walk in - you find the place stunning and it lives up to it's 4 money signs. The place is immaculate. All staff is super cordial. They slide all chairs in/out for you. All staff are wearing business professional (aka suits) and well groomed. The staff is just on point with everything in terms of refilling waters, coming by and asking if we need anything else. The omakase is a 21 piece SUSHI (sorry - need to eat rice for those non-carb eaters). The items are offered one at a time. Chef Nakazawa does an amazing job explaining what type of fish each one he is offering us and tends to interact with the sushi bar really well. He does a good job walking back and forth so everyone can have a fair shot and see what he is pointing at. The sushi is just immaculate. The fish is indescribable. 60% of the fish is from Japan and are changed seasonally based on Japan's weather and depending on what's fresh out there. The other 40% is domestic. I don't know how much I can rave if you have read this far but the craftsmanship by Chef Nakazawa and his staff are absolute artist when it comes to the sushi. Each piece is amazingly laid out. My favorite piece was teh egg custard sushi. This is probably what he is known best for. For those who watched Jiro Dreams of SUshi - Chef Nakazawa was the guy who practiced for 6 years on how to make the egg custard sushi every day. I can absolutely say he perfected it. Price150 dollars/per person for sushi bar experience and 120 for dining room experience. Sake pairing an additional 45 dollars. For those who want the full experience - expect to drop AT LEAST 600 for two people including tip/tax/alcohol.",34,0.9915
477,16,7,5.0,"Having never done one of these escape rooms I sort of had pre-conceived notions; a mix of the movie Saw and a cheesy office room space with a few locks to open.. well that wasn't the case here. From the very beginning when you enter the first door to the ""Maze of Hakaina""to get the backstory you are immersed in their world. The basic jist is that you are to enter a Japanese maze to both escape and rescue a boy who got lost in it. Along the way you encounter demons and must solve clues to get from the starting point until the very end (through various rooms). I enjoyed the dim lighting and that the clues were very creative, and went beyond what you may have initially thought. Being in a group of 4 was nice as we worked together and different people pieced together different riddles/clues. I did enjoy the hints that were given, they were good at putting you on the right track. The space itself was very well put together with impressive Japanese artifacts and letters decorating the walls and some very fun props that totally fit the mood. We completed the missions with 30 seconds to spare! Afterward, I enjoyed speaking with the staff on our opinions on what to improve and what we liked, but from my friends who had been to make quest rooms like this, they said this was amongst their favorite. This would be a great team-building activity, fun for a group of friends, or anyone that wants to escape from their phones and reality for 1 hr to get caught up in an adventure. I would surely try some of their other room experiences around NYC.",14,0.9955
478,12,17,5.0,"I confess that a part of me doesn't really want to write this review, because a slightly empty rooftop bar at 8 pm on a Thursday is the equivalent of a $1500 one-bedroom Manhattan apartment or $1 avocados - rare unicorns that must be protected against all disclosure. Skylark has ridiculous views, especially if you can make a reservation and score a table. I love how they turn down the music to just the right level so you don't need to shriek like a banshee in order to have a normal conversation with your friends. I love how the rooftop area isn't ridiculously crowded (in no part because it's still relatively unknown). I love how they were patient enough with the frequent changes in my reservation, and how they kept my table even when my party was 20 minutes late.The food and drinks are pricey but you're definitely paying for the views and the opportunity to lounge on a comfy couch while enjoying said views. From one side, you have an unblocked view of the Hudson. The prickly pear margarita is a godsend on humid August nights. As for food, we tried the $20 Skylark sliders (not worth it IMO for only three sliders), the Peking duck wontons (this was definitely worth it), the guacamole, and the burrata pizzette.For rooftop bars in general, I think it's better to get a dinner beforehand and just come for drinks.

The seats are upholstered with red duct tape, there is limited seating, the entire place smells like spilled beer, and the service isn't exactly lavish. The nice thing about Rudy's is that it doesn't pretend to be something it's not. It is unapologetically dirty and crowded, but the drinks are dirt cheap, the vibe is friendly, and you get a free hot dog with every drink. Favorites include the house blonde ale (only $8 for a whole pitcher) and the ""beer and a shot"" deals (there are a few, including one called the ""Mexican hat dance""- for only $5). They have some good beers in bottles and in drafts, too, including the Lagunitas IPA (one of my favorite beers) for a mere $5. You have to ask for the hot dog, but make no mistake- they're totally free. And while they weren't exactly gourmet, they hit the spot and were great with a beer. I've been wanting to check this place out for a long time, and it did not disappoint. Oh, tip: they have a back door to Rudy's ""back yard"" that allows you to drink your cheap beers in a more open, outdoor location. Really nice during the warm months.",23,0.9876

My friend and I got there around 8ish on a Tuesday night. There was security outside that was asking if we had a reservation. Kind of bizarre because I thought that was something I would speak with the hostess stand regarding. Anywho we opted to sit at the bar area v.s a table because that is what we prefer. The bar set up contains about 6-8 seats and it is kind of an awkward set up due to half of the bar facing part of the open kitchen and shelving blocking your view, and then the other half of the bar you view is obstructed by large jars of sangria. I believe it is more of a service bar if anything...so don't expect to really know your bartender. I will say the good thing about sitting next to an open kitchen is seeing and watching the food being prepared.For drinks we started off with the Roja Sangria in a carafe which was about $34 and we each got about 2 full glasses out of it. What I loved and appreciated about the Sangria carafe is they did not put ice in the carafe and only in your glass. I hate when I order a carafe from other places and the ice waters down the drink. Smart on your part Ricardo's Steakhouse...well played! Since we were sitting next to the kitchen we got to see ALOT of dishes prepared. At Ricardo's you can really tell not only the servers BUT ALSO the kitchen takes pride in their work. The presentation or plating of the food is out of this world!After drooling over all of the food I decided to get the Shrimp Alfredo penne pasta. Shrimp Alfredo is such a simple dish you can find at any restaurant BUT HONEY THEY KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK! It was well seasoned and the sauce was not thin, but thicker and creamy. I loved every minute of the entree! You ever eat food and get to the last bite and instantly become sad? That happen with me last night. My friend ordered Salmon Al Vodka pasta and she said it would be worth commuting from Brooklyn to Harlem for again.As far as the ambiance it was pretty rockin on a Tuesday evening. Their playlist is awesome from Biggie to Mint Condition to Solange! I think there were 5 people there celebrating their birthday, and each time they would bring out a cake with sparklers on it to some hip hop birthday inspired song ( Rihanna ""Cake"", Trey Songz ""Say Ahh"", or 2 Chainz ""Birthday Song"").

Not Han!I discovered Han Sushi one day on Seamless when I accidentally searched for sushi instead of using their cuisine type feature. Pricing was extremely reasonable, reviews were great, and I hadn't tried it before. Why not? I placed an order. Estimated wait time was 40 minutes or so. Not 20 minutes later, my doorbell rings. That can't be the sushi, right? WRONG. The delivery man RUNS up four flights of stairs to my apartment and hands me the bag. What?Not only that, but the food was outstanding as far as delivery goes. ""This must be a fluke"" I tell myself as I stuff my face with a tuna roll. ""This was a one time thing"".I now have ordered from this place 30+ times and only ONCE did anything deviate from the exact situation described above (sushi guy running up the stairs and all- that guys is awesome and you will love him). One time, my food was late. And by late I mean MAYBE 15 minutes late. I am not exaggerating, the delivery man apologized to me three times.

Good Cantonese food in Chinatown is becoming more and more of a relic in recent years, but Wu's remain one of the best that the Manhattan has to offer. Solid selection of noodle soups, rice plates, stir-fried dishes, and dim sum will forever allow this spot to be a popular fixture for locals.

Grumpy is no exception... and other than the logo, no one here is actually, well, grumpy. If you work in midtown, the café is a respite from your office, and from the noisy streets of Times Square and Herald Square surrounding it. Grumpy truly serves a fantastic espresso - I usually get a soy latte (and yes, they've got almond milk, too). Though, keep in mind ICED lattes are 50 cents extra. They roast their own beans and every cup packs a punch. I come here on a regular basis, and personally speaking, of Grumpy's seven locations, this one has the best energy and overall fun baristas. Grumpy also has many carb-heavy pastries. And, as it is with many of their cafés, this Grumpy is laptop-free.

We weren't really sure what the wait would be like, so we decided to get there around 8, since we assumed there would be some sort of a wait, and we could just put our names down and grab a drink out front at the Garrett. So we showed up about ten to 8:00 and were actually seated right away. The place is pretty small. There's one long communal table, maybe 2 or 3 two-top tables, and then some seating at the bar which faces the open kitchen where you can see them cooking. The place wasn't too crowded at 8:00, but as the night went on the place filled up. Our waiter came over to ask about our water preference, and explaind the menu a bit. It was mostly smaller plates, with a few big ones. He suggested we get two little plates, two big plates, and share everything. We browsed through the menu, and decided to get the lasagna bolo for two as our main to share, the short rib tartare, and the shrimp crudo dish. I am generally not a fan of meat that is tartare or carpaccio (aka raw) but my friend wanted to try the short rib tartare, so I thought I'd give it a try. No regrets! It was really good. It was 4 crackers/toasts with a generous portion of the short rib on top. It says there was horseradish in it, but the taste was not that strong, which I liked. The shrimp crudo was also really good, a nice refreshing dish. Then the lasagna bolo came out, which was amazing! It was so cute; it came out in a dish with about 5 rolled up lasagnas, and plenty of ricotta cheese. Seriously, so good! After all that food we were stuffed, and couldn't possibly eat dessert. Overall everything was great! The food was top notch, as well as the service. I will say the drink selection compared to the bar it's attached to was slim, but I went with a glass of Rose so that wasn't an issue for me. Since the menu isn't huge, I might wait a bit for them to change it up, but I would definitely go back!",22,0.9925

It's so crowded it detracts from amazing drinks and excellent service from the bartenders.At our most recent trip, the bouncer made small talk with us as he was checking our IDs. Prolly cuz Pete and I are old AF and he didn't have to look that hard. He lead us to a MUCH different room upstairs - not at all crowded, classy seating, same great drinks and gracious bartenders. The drinks here are $16 each which is more than I spend on most whole bottles of wine. I don't care. Get a delicious drink here. It is so worth it. My drink had like 90 ingredients including Aperol. The bartender gave us complimentary sparkling water, which was a nice touch.The bill came to more than what we had recently spent on dinner and it was worth every cent.

491,20,13,5.0,"Oh my god. For every dessert person, this place is the definition of heaven. I saw the high rating and was a bit skeptical because although the taste, texture and everything about this dessert was amazing; it is not the most photogenic and looks very average. But I can tell you for sure, the making of this dessert and everything about the ingredients taste very very refined. This is an art, and to make the merveilleux looks extremely difficult even for the best of pastry chefs. I got the chocolate one, ate it in the corner and came back to try the coffee one as well after 5 minutes. It is just absolutely amazingly light, crumbles in the right way and sweet enough to melt anyones troubles away. The chocolate tastes alike to the quality of the best chocolatiers and meringue just shattered in the most fragile way. I also got the chocolate chip brioche, which was a miracle in itself. The star of the show was the meringue but the brioche was also amazingly fluffy and buttery and the chocolate was amazing. Tasted fresh out of the oven. One of the best bakeries to check out in the city. This is after having been to the most hyped up places and I can tell you for sure, this is one of the most impressive dessert shops I have had the pleasure of frequenting in the city. I would give them more than 5 stars if I could. Not even speaking of the great service as the cashier who worked there threw in an extra mini brioche bc she saw how I was eyeing the pastries. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here and can rave about this place for ages if needed. Amazing experience",22,0.9953
492,26,18,5.0,"I'm so happy there's a cat cafe in New York. It basically saves me a trip to Japan. Except, in Japan those cat cafes don't charge hourly but alas the money is going to a good cause. I came in late afternoon on Tuesday and this place was empty. Great for me because that means all the cats are mine. When you walk in they tell you it's $6 per half hour (a dollar more than when they opened), you pay at the end, and they warned me when my half hour was almost done (although, I don't think they warn you normally. So, keep a watch on your clock). You then sign a waiver, take off your shoes, sanitize, and play with all the cats you desire. You can also order drinks and snacks and the people will deliver it to you. They provide you toys that you can use to play with the cats and an array of seats and tables you can sit at to watch all the cats you want. I was reading some of the other reviews and one of the reasons why people wouldn't rate it so low is because the cats are asleep and not as enthusiastic when they see people. I wonder why that is. Oh, it's because they're cats. Not dogs. Cat's have all different personalities some can be very trusting and loving and others need time to warm up to you. So, you might need some patience but the workers there are knowledgeable to tell you which cats are more willing to play with you, which cats you can pick up, and which cats are more of a lone wolf. They know each cat and the story of how they got to the shelter and they're all up for a forever home! This is an amazing place and I'm going to bring all my friends here who need a furry little friend! I mean who wouldn't benefit from a cat in their life?",32,0.9874
493,23,10,5.0,"Super excited to write this review and post pictures! Located in Seaport, this ipic theater took over the old market place where Gap used to be. This is by far the best theater I've been to. The closest experience I've ever had is with AMC dine in theater and that doesn't really compare with this one. Of course here, I'm paying $29 pp and kind of expect this to be better than AMCs dine in. Reserved seatings here as well so you don't need to rush to get good seats. You walk in and what's great about this is the ticket kiosk. Sure they now have these in different theaters, but their machine looked really new and fancy. Not only does it print out your ticket, but if you purchased the premium + seats (waiter, reclining seats, unlimited popcorn), the kiosk will print out a ""complimentary popcorn"" ticket which means unlimited popcorn. If you bought the premium + seats, they automatically bring you popcorn anyways so technically you don't need that popcorn ticket. Going up the escalators: Wow, such pretty designs and artwork. The theater corridor was so pretty and there were waiters standing in front of each theater room professionally waiting to serve customers. Now we are in the theater: A couples pod with 2 seats that recline. You get a pillow and blankie :) very awesome since we all know theaters can get chilly...way to cozy up. Only thing is that the arm rest in between the 2 seats do not go up so fellas, there's no snuggling up with the gals :P You have a cup holder next to the seats, a swiveling table to share. All of these things mentioned are the premium + seats. The waiter service that comes with these seats were great. They were friendly, pretty quick with responsiveness when you hit the service light, and efficient. No complaints here. 2 minor things: I wish they had utensils, but most of the food items on the menu were finger foods and I wish they didn't run out of certain foods on the menu because I wanted to try everything. Food was really good even though most were finger foods. The sauces that came with the items were really good and unique (pictures posted). All the orange seats are the premium + seats. There is one row of orange seats in front of the pods that are also premium + where a larger group can all sit together. Only difference between that and the pods is that the row has no cup holders, but whatever. The tan seats are all the way up front, called premium seats. They are cheaper of course because the chairs don't recline, there's no waiter, no popcorn, no pillow, no blankie and of course, too close to the screen so basically aren't really worth sitting at to be honest. If I had to choose those seats, I'd rather do a regular theater. If you are going to come to ipic, then go hard or go home lol. Dont be cheapy cheapy lol. After the movie or even before, go upstairs to the bar on the 3rd floor (also where bathrooms are located). This theater is the perfect place to bring a date. Eat dinner while watching a movie, then head upstairs for drinks right after. Overall, I would definitely come back to enjoy a great big popular film, but wouldn't do this for every movie. It was a wonderful experience and hopefully it wouldn't be too hard to get tickets in the future.",39,0.9987

496,24,19,5.0,"I am a SUCKER for that little ""hot and new"" symbol on Yelp... that's how I ended up at Thai Villa. Was having drinks with real-life friend and fellow Yelper Desi M. at Wined Up when we decided to come here for food.I called ahead to secure a table, and we were seated right away. The place was bustling, and it felt a little like walking into a sexy thai lair, with gold leaves dangling from the ceiling and cozy harem-like booths lining the walls.We both had glasses of wine. The chef was sending out an amuse bouche to all tables - Ma Hor, a little pineapple segment with a thai meatball on top. It was sweet and savory and soft and firm and a nice introduction to the meal and to the restaurant. We also got complimentary taro chips, which helped take the spicy edge off of some of the food later! The menu is cool, opening from the middle with three sections. Despite the cool look, I was unfortunately unclear on what each of the sections meant. There is ""Preferred, Signature, and Classic."" I was clear that Classic is ""regular shit for your stupid American palates"" but not on the difference between Preferred and Signature. Is one better? I want to order from the better one! Our server (Lin?) was super cute and friendly. We started off with the chicken in pandan leaves. I don't know what that is, but I know it means the chicken was SUPER moist and yummy from being cooked while all wrapped up. We also had the spicy chicken wings, solid. For our entree, we shared the Kaeng Run Juan, which our server recommended. It was spicy and lemongrassy and perfect. We did not have room for dessert, and after dinner plus happy hour, I was drunk off my ass. But I HIGHLY recommend Thai Villa and look forward to returning soon!",28,0.9956
497,15,8,5.0,"I was absolutely blown away by the level of service here. Sat at the bar for Happy Hour, which runs from 5-7, and had a great experience with both drinks and service.What drew us here was the attractively priced Happy Hour, but I'd definitely return to try the food. Plates kept passing us that looked and smelled amazing, and the fare goes well beyond your typical offerings. Yucca dishes, feijoada, shrimp...they really have a great variety.CAIPIRINHAS ($7 on HH):We came for the $7 caipirinhas and did not leave disappointed. Caipirinhas are hard to come by in general, let alone on happy hour menus, and that made Samba stand out among all the other HH's in Hell's Kitchen. For the uninitiated (and believe me, you want to be initiated), these simple drinks are made with cachaca (Brazilian sugarcane rum), sugar, and lime. Think of them as a more intense variant on mojitos. Samba offers their caipirinhas in a couple different flavors: currently they have coconut, passion fruit, strawberry, and lime. I can't recommend the coconut one highly enough. If you're a fan of creamy drinks, this one's for you. They use coconut milk rather than just flavoring it with a coconut syrup, and this gives it a fantastic consistency and rich taste.Last but not least, I have to sing the praises of the husband-wife duo that run Samba and man the bar. Not only are they genuinely sweet, but they're highly skilled and provide excellent service. They truly make guests feel at home. Bertha was wonderful to speak with as we sat at the bar for almost 2 hours. When we were curious about a couple drinks (the passion fruit caipirinha and cashew juice), she even offered us samples! Just wonderful, wonderful service, the kind that certainly does not go unnoticed and will bring them many loyal customers. Overall, I'm so happy you're in the neighborhood Samba! Can't wait to be back.",23,0.9988
498,17,11,5.0,"Love this Japanese izakaya spot. Located on top of Nitecap, this place can easily come across as a speakeasy where the entrance looks like an entrance to an apartment building. You need to buzz in to enter the restaurant. The space is dim and very cozy with meditative music (Japanese style) playing in the background. The food was excellent, however quite small in portion. Our server was very professional and attentive. We stayed past closing and he didn't even say anything nor tried to kick us out. Would definitely come back again. Spicy Cod Roe - they shaped it to look like sausages. It tasted like sausage too.Ika no Uni Ae (Squid sashimi mixed with uni) - So creamy and yummy with rich uni flavor. Absolutely love this dish. Uni sashimi - Only 3-4 pieces but the flavor is just right. Love it!!Kinoko Toban Yaki - Warm and yummy. Love the texture and flavor. Uni over rice cake - I'm not a rice cake fan so it was okay. Mackerel sashimi - By far the best Mackerel I ever had. The pieces are so tiny but the flavor and texture are so good. Saki pudding - There's a few gold flakes on it but love the flavor...it goes from the bitterness of the saki to the sweetness of the pudding.Almond pudding - I really like the creaminess of the almond milk on the pudding. You eat it by putting the pudding on your dish and pour the creamy almond milk over it and add the strawberriesP.S.: Some seats have a large cabinet where you can store your stuff while dinning in.

500,28,16,5.0,If you are into ramen then Mososan is your Mecca. The broth is on the thicker and soupier side than your typical ramen joint. Thicker in this case translates into more flavor. Momosan's high-point is that their noodles maintain their texture and do not become soggy. Apparently--and per the educational menu--there's a term for this but I don't remember what is that term. Best gyozas ever! I typically burn the roof of my mouth because I don't have the patience to wait for the gyozas to cool down once they arrive (served in a rectangular sizzling-hot cast-iron plate). Staff is great!. What sucks about Momosan are the long queues. If it weren't for the wait Momoson would be elevated to ramen Utopia from ramen Mecca.

When I found out it would be tapas and cocktails that excitement went to the power of ^10 and I could barely contain myself.Fast forward a couple months since their debut, and I am totally smitten with this small eatery in the heart of WaHi.

503,26,12,5.0,"So I've done Kamayan here 4x and the rest of my visits were for the usual menu. I'll split my review between the two.Kamayan:   Kamayan is done on Wednesday and Thursday nights for parties of 4 or more, for $55/pp, and on any other night for parties of 10 or more, for $65/pp. The prices include tax and tip, but not drinks. On my most recent Kamayan it was $92/pp on a Sunday for 13 ppl with everyone having one drink each. Kamayan reservations are ONLY done through email. Whoever is doing the organizing will be the one who emails them with the information of date, time, and number of people in the party. From there they will email you back with their availability, if it is the exact time or very close to it, then they will also email you the information on pre-ordering your dinner. They usually allow a good 24hrs to get it all in order, as you also must place a credit card in. So if you're the one coordinating the dinner, then it is best that you know of any dietary restrictions ahead of time. When most of the party arrives, they usually start setting up the table at this point, and will be one of the longest 20-30mins ever since you can smell and sometimes see all the amazing food being set up, but you can't touch it yet. The table will be fully set up with all the hot food you pre-ordered, DON'T FORGET TO TAKE PICTURES at this point, if you want them. Once everyone is seated the servers will come around with wet towels to wipe your hands with, and to keep so that you may use them to wipe your fingers with throughout the dinner. The servers will also gladly do a demo for you on the correct way to eat, and if you aren't sure, maybe checkout YouTube or ask a fellow Filipino friend to show you =P. Just remember to, one, clean your nails as well, so if you have cracked polish or etc, then it is best to ""take care"" of all that before coming to the Kamayan; and two, your fingers should never touch your lips/go in your mouth/be licked. The food is ALL being shared, so be courteous and try not to put your saliva everywhere. After everyone is done with the hot food they will pass out to-go containers for anyone who wants to take home any leftover food there may be. Then they give out halo-halo for dessert. The dinner itself is quite expensive just taking into consideration the amount of food you are getting and etc, however what you are also paying for is the experience, and this is why I've done Kamayan so many times.Usual Menu:   Jeepney has a nice backyard area where you can also enjoy your meal, and feels great on those cool Fall days/nights. We usually prefer to sit in the back if trying to have a good conversation amongst the group as it can get really loud inside. The bar is very lively, and not much elbow room if trying to have a meal. Their usual menu is filled with delicious Filipino dishes and nothing has yet to disappoint. The restaurant is actually quite small, so be prepared for a wait if you do not have reservations.The only downside I can think of is the fact that they aren't open late so I can get a -silog fix after a late night of being out/drinking.

The focus seems to be more on take-out and delivery, but the quirky atmosphere and eclectic music (from xylophone music to jazz), is not to be missed. We came here around 7pm on a Thursday, and were seated immediately. The menu is simple--choose a main, a sauce, and two sides. The actual food presented on adorable partitioned plates, though, is anything but simple. Everything is well-executed and I'm hoping to come back soon to try more combinations. You can also opt to order as many of the sides a la carte, if you'd like. Mains: - Rotisserie chicken: I opted for the Romesco sauce to complement this crispy-on-the-outside-but-insanely-juicy-on-the-inside main. No part was dry, and the nutty-sweet sauce added another dimension and some necessary texture. I was surprised with how many pieces of chicken were on my plate, and loved that one of the chicken bones had a paper handle.  - Swedish meatballs: These already come with a creamy, thin gravy, so there was no need to order extra sauce. The meatballs were already flavorful on their own, with sweet browned bits and a juicy center. Seven meatballs came on a plate.Sides:  - Soup: The soup was one of the best gazpachos I've ever had. There was a hint of rose, and a hint of mint which resulted in a refreshing, developed soup that never once bored my taste buds. It wasn't as strained as I would have liked, but the flavor was on-point.  - Pasta: Ricotta gnocchi with crème fraîche. No complaints here given the combination.   - Pickled beets: These came with herbed goat cheese and candied walnuts. Solid.  - Pattypan squash parm: First of all, I learned about a new squash variety. Second of all, the size and shape made it perfect for a small parm side. Warm and homey. We had the root beer float for dessert because we are children. - - -Likelihood of another visit:Very likely. I hope it doesn't get too popular too soon!",25,0.9921

Nothing like this upper east with a 70's inspired theme, movies playing and a funky disco type ball and lights creatively lighting up the back area of the bar and small dance floor. A downtown type bar brought uptown.The owners' objective was to make a fun neighborhood feeling bar, where everyone feels welcome: that they've done with their fantastic, friendly service and incredibly rad red 70's theme and decor. The layout is great: Tables along the side and a long amazingly decorated bar are great for sitting and having conversation, disco type dance area in back, and (a little later in the night) entertainers dancing in the front bar area. Also tables outside if you're more into people watching.They are developing a lineup of entertainment many days of the week including dancers some nights, comedians one night a week, and a gay inspired night Mondays. Two Gogo dancers came on around 9 dancing in two designated spots one visible from an open window facing 2nd avenue as passers by snapped photos - entertaining without being over the top or distracting since they stayed in one spot. The managers really are impressively passionate and excited about Ethyl's: friendly, present, so eager to talk about the thought that went into the decor and bringing this downtown type spot uptown. Adam in particular was extremely enthusiastic and even dances thru the bar while mingling and checking in on customers. I had a Hotpants Punch off the menu - very good and I'm eager to try the Mezcel drink they're putting on the menu.They also have a solid food menu with a born and raised New Yorker Chef (Paul Gerard) who has anImpressive list of experience and drove much of the concept of Ethyl's and its 70's based theme and decor .

515,34,24,5.0,"Using up characters by saying I'm going to run out of characters. The eternal struggle. That's the only negativity you'll hear from me in this review, though. Yerba Buena has been on my list for ages before I finally dined here on Thursday night. So my expectations were very high. Usually that doesn't work out so well for me, but not the case here. The cocktails were superb, the food was even better, and the service was on another level. This place is all kinds of fabulous.YB is located in one of the hotter areas of the city--straddles the LES and the East Village in the most platonic way. A friend and I made reservations because the space itself, though lovely, is pretty small. Though the place was filled with parties of friends on this particular night, I'd say it's just as viable for a date spot--especially if you decide to dine tapas-style. Despite YB being a smaller restaurant, they happily accommodate larger groups. We were very surprised to find a group of maybe 12 guys celebrating someone's birthday. Surprising, because how many guys do you know that can successfully rally ALL of the troops for a birthday dinner at a fun restaurant? Maybe I'm ignorant, but my friend was just as intrigued as I was. Anyway.Though the prices at YB are pretty typical for Spanish spots, the hospitality and decor here are that of a much nicer restaurant. Everything is beautifully polished and refined, which was a pleasant surprise. Being the twentysomethings that we are, we were totally floored when several members of the waitstaff promptly offered to remove our jackets as we sat down. Not mad at it. As it turns out, we got double the love, because we had to switch tables soon after getting settled at our table. The host told us that he needed our space for a party of four but that he'd seat us in a booth right away. As we swapped, he told us that we shouldn't worry, for he'd personally take care of us for the rest of the night. And this didn't seem forced or overkill or anything like that. The dude was just all kinds of classy. When words like ""decorum"" and ""etiquette"" are thrown around, well, this was that.Onto the drinks. I had the Poquito Picante (gin + jalapeño + cilantro + cucumber + combier + fresh lemon juice) and the Desert Rose (rose infused gin + prickly pear purée + lemon juice). The Poquito Picante, though not as aesthetically pleasing as the Desert Rose, is my ideal cocktail. If you've read my other cocktail reviews, you know that spicy cocktails are my jam (do people still say that?). This drink is thoughtful, creative, well-balanced and supremely satisfying. It's apparently their most popular drink, which doesn't surprise me one bit (sorry, I think I've used that word a lot in this review). The Desert Rose pretty much tastes like you're drinking a posh English garden, minus the dirt. It's not bad, but I'd pass on it if I got a do-over. Still appreciate the creativity though.Our food damage was as follows:Hojas de Salmon (black truffle vinaigrette, quinoa, green onion-jalapeño salsa, yuzu): AThe black truffle vinaigrette sold us. This was the perfect dish to start off our meal. Light but plenty flavorful, texturally interesting and more conducive to sharing than some of the over options. Chicharron de Calamar (blue corn meal-crusted calamari, sweet plantains, tamarind vinaigrette): A+I don't order calamari when I'm out unless there's some kind of twist. In my opinion, there's always something more interesting to order. Whoever decided to experiment with ways to bread calamari hit the jackpot with this one. The blue corn meal added fantastic flavor and texture which made for one of the best calamari dishes I've ever had. Both the calamari and the plantains are dressed in equally tasty tamarind vinaigrette. For those wary about trying ceviche but are craving seafood, this is your baby.Brisket tacos (chipotle braised brisket, corn tortillas, avocado, chipotle salsa): A+What could be bad? Look at the ingredients and it's pretty damn obvious how drool-worthy these babies are. Sure, it's not the most creative dish on the menu, but who needs creative when you have perfectly-braised brisket, avo AND all the chipotle. Come on friends, make the right move.Toro Taquitos (tuna tartar, peanut butter aioli, chile de arbol, cilantro chimichurri): A+For whatever reason, I didn't expect these to come in ""taco"" form, despite the name. If you're hesitant to order to ceviche dishes, this is nothing like any ceviche you've have before. You get three thin, crispy tacos filled with all the fixin's here. They pair peanut butter and tuna in two dishes here, a venture I'm in full support of. Somehow it works. These are fresh, rich, herbaceous and satisfying. Seriously yum.$100 bill. Standard for tapas in NYC.As we were in the process of paying, the host approached us with two champagne flutes and poured us each a glass for a complimentary toast.""I told you I'd take care of you,"" he said.

517,46,32,5.0,"Rory's. I have been going to Rory Dolan's way before my Yelping days existed. Located on McLean Ave., this traditional Irish pub has been around since 1994 and boasts an inviting exterior that slightly resembles a castle with just as an inviting interior. The venue is large and well laidout, and like most Irish pubs I've encountered they have beautiful Waterford Crystals displayed in lit, glassed in wood armoires throughout, which aides in the homey, warm atmosphere. Upon entering, the first thing you see is a large rectangular bar, surrounded by plenty of booths, a few high-top tables, plus a raised dining area towards the back of the restaurant. There are also well placed flat screen tv's and projection screens spread throughout the restaurant to catch all the events of the day plus your local games. Aside from their well stocked bar, like most pubs, food offerings are available through a diverse menu covering all Irish, American and Italian-American food staples. In my opinion, Rory's food is not overwhelmingly the best, but you can't go wrong with a burger, salad, or some type of veggie+protein+carb entree to satiate and soak up your adult beverage. Rory's has hostessed many a good time of birthday parties, opportunites of meeting new people, mingled and jigged at many St. Patty's Days parties. Plus there's also the obligatory Friday night move all the dinner tables towards the back of the restaurant and set-up the DJ for that evenings dance party leading to many, upon many good times. -Very friendly and welcoming service-Outdoor sidewalk seating available -Party Room for special occasions-Metered street and Valet parking available-Happy Hour on Friday's; 4:00pm-6:00pm only-DJ on Friday and Saturday nightsCome into Rory Dolan's solo or with a crew, you are bound to find most of what you need and have a good time.",47,0.9943
518,28,15,5.0,"I was hooked from the moment I tasted some of their Poké on the Yelp cruise this year. On that faithful night, I vowed to try them in person and took the task serious enough as to challenge a fellow Yelper to see who would try them first. I won. Go fig. Sorry G. G.!! #sorrynotsorry  First thing's first, know what you want. Walking in here was more intimidating than that of facing the curving line of Chipotle customers, leering at you while you find you way to the end of the line. You're super uncomfortably close to fellow patrons and you're pretty much yelling out your order over people's heads. So upon entering, either have the menu pulled up on your phone or grab one from the cashier counter or you'll be the bain of everyone's existence with a large helping of continuous side eye from those who can tell you're a nube a mile away. Not to mention that it seemed as though the closer they got to closing, the more people filed in. It took almost thirty minutes to get my food and it was most certainly worth it. I'm one who eats for the love of taste and food so while that doesn't help my waistline, I am most happy, trying various items as opposed to have a set of courses. I love tapas restaurants and places where you're able to ""build your own"" menu item. It's a semi-adult way to play with your food and allows for a taste of as much or as little as you'd like. So while they offer their ""Signature Works"" items, I went with the Poké Your Way (build your own).You have a choice of the bowl, the ""burrito"" which is really just a burrito-sized Maki roll or the salad. After you pick which item you want, you pick your proteins. Some are raw like the salmon and tuna but they also have items prepared sous vide, which is basically sealing a seasoned protein in an airtight plastic bag and slow cooking in a temperature-regulated water bath. They prep the chicken, scallops and shrimp sous vide. Organic tofu is the vegan op. I ordered a Poké Bowl w/Quinoa, Ahi and Salmon.Next, you choose your mix-ins. They offer a couple types of seaweed, cucumber slices and even diced mango but I went with the edamame, cilantro and shiso leaves. For the flavor option, you're supposed to only choose one but being me, I asked for the sriracha aioli AND the spicy ginger and I'm glad I did. They also have the fresh, citrus-y ponzu, sweet chili gochu, wasabi aioli and a few others. The last two options are for adding additional toppings and some crunch for texture. I asked for avocado on the side since it was take out and had them add some pickled ginger as well as masago, with which they were generous. They also have other toppings including furikake, crab salad and wasabi. For crunch, I went simple with some sesame seeds but you can get crazy with macadamia nuts, onion crisps and then some.The miso soup was good for the price. They fill up your cup with seaweed, scallion and tofu and you fill the cup, yourself, from the miso soup dispenser on the counter! I love miso. The price isn't too bad considering a lot of the items are included. It's just a matter of how many you want to order. They're a little skimpy on the protein servings but again, you can offset that by ordering a crapload of add-ins to get your money's worth. The fish is super fresh and I could seriously live on this forever.",28,0.9952

I came here for a roommate dinner and it was the perfect set up for catching up with friends. The wait staff was super friendly, very attentive in refilling our water and ensuring we were having a good time. They have wine and beer which was exactly what we were looking for. As for the food, it was delicious.My roommate and I started with the pizza bread and meatball trio. Both were hits for me. I would go back just to eat the appetizers. The pizza bread was so good and huge in portions. Six thick cut pieces of heaven. The bread was crisp and crunchy on the outside but super fluffy, airy and soft on the inside. It was strong to hold the tomato sauce and melted mozzarella well. Add some parmesan cheese and red hot chili flakes and it became glorious. Loved every bite. The meatball trio were three large balls of awesome meat. The meat itself was seasoned very well and the tomato sauce was creamy with great hits of basil and olive oil. Both were plenty to share between two people. I was already kind of full by the time the pasta came but of course I devoured that as well. We shared the Spaghetti and white clam sauce and again, another top notch dish. There was plenty to share between two people. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente and the white wine sauce was seasoned beautifully and tasted almost buttery with the spaghetti. There were also plenty of clams in the dish. Like a delicious surplus of it which is great because it balanced well with the pasta and made every bite worth it.Overall, a delicious meal.

It was one of the first nice days we had in New York this year so we decided to sit outside. The garden is very cute. It is closed off and surrounded by a bunch of flowers and herbs. We ordered two drinks to start. The volver ($14) which is tequila based with mezcal, green chartreuse, lime, ginger, agave, basil, and grapefruit bitters. It was good but I liked the duchess ($14) better which had gin, plum, early grey tea, blackberries, lemon, and agave. Luckily my boyfriend liked the tequila one better so we switched. To start we shared the burrata $16 which was so good. You really can't go wrong with cheese. We also got the roasted golden beets which were good but I wouldn't order it again. For the main courses they had two fish entrees and we got both. Mine was a red snapper $29 with green peas, fiddlehead ferns, and morels. It was super delicious but a little on the well done side. Next time I would specify on how I want it. I really enjoyed the other fish as well I just can't remember what it is. Regardless, the fish options change but I would highly recommend them as both were great. Our waitress was also helpful when we ordered wine and the service was great.

This seriously happened to me after dining at Blue Hill. I'm not kidding. It was one of the most amazing culinary experiences I have had. To date, there is no other restaurant, food, or service that I find to be even somewhat comparable.I probably cannot add much more to what has already been said. But I'll provide a few bits of info that were specific to me.The service was amazing from beginning to end. I dined alone and opted to eat at a table, instead of at the bar. I chose the daily menu. I discussed my preferences with the server, along with some dietary restrictions that were making it difficult for me to choose one option from each course. She said that she would speak with the chef about other options we could do. I was hesitant because I did not want to modify the beauty and flavors already created by the chef for each serving. But the server assured me that they want me to have a great experience and that they are very happy to accommodate almost any dietary restriction or request.The chef then suggested two items from the first course (in lieu of one from the second course as I could not eat anything from the second course). The chef also swapped out some of the items I could not eat with items that I could. I cannot possibly explain the food nirvana as I bit in each and every piece of the meal. I felt like I was in a culinary utopia, with the most creative, fresh, and delicious vegetables and food ever.They also created a dessert for me which was gluten free, as the standard dessert had gluten. My dessert was teeny, tiny cubes of cantaloupe on a bed of Stone Barns honey and with some ginger. They also brought out halves of various seasonal plums on the same honey. I really cannot adequately describe how beautiful it is to taste fresh fruits and vegetables that are prepared in a loving way to bring out the best in each.In addition to the food, the patrons are truly very cool. I was lucky enough to have a couple sit to my left that have been coming to the restaurant every single week since it opened in 2000! That is dedication - and after having my first experience at Blue Hill, I can only say I envy them for being able to do so financially. They were both lovely and I enjoyed hearing their experiences as being long-time diners. On my right, a beautiful mother and son arrived during my dessert course and we started chatting almost immediately. The clientele probably clearly reflects Dan Barber's philosophy of farm-to-table, as the diners all seemed to have their feet planted firmly in the ground, but aware of all the beauty going on around them and sharing it with those nearby.I will try to make this a regular spot for me as they change their menu regularly with the season.",26,0.9924

I'm a HUGE uni lover so Soto to me is Michael phelps's champion defense to 200m butterfly in Rio. It is supposed to be that good and it even breaks my record for best Omakase. I just can't think of why the average Yelp review is 3.5 for this amazing place. To me, it surely deserves the two Michelin stars if not more!Without hesitation, my friend and I went with Omakase (Omakase means ""I'll leave it to you"" in Japanese. Used in Japanese cuisines, simply means tasting menu that you leave the chef to decide what to present in the whole course with creativity). Omakase includes 12 dishes + 13 pieces of sushi + Mochi ice cream in assorted flavors. We also informed our waitress that we are both big uni lovers so they slightly customized the menu for us. The first half of the meal was full of wonders leaving us wordless to describe it. The uni presented in different dishes taste so divinely uni-y! The texture is creamy, silk-like smooth, a bit custard-like and wet. Upon biting it, the luxurious, nutty, and sweet taste bursts on my palate! Uni is also presented is fine delicate differences in each dish - fatter, creamier and nuttier in uni cocktail, more custard-like and stronger in the botan Ebi tar tare, creamier and sweeter in the uni/quail egg/squid dish. While uni dishes are mind-blowing, other non-sushi dishes were also outstanding. (Basically I loved everything I had there!) 1) The white and black tofu is the most soft and creamiest I have ever had not to mention the heavenly good sesame aroma. 2) Tuna tartar is OMG-good - soft and smooth like tofu, with the creamy layer of avocado and refreshing note from the scallions. 3) I'm not huge fan of tempera, but the scallop tempera is simply excellent - flavor well presented and not heavy at all!The second half - sushi part was no less amazing than the first part. The most memorable one to me is the sea scallop (5+/5) - absolutely delicious! It's so sweet and succulent with a touch of refreshing sourness from the ponzu sauce. While the sweet shrimp didn't deliver the succulence and sweetness I was looking for.The meal ended with 5 home-made Mochi ice cream balls. The skin is thick, soft and chewy and the taste is very natural!My highest recommendation. Bring your special ones here to cherish the love towards amazing japanese food together - life is perfect. For ppl less fond of uni - inform the waitress when ordering. Only negative I could think of is that it is louder than an average sushi bar. Our waitress was very efficient and attentive.

People leaving saying they'll come back later. Ha! By afternoon it is really crazy. I was helped promptly this am and found my spot at the counter. I inhaled the Peanut Butter and Jelly Cupcake.

There you wait to be called to the check out. If you use a credit card it appears you're served faster. I use credit card now especially since there's no minimum purchase required. I think PB and Jelly is tied with German Chocolate Cupcake for favorite. It was very good as usual. The price is comparable to other bakeries. Lots of jelly inside and the peanut butter tastes like actual peanut butter!! I did see some of my other favorite Magnolia treats. I'll return soon for a slice of cake.

Even if the food weren't so good, I would still love it because it's so fresh: there are always lots of people eating so the staff are continually refilling, and, also, it has been my experience that they round down in pricing. Like me, they like even numbers. If your plate is 1.10 pounds, they ask for $6 for vegetables or $7 for meats. This is something that makes all the difference in the world to me. Little gestures of generosity are giant.I don't bother looking at the food labels, which really don't give you more information than your own powers of observation, ""tomato,"" ""peas,"" ""okra,"" etc., but apparently I really love their vegetable heavy soups and stews, because after a few visits now, I am just realizing that I really haven't had any chunks of meat. Not that I have been avoiding the meat, just that there are always long lines of guys waiting to get at them, and I'm perfectly fine exploring all the other stuff. And all the other stuff is really really good. The atmosphere here is the opposite of intimidating and also the opposite of welcoming, it's almost anonymous, which I honestly like most of all, nobody bothers you and you don't bother anybody, how this behemoth city of ours should be, lots of people packed into a small space all taking care of themselves and having fun.",20,0.9918
529,16,12,5.0,"Okay, I just love this place. This was my 3rd time here, and it does not disappoint! Also, side note - the waiters are all so cute with their denim button downs and William Sonoma striped aprons. Had to say it.I came here for dinner this time at 7:30pm on Saturday. Everything was so good!!FOOD:-Garlic bread: comes on a large, thick toasted piece of bread, covered in butter/oil with garlic. Man this was good! Get this to start for the table. It is very flavorful.-Crispy Sweet Onions: I got this the last time I was here with friends, and decided to get it again. It's bite sized pieces of onion that are lightly breaded/cripsy. They definitely feel much more healthy and lighter than onion rings, but you can compare it to that to get an idea. Comes topped with fresh parm, and a dipping sauce that is very good and creamy. Get this!-Tomato Pizza: this was good to share as well. Thicker crust, tomato, pecorino cheese, and pieces of basil. -Cacio e Pepe: I got this last time I was here as well, and got it again! I really do love it. It's so good, and I would get it again. All the cheesy and peppery goodness.-Borsa ""Little Purse"" Pasta: I adore this pasta (my sister and I split the Cacio e Pepe and this pasta). They look like little dumplings, and are filled with ricotta cheese. The menu says hazelnut and lemon, but thinking back, I feel like there is a truffle flavor? Whatever it was, it was unreal. It's also great to split since the dumplings are so rich in flavor.DRINKS:-Honey Fashioned: Get this if you like Old Fashioneds. Love it!SERVICE:-Very good and attentive. And like I said, cute uniforms.",26,0.9982
530,22,14,5.0,"Perfection. I've not had the perfect combination of comfort, sight lines, intimacy, and sound until Stage 1 of Manhattan Theatre Club. I saw Incognito starring Geneva Carr, Charlie Cox, Heather Lind, & Morgan Spector (Separate show review upcoming). The actors aren't mic'd (at least I don't think they were, it was very directional) and the sound was excellent from my seat at stage left, E6. Stage 1 is the larger of the two and in the basement. It seats 300 or so people, so it still qualifies as intimate. The couple next to me moved over but I don't think any of the sight lines are actually bad. Row E was the perfect distance from the stage for me. But if you are front row center, there's a couple of moments when the actors are almost in your lap (Hyperbole!). Very high risers so nothing obstructs the stage. Also very comfortable seats with tons of leg room. So comfortable that sitting through an 1 hour 25 min. show with no intermission, you won't enter the stage I call ""Butt Fatigue"". There's a bar and if I'm not mistaken, two coat checks. Fully ADA Compliant, with listening devices. What I think I love the most... Stage 1 is a total cellphone dead zone.Like I said, perfect.",21,0.1263

This quant food hall will get great foot traffic for a quick meal for commuters, folks attending a event at MSG, or for the corporate crowd for a lunch. Clean and has ample tables and seats to sit for your lunch with large windows to see outside. The food hall hosts 5 food stalls and a large bar area in the back. The bar area is great for after work happy hours and the food hall is great as a central place to meet up with people and to hang out with groups. Highlights for me are the pat la frieda stall serving steak sandwiches, the mario stall serving sandwich and soup, cinamon snail with their assortment of baked goods and vegans meals, and the lobster press for a wonderful pressed lobster sandwich.I'll be back, it's a great spot for a work lunch.",24,0.9774

There were customers waiting before me so he took me in the back room, taught me to use his professional steamer and went back to help his other customers.Once he was done helping the customers before me he came back and finished steaming my shirts for me. The whole time he was so patient, kind and kept calling me by my name making the experience really personal. Then he *kindly* shoved me out the front door so I wouldn't offer to pay. Seriously such a sweet man and great business. I could tell the other customers were loyal customers as he knew them all my their first name.

533,30,22,5.0,"I should have listened to Youngest Sis when she recommended this bakery to me. She had the street cred. After 9/11, she delivered to me 3 batches of biscotti, beauties made from that divine chocolate, Valrhona. I ate 47 of them in one weekend. Following are a few reasons I have to apologize to sis and make up for lost time:S'Mores Danish-this is another masterpiece, seemingly so simple to put together and yet complex when you eat it. Bittersweet chocolate is smartly paired to cut the cloying sweetness of toasted marshmallow, the taste of the two balanced. The pleasant surprise is the crunch that comes after your teeth pass the marshmallow, then the chocolate, and meet the layers of laminated dough, right before the buttery pastry. I wondered how Gural made this. If he baked the pastry first, and layered the chocolate and marshmallow after, he magically managed to keep the crispness in the exterior. I pondered the technique after one bite, then promptly devoured it. Some lucky customers have eaten it hot out of the oven. The first time I went, I was told a customer cleaned them out and bought forty. Easy to understand why. I could eat a tray of this myself. I gave one to Oldest Sis. She sent me two emails, saying she liked it. In Older Sis code, it means, ""Get more"".Chocolate Bread-I can already tell after eating this that Arcade's breads are going to be dangerous. Arcade Bakery's pastries are too rich for me to eat more than one(well, maybe two) in a day. But the bread, I can eat that for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This bread packs a few delightful surprises. The crust is soft, not hard and crispy as in many chocolate breads. The doughy inside is like the baguette, tender, moist and with that same airy quality. Another wondrous touch were the diced orange peels in this bread. I dug out one of the minute pieces; it was only slightly sweet, seemed more preserved than candied. Then I dug out one of the small pieces of chocolate. A smooth, dark chocolate, without a strong smell and not in large chunks. The almonds are whole, toasted, fresh and crunchy. I put my nose to the velvety bread and smelled yeast, not the cocoa I expected, or the expresso powder I was sniffing for. Gural loves his bread so much, he does not let any added ingredient dominate the taste of his bread. But he has mastered baking alchemy, along with matchmaking ingredients. When I ate the bread as the sum of all its parts, the orange and almonds accentuated the cocoa and chocolate and a wonderfully addictive chocolate bread emerged. I almost ate half the loaf in one sitting. My bff showed more restraint, but raved about this bread too.Almond chocolate croissant: Another rich creation. The layers crackle not as sharply as with the almond croissant, perhaps because the filling was a wetter paste, a mix of the almonds and sugar and melted chocolate and whatever goodness Gural bakes in. I expected a more intense chocolate flavor. This one tasted more like an almond cream with chocolate flavor. A lovely breakfast pastry, but the plain almond one I thought surpassed it in texture and taste. But don't shie from buying this. It is delicious.Caramel apple brioche: A pretty ring of brioche with apple pieces on top, this pastry caught my eye at the first encounter. Gural, I realize, doesn't permit one ingredient to overpower another but understands how well they complement each other. First, I like to nibble on his ingredients separately to taste them. Tasted singly, each piece of the brioche was good, not remarkable. But when the browned apples(caramelized in sugar and browned butter?) is eaten with the bread portion of the brioche, transformation into wonderful occurs with each bite. I also loved that there wasn't even a hint of cinnamon in it.Lemon sugar brioche- I didn't try this but bought it for Oldest Sis, who said it tasted like an overpriced lemon danish. But sis, you must understand, likes an artisanal pastries as well as a cheap, processed supermarket pie. If it's like the other products from Arcade, I am sure it is very excellent.I know I love this place after writing a super long review that I had to put out in three parts. Live your life without regret. Visit this bakery pronto.",32,0.9985

Summer isn't here, until the Puerto Rican ice cream cart has arrived! They're smart, they take the key spot right in front of the school entrance. So every day between 3-4 pm, the kids swarm the cart. The cart usually arrives for the warm weather before school lets out. But they stay the whole summer since there seem to be a lot of kids summer school camps.Love practicing my spanish. Er, spanglish. Tried the mango, not a big fan. But the coco is pretty solid. Reminds me so much of my trips to the Caribbean and Central America! Damn, one dollar? Crazy, can't beat that.

Before I start on the delicious melt in your mouth dessert itself - I've got to give it to the staff. The owners and employees are incredibly patient and helpful, and off the chart friendly. Now onto the product itself..They serve delicious quality shaved ice! Finally, a place that sells shaved ice cream with the perfect fluffy consistency and texture that does not melt into liquid in an instant. My matcha shaved ice stayed nice and cold in the 90 degree heat. Their base price is $6.25 for an order of shaved ice+boba on top. Additional toppings start at 50 cents each. These guys are GENEROUS! You definitely get your money's worth, trust me. My matcha had the perfect amount of green tea flavor. Not too much that it was bitter, and not too little unlike some stingy establishments. My friends ordered the passion fruit, and lychee flavors. All three of us had the same verdict - YUMMY. Passion fruit wins hands down for me though! It was the perfect combo of tart&sweet and did not taste artificial at all. Toppings are also well kept behind the counter and everything was very sanitary. Fruits are fresh, and toppings such as the boba, mochi, etc. are not stale. If their soft opening is already this successful, I can only wonder what NY Frost Factory will have in store for foodies like myself.

It's not often that I have had a well-curated five-course meal in a private chef's abode. Scratch that...I never have, until recently.I was lucky enough to be invited to a private residence in the city to experience the fine cooking of Chef Shuchi, the brains behind 29 Calories. In this particular brunch, she made small servings of some of the breakfasts she remembers from her childhood, but re-imagined and improved upon. She served a story with each dish, and we noshed on various dishes with oats, vegetables, meats, eggs, coffee, and cake, each with a truly unique Indian influence within them. Her hospitality and warmth is pretty unparalleled, and she was very open when we had questions about the food, the spices she used, her background in cooking, et al. The two hours I spent at this brunch was too short! I can only hope to be lucky enough to be able to eat some of her dishes again! It was all exquisite!

From the wooden bowls that the food comes in to the hot water thermos sitting around, everything here reminded me of home. There were even classic Chinese phrases painted on the wall that exactly resembled those I see everywhere in China. The atmosphere hit me with so much nostalgia, I could not wait to try the food. Food: We ordered the Husband and Wife beef appetizer which is one of my favorite Szhechuan appetizers ever. The dish was the perfect amount of spicy to numbing and a great way to wake up the palate. For the main event, the mala xiang guo, I ordered some lamb, beef round, spam, pork belly, wood ear, shiitake mushrooms, squid, fish ball (get the one with meat inside), fish cake, lotus root, celtuce, bean curd sheet, tofu pocket and glass noodles. It was difficult to narrow down all the choices since they all sounded so good! The selection is exactly what I would expect if I went to a Mala xianguo place in China. They have a great selection of offals too that I will for sure try next time. I ordered the Spicy level which was perfect. Just spicy enough to feel that sweet, sweet burn but not enough where I couldn't enjoy the food. The Wang Wang milk drink is key to cooling down the spice also. Overall, what an amazing trip down memory lane with some amazing food. I can't believe such a place exist in East Village and not in Chinatown!

541,18,5,5.0,"The poke craze has definitely hit NYC, and Wisefish is leading the pack in terms of quality.I was both dreading and looking forward to the day when poke would make it big here. Sure enough, the second a video was made about New York's ""trendiest new food"" at Pokeworks, lines went out the door and hype was blown out of proportion. Nothing gets people going like a viral video about sushi burritos. In hopes of avoiding crowds, I went to Chelsea's Wisefish on a Sunday morning.Having had both Pokeworks and Wisefish, my vote goes to Wisefish. Pokeworks is good, don't get me wrong, but Wisefish is better. You can taste the difference in fish quality and feel the difference in friendliness. Both places are similar in terms of setup, which consists of Chipotle-style BYO-bowls and pre-set options, as well as ingredients and prices. A regular bowl at either will run you about $11. Not cheap, but it'll fill you up.POKE:Wisefish keeps it simple with protein choices between tuna, salmon, and tofu. Beyond brown and white rice, you also have the option to get zucchini noodles as a base. I got them out of curiosity along with rice and was pleasantly surprised. I think of the zucchini more as a topping since it complemented the fish so well, and IMO rice is a must with poke. You then have your choice of toppings, which range from scallions to avocado cream to fried onion. Finish it off with a sauce. You can go with a spicy option like wasabi shoyu or spicy citrus shoyu or keep it classic with soy sauce and sesame oil. My suggestion for poke is to always go simple rather than complicated. Too many toppings make it flavor-overload, and poke should be all about the fish.ATMOSPHERE:I think my favorite thing about Wisefish was not the food, but the people. The girl checking me out was friendly and very informative, telling me how they make an effort to locally source their fish and keep it authentic. I really appreciated the enthusiasm and genuine interest in her store. On that note, the store itself is nicely set up, with a long table down the middle and a couple of window seats below hanging lights. Overall, I'd love to come back.

544,22,16,5.0,"The hummus is very good, but it's not worlds better than what you can get elsewhere.What *is* better: the pita. I watched a chef make the pitas fresh, putting them one by one in the wood burning oven, letting them rise, then swooshing them out with her big pita spatula, and letting them cool just until they were ready to serve. They were transcendent. I would come back for the pitas alone. You cannot get pita this good anywhere else that I know of. I can think of an Arab bakery in Paterson, NJ, that once made me a pita this good (and whole wheat, no less) and I can think of other very good pitas to be had around the city, but this stuff here stands apart.Other stuff:* The salatim (little side dishes of salad) are a mixed bunch and change frequently. Based on what I had on just one visit, they're nice but not essential. If you stuck to the Israeli salad that came with the hummus and maybe some pickles & onion, you'd be fine.* They serve shakshuka for breakfast, through 11:30am. I didn't have it but saw others having it: imagine a cast iron skillet filled with tomato and eggs, baked in a wood burning oven. I'd try it.* Don't skip the limonana. Limon means lemon in Hebrew.

545,10,10,5.0,"Love Jivamukti yoga!! The space seems very authentic. The two things I noticed about the facility are the clean floors and the high quality of their mats. Not only are the mats complimentary for members and drop ins, but they are also cleaned right after each use with their laundry machines. The term 'Jivamukti' means individual liberation. Jivamukti Yoga School embraces the philosophy of Ahimsa, Bhakti yoga, Raja yoga, Karma yoga, Nada Yoga, Dhyana and Chanting. The instructors here are very professional and they make sure each student receives a hands on adjustment while the breaths are also counted for awareness.I love the Spiritual Warrior class. It is an hour long and unlike most practices, it starts off with an inversion and a backbend...it's different but it works. The mats are lined up against the wall and the flows are simple but the way they sequenced it does work a sweat. Jivamukti Open is an hour and 35 minutes long that starts off with 3 oms, a chant and a philosophical speech before the physical asanas begin. Unlike the Spiritual Warrior class, the inversions and the backbends are saved toward the later part of the class when the heats are built. The practice ends with a seated meditation follow by savasana. On the downside, there's only one shower and no mirror in the changing room. And the lockers are really really small and it's for rental only...if you have a large bag, it wouldn't fit. They also have a gluten free vegan café attached. It's cute but some items are overpriced like $13 to $16 for a quesadilla.Overall for someone who must have her inversions and backbends to call it a full practice, you can't go wrong with Jivamukti. However it would be amazing if we can have hanumansana and gong savasana added :) 4.5 stars.P.S: They also have MySore Ashtanga",17,0.9892

The scoop looks like a strawberry color ice cream, BUT, it is/says it's a Concord grape, donut soil, rainbow sprinkles, & raspberry coulis(sauce) all blended in, but not overly blended, so you get a GREAT CRUNCH FROM THE RAINBOW SPRINKLES, you simply have cartwheeling tastebuds from the fantastic flavors of grape, raspberry, & rainbow sprinkles crunch.

547,17,6,5.0,"There aren't too many places in the City that have a burger that can stand against Salvation Burger's ""Salvation Burger."" Think steak on a bun, like Peter Lugers and Minetta Tavern... this burger belongs on that list.For those that don't know, after winning 2 separate Michelin stars at two previous restaurants (Spotted Pig and The Breslin) primarily for the burger offered at each, James Beard winning chef April Bloomfield decided to open a joint in Midtown dedicated to the burger, and it does not disappoint.Bloomfield selected her cattle ranch and slaughterhouse personally upstate, uses only locally sourced ingredients, has a few butchers in the basement, all in the name of having complete control over the burger and its contents. The meat on the burger is expertly cut and ground in-house, with a high fat ratio that is tough to get right from distributor or store bought meat.The burger patty was about the diameter of a hockey puck, and about 50% thicker. We had 6 in our party, and ordered 6 Salvation Burgers, all medium rare. They all came out hot and fresh, all cooked to medium rare perfectly, all topped with the same crispy onions and perfectly toasted sesame bun, top and bottom. The flavor of the meat shone through, seasoned minimally with salt and pepper, and maybe a few other undistinguishable items, but focused solely on bringing out the flavor of the meat.Bloomfield cooks all of the meat over a wood-fired grill. That is unheard of for a restaurant of this size, that is pumping out this many burgers. It added a tiny bit of smokiness that complimented well with the onions.Aside from the burgers, the McDonald's inspired thin shoestring fries were spot on, and the shakes -- OMFG the shakes --were amazing. I highly recommend the Toasted Marshmallow shake which captures the caramelized marshmallow taste in a cup lined with caramel sauce and thick vanilla ice cream.Everything was perfect, but there were some bad points on our trip. The server lost our name in the app used to track tables. When we went back 2hrs after dropping our name to check, they looked it up and twas nowhere to be found. They did end up hooking us up with a table immediately, but what if we never came back to check and just waited for the text?The place is pricey, with the Salvation Burger a whopping $25. I think it was worth it, being in the upper echelon of burgers in the City, but damn good burgers can be found for much less in the City elsewhere.The ambiance of the place (at least at night) is a little dark for my taste, more nightclubby than fancy burger joint. Pop some candles in there or something, people want to see each other, and this amazing burger.Staff was well trained and helpful, despite only being open for 2 weeks at the time of my visit.Overall, 4.5 stars which rounds up to a rare 5-star from me for Salvation Burger. I hope you get another Michelin star Chef Bloomfield, you definitely deserve it on this one.",28,0.9932
548,25,15,5.0,"I'd been looking for a way to vary my workout routine once I felt like I'd reached a plateau. For some time now, women all around me have been raving and going crazy about Pure Barre. I'm here to join the crazy train and support ALL of the hype about this form of exercise. To be fair, you could find a cheaper barre class at another gym/franchise that isn't trademarked like Pure Barre/Pure Body, Vixen, CrossFit, Zumba....but I went with Pure Barre and signed up for their New Client Special for $99, which grants you access to unlimited classes for one month. Then you're required to either pay for individual classes to the tune of $27, or sign up for a real membership, which I have not yet looked into. That said, I LOVE PURE BARRE BRONXVILLE. I would recommend going to a ""Breaking Down the Barre"" workshop, which I had the pleasure of doing with Mariellen. This workshop is great for those of you who haven't yet taken a barre class, so that the instructor can really take the time to demonstrate the proper form and technique. I say this because, classes are fast-paced and expensive, so you definitely don't want to waste your time and money being too far behind the other people in your class. You'll walk in, take off your shoes and be greeted warmly by one of many women with a friendly smile. Classes are done without shoes (and in socks), so you can buy your handy pure barre socks with foot grips for $14/pair in any studio. Yes, it's another expensive thing, and you probably can get through your classes with your normal gym socks, but I find that the grips help. Yes, I could buy my own grippy, Spiderwoman socks, but I just bought a bunch at Pure Barre and called it a day. Classes are CHALLENGING! But that's why you came here, right? You want to earn those muscle shakes when you're on the bar. Come into your seat, now lift and tuck, and squeeze and tuck. I'm actually obsessed with this program. You might think that nothing is being accomplished by moving parts of your body just an inch, but you are really working. I dare anyone who thinks they are in prime shape to take these classes and not feel like they're working muscles they've been neglecting. So far I've had class with Mariellen, Erica, Jill P, Stacey, and Sian. All of these ladies have been wonderfully helpful to a beginner like me, and have taken the time to answer my questions thoughtfully. I feel like I'm really getting my money and time's worth, and I love the environment. I'm sure there are larger Pure Barre locations in more densely populated areas, but the Pure Barre Bronxville has only one studio, and that seems to be sufficient. Downloading the app makes it super easy to sign up for classes, which you must do, if you expect to participate. Walk-ins are allowed (but not for Platform) but it's more likely than not, that you won't find space in the walk-in of your choice because there's usually a wait list before that. As I mentioned, Pure Barre is trendy and everybody wants to get in there to feel the burn and build that lean muscle. I have no regrets besides not starting this program sooner. I feel that it's a challenging supplement to my usual routine and I noticed an additional 3 lb drop in my weight after alternating Pure Barre with my cardio and lifting routine. I intend to continue that and really push myself. Pure Barre instructors will help to push their clients, too. One of my favorite things I've ever heard in class was, ""Don't let your body decide when you give up!"" It's all about trying to get yourself to a point where you can mentally push past the pain and the muscle spasms. Once you do, you're gold!My cousin's wife came with me the other day and we had a blast! No, I'm lying we both were dying and having uncontrollable leg spasms, but dammit it was worth it! Seriously, I plan to be a Pure Barre junkie some day and can't wait until I can call myself a member of the 100+ club. This studio is clean, located right in town and you'll leave every class feeling great about you. What more can you ask for?",28,0.9967
549,26,13,5.0,"Aside from being very convenient for me (literally right across the street), I've only been to Starbucks once, and it's because the hours here are shorter on weekends. Having said that, I wanted to wait to write a review since I knew I'd be coming here frequently if worth it. I got the matcha a couple times, and although the craze of taking pictures of this green drink has swept Instagram recently, I was never compelled to try it. I saw a couple weeks ago how matcha actually has a good amount of caffeine but there are more health benefits than coffee, and there's no crash. So I tried it and it's not bad! However I don't have any other place to compare this one to. The cappuccino and flat white were also good. Another place within the past two weeks that I found that doesn't need sugar. That's how you know it's good coffee. Even Howard Stern has said, you don't like coffee if you have to add sugar. And it's so true. I've never been a big fan, and always ordered vanilla lattes or mochas to mask the taste. The avocado smash is also a recent ""hot item"" to order for brunch all over the city. Why now? I'm not sure. I've been eating avocados forever... It's pretty much the only green thing I eat. But it is nice to not prepare it yourself. How lazy do I sound? Price wise, I understand it doesn't make sense to spend however much it costs since I've been putting avocado on toast myself for years. But.... They do make it well. So if you're lazy, or in a rush, order it! This is my new coffee place.",32,0.9665

Five reasons why:- The den is doubling down on its commitment to my neighborhood, Tribeca. Taking over the second floor and expanding the space on the third floor!- The medley of instructors continues to get stronger. Don't believe me? Try the 'slow burn' with Terri, or yin it with Braxton, or sweat it with Brooke!- The community keeps growing (formulaically, that is the % visiting over 10x a month times the % of time they spend bonding with each other times 10^4)- Den mascot Josie and sidekick Murphy can give Bo and Sunny a run for their money.

552,29,27,5.0,"Covina. So hot right now. Covina.This place is blowing up, and it's blowing up fast. Get your reservations in now before you start the futile fight with OpenTable. It's already reaching that level, and it's only been open a couple of weeks. Came here on a Tuesday night at 8:15 and the place was absolutely packed. Foodies all think the same, it seems. As other reviewers have mentioned, there's an odd little cafe in the front which is very casual and seemingly out of place. But saunter on down to hostess post (new band name?) and you'll start to see the grandeur that is Covina. Expansive bar and an absolutely massive dining area. So while it *was* packed, the feng shui made it such that it didn't feel claustrophobic/cramped in any way. It's upscale, but approachable-upscale. And despite the size, there's a lovely warmth to this place. It's intimate but in a totally platonic way. Everyone present - staff included - just seemed particularly joyous. Before I jump into food, I'll make a few notes about their cocktail program. It's...different. Not bad different. Just different. When anything seems original and inventive, I'm going to take note and I'll likely think of it fondly. So before dinner, you get - you guessed it - the ""before dinner"" drinks menu. Like all cocktails here, they don't tell you the whole story on the menu. Don't give it up to soon. Make 'em wait. Leave something to be desired. Play hard to get (but not with me, I'm too old for mind games). Anyway, I love that approach when it comes to food - so why not drinks? Before dinner, I went with Covina's take on a Lemon Drop and chose gin over vodka as my base (I always opt for gin if I can). Impeccably done, complete with a generously sugared rim. My dining companion went with the Boulevardier, which was fantastic as well. One of my favorite classics. Remember that part about leaving something to be desired? They did that with the *actual* drink menu. We knew the ""before dinner"" list couldn't be it. For whatever reason, we didn't get that menu initially, but our bubbly, wonderful waitress fixed that promptly. From this menu, I tried the Rose Hill Sour (ice pictured - made w/ ""rosey-cucumbery gin, mezcal-rose cordial, lemon juice and cucumber ice) which was dynamite. Refreshing and well-balanced. And that green ice cube! I then tried the ""Pass That Dutch"" (pop that pop that jiggle that fat...hail to KWEEN MISSY), which is gin-based (Dutch Genver) w/ apricot and amaro dell'erborista. Rich and boozy. Perfect nightcap.[Text here raving about the service, me trying to find adjectives to do everyone justice, failing miserably, moving onto the food.]Fresh Sardines w/ pickled roasted red pepper and fennel: A-/AThis was all kinds of fresh. And a very inventive preparation. I'm not sure I've ever had sardines, but regardless I've never seen them presented in this way. They are very very fishy so if you don't like that...steer clear. But the pickled roasted red pepper added a great flavor antidote to the saltiness of the sardines, so my full bite rating remains high.Hungarian Fry Bread w/ smoked salmon, kefir ranch, herbs: A++The star. THE STAR. I felt like I needed to call every single one of my family members after each bite of this dish. My mom would remark: ""I'm kvelling!"". My grandmother would call the flavor ""mashugana"" and would demand to meet the balabusta who created this divine dish. My dad would try to pretend he knows Yiddish and say some phrase involving the word ""schlep"". The point: this is one of the best things I've eaten in a very long time. I'm not sure what went into making the kefir ranch, but that hands-down made the dish. Yogurt/dill/caper semen of the gods (the Jewish god, obviously). And the bread was unbelievable as well - slightly crispy but perfectly spongy. Ugh. Wood-Grilled Gulf Shrimp w/ red flint florani polenta, smoked Oaxacan pasilla chile sauce, cilantro: A+I think I'm on record as saying I don't like polenta. But this wasn't your average polenta. It was quite grainy, which I adored. I'm a sucker for texture - I like chunky peanut butter, pulpy orange juice, cookies and cream ice cream and coarse grain mustard. So this was right up my alley. The shrimp were grilled to perfection, and I expected nothing less. But the confluence of flavors in the polenta/chile sauce combo was seriously something. As far as execution goes, this baby wins.Housemade Salsicia Pizza w/ roasted red peppers, house fior de latte, mozzarella, tomato: AI first need to say that this pizza was my 4th choice. I would have preferred the funghi or the fontina/brussels sprout (my dream combo), but my company hates brussels sprouts and is allergic to pine nuts. So our options were limited. THIS ALL SAID I still seriously enjoyed this pizza. The sausage was everything that homemade sausage should be, the mozzarella was fluffy, plentiful and heavenly. I've probably had better pizza in my life, but this was as well-done as I've seen.",36,0.9984

We practically had dinner with our neighbors which was sorta semi awkward lol but it's what you get in Manhattan. staff: loved our waitress! We ordered individual slices but she made a suggestion that saved us money with the entire pie and for seating, she tried her best to get us, a group of 7, seated. Although the wait was about 1 hour on a Saturday night. Food: yummmmm and so filling. One slice is enough in my opinion. We got the classic spinach artichoke pie which they are famous for and was not disappointed. Perfect crust- none of that pizza falling apart in your hand nonsense. The crust was well baked and could handle the heavy sauce and toppings. It wasn't too oily and was perfectly fresh when we got it. Price: the entire pie is $32 and we split it so ended up being about $5 a person. Talk about a steal!! No dollar slice pizza but I'd rather pay $5 for this pizza than $1 for an overly oily street slice with sloppy crust. Will I be back? Yes because.....pizza.",44,0.9864

I knew the space was open and we asked one of the traffic cops where to enter. At this time, because the outside entrances aren't finished, we had to enter on Liberty Street south of the station and take an escalator down a few flights. Once you are in, all you have to do is follow the signs to The Oculus. It's worth it. The entire development is still far from being finished, however the raw marble clad space is terrific.

555,39,30,5.0,"I was introduced to my very first ramen and pork belly bun experience at Ippudo NY in the East Village over five years ago. I had no idea what to expect then and now years later, here I am a self-proclaimed pro...well not really. I had some time to kill and wanted to eat something before a Yelp Off-Broadway event, so I searched my Yelp app for Asian cuisines nearby and noticed this spot was a mere two blocks away. I arrived to this Westside location a few minutes before 6:00pm and there at the empty entryway were two patrons who at that exact moment were being directed to their table by the hostess, perfect timing. The efficient hostess returned promptly and immediately guided me to the last seat at the modern looking communal counter. Little did I realize I lucked out getting seated so quickly. Just like the East Village location, every single customer is greeted with a Japanese welcome, which thank goodness isn't as loud and intrusive here on the Westside considering its more intimate and warm atmosphere. I was tempted to order an appetizer, but I know ramen servings are always plentiful. So I chose to have ramen only; the Drum Heart Ramen. The listed ingredients looked like a perfect combination that I knew I would enjoy. As I waited for my meal, I looked around the counter and it seemed as though I may have been the only one ordering this soup, and now I started thinking that I may have made the wrong choice. But once my order arrived and I took my first taste of this soup the umami jumped right out of that spoon offering hot, spicy, sweet, sour, salty, earthy, fragrant, rich, bold, unctuousnesses...oh my goodness...oh my goodness! It was a titillating palate dancer of flavors, which consisted of fresh herbs, pork belly, cilantro, and all others including the largest perfectly poached egg I have ever seen. All of these surrounded in a broth that had this look of charcoal and look of deep dark chocolate, which looked scary and intriguing all at the same time. All of my senses were engaged in this ramen experience. I never finish an entire bowl of ramen, but for this I had to. I will say that I am glad I came in not reading any prior reviews that may have swayed me to try what the masses had been ordering, my decision turned out to be a very good one indeed. For an impromptu visit, I was happy with everything. The impeccable service of the waiters, hostess, bussers, chefs, all efficient and friendly and run this operation like a well oiled machine. An experience I would love time and time again. My last note. Upon leaving a little less than an hour later, I could barely get out of the restaurant as the previously empty entryway was now hella crowded with patrons waiting to be seated...Ippudo Westside, well worth the wait.",45,0.9976

For 2, we shared 2 toasts, 1 cold dish, and 2 hot dishes. The carrot toast and fennel hummus toast were both very tasty, great flavor and texture combinations. The salt baked sweet potato was like a hearty potato salad, quite a substantial dish and so pretty to look at! The Maitake Mushrooms was my favorite - it's easy to love these mushrooms. Great sear, meaty interior, with a few bits and pieces of other vegetables to pair bites with. The basmati rice is a good option if you're looking for something more filling. It's similar to a risotto, and again the presentation was gorgeous. Make a reservation (since it's so easy to) because the space is pretty small, and request a seat at the bar so you can watch all the cooking in action. Service could've been more attentive, but everyone was nice including the chefs.

It also includes a side of chopped up kimchi, Korean-style pickled cucumber, lettuce and spring greens. It's recommended to mix it all up, I like to keep it a little separated so you can experience the flavors of the ingredients individually and your mouth doesn't get too bored. But it's far far from boring!It came with a side of slightly spicy miso soup w/ green onions, Nutty mixed green salad, kimchi, and 2 Vegetable Dumplings.Vegetable DumplingsI didn't even realized there was no meat in there. It's lightly fried, sprinkled with sesame seeds and seasoning and 100% YUM. Kalbi Dumplings According to my friend, the Kalbi Dumplings, tasted like real Kalbi, but now instead of get big serving size you can get it in dumpling form! Comes with 3 pieces. Tofu and Kimchi The tofu were little fried nuggets of deliciousness with a side of wilted kimchi. The kimchi was aged perfectly and had the right texture that complimented the bite size tofu! All my plates were clean and empty! A sign of a good meal! SERVICE: It's so awesome when restaurants leave a bottle of water at your leisure whenever your glass get empty.

564,26,12,5.0,"The last time I saw the Rockettes live, I was a kid. We had an opportunity to see it on July 4th and I grabbed at the chance. My BF hasn't seen the Rockettes either in many many years. Let's just say I got really excited at the first scene when the Rockettes came out. I love the way they dance in unison. There must be about 50 of them. The costumes that the Rockettes were wearing in each scene were really nice too. They are mesmerizing to watch with their perfect formations and perfectly unison kicks and choreography. I love how NY the Rockettes are. The story plot is pretty light, it's about a family visiting NYC on vacation and the two kids get separated from the parents in Grand Central subway station. So we follow the kids as they go through a NYC adventure as they try to find their parents again. We follow the kids to some pretty iconic NYC sites such as the MET, Wall Street and the bull, NYC Public Library Main Branch with the 2 lions, Central Park and the Alice and the Wonderland statue, Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island, Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, and of course the Rockettes. The famous statues all over NYC come alive to help the kids reunite with their parents. I felt like I visited everywhere in NYC without leaving my seat. That was pretty awesome. This show is a tribute to everything that is NYC. The special effects, lighting, visual stage design, costumes, puppetry, choreography, etc were all awe inspiring. The Egytian scene was cool, the rain on stage looked fun, the couture costumes. Everything was top notch in this show. It's definitely worth the money. A lot of the numbers and scenes just wow'ed me. I never realized how big the stage was until I saw it from the Mezzanine. To fully see the wonderful Rockettes kick line and multiple dance formations, the best seats are from the front center mezzanine. To also see the special effects that light up the entire theatre, the front mezzanine is the best seat. If you sat in the orchestra, you'll miss how the Rockettes dance formations look like from the top and you would totally miss the action happening on the sides of the theatre that are eye level with the mezzanine. There is also no way to see from the orchestra the special effects and lighting of the entire theatre in a lot of the different scenes which all were very impressive. There is definitely more special effects and lighting design in this production than the majority of the shows on Broadway.

I went on a Saturday around 5ish because I was just meeting up with a group of friends for a drink of two. It was rather quiet and mostly that is because they were probably switching over from brunch to dinner time. The mixologist (Cyllan) was inviting and very informed...let's make this clear ...he has his craft down to an art AND HE IS SERIOUS ABOUT IT. Drinks are about 14-15 bucks a piece, but I consider worthy of forking over my hard earned dollars. After several drinks I decided to try a dish off their bar menu and the cod fritters sounded great after having a drink or two. It was a great appetizers and definitely had me wanted to come back to try the dinner menu.Around 6 or 7 ish it picked up and almost every table was full with patrons along with the bar.

570,20,18,5.0,"I thought this place was better than West Malaysia and Nyona. It's such a hole in the wall and I never knew this fusion restaurant existed until my sister mentioned it to me. Their roti was at least $1.50 cheaper than many other places which is a steal and the pancake was such an interesting texture + taste which I enjoyed plenty. The chicken wings stuffed with sticky rice was also interesting, it was really crispy and tasty.My sister had ordered a tofu + chicken and rice dish and the sauce they had smelled amazing and it was a good amount of serving and delicious. I had the hainese chicken and their chicken serving was generous. What really amazed me was that they served their hainese chicken with hainese flavored rice, every other Malaysian location I went to serves hainese chicken with basic white rice.The steps are a bit steep so I wouldn't come here if you're drunk as you might roll down the stairs but do try this place as they have great service, are never busy and in my opinion serve up some delicious malaysian/indonesian food.",23,0.9744
571,29,16,5.0,"About a month ago at my work I noticed one of my coworker's beautiful knives after he removed it from it's wooden sheath. Being that I'd only experienced those crapping plastic bland guards, I was immediately in awe of this new set up. After a few uses of this Togiharu petty knife, I was sold. I had to have one.To my great surprise, my wonderful mother took action before I could, and purchased a Togiharu petty and santoku knife set for me. Thanks ma!!! :-D To make sure the knives would stay as magnificent as they were on the day I received them, I traveled to Korin to purchase proper wooden sheaths and ask about sharpening stones. All I can say is I received the most educational and pleasant help I've ever received when shopping for knives or their accessories. The attendants are so knowledgeable and friendly. From the moment you get there, they greet you and guide you through the store, answering all your questions and giving you all the information you need to pick the right knives and accessories. Truly A+ service.After a few weeks of working with my new Togiharus, I'm so thankful to have come across them. What absolutely amazing knives. They're relatively lightweight, have a handle which fits comfortably in my tiny-winy hand, and have a slightly thinner bland then European style knives; thus allowing them to be more easily sharpened, and allowing you to perform precision cuts with ease, butcher meat and fish like nobodies business (hot knife through butter!), and not crack root vegetables when cutting. Just be sure to not leave this knives wet or exposed to acid for too long. They will rust and discolor!My advice to you: if you are a culinary professional, take the time to travel to this playland. You'll be there for longer than you think, and leave with a lighter wallet, but you'll have a blast. If you're a home culinary enthusiast, still pay Korin a visit. You'll find flatware that will be perfect for your next extravagant dinner party, learn a ton about knives and how to care for them, and maybe even get a show from their in-house sharpener working his magic on the giant stone. This place is so awesome.",40,0.9956
572,27,22,5.0,"Peter is definitely the man with the hands. On Chloe C's review and recommendation I came here after a massage therapist I like was too sick to work on me. I like my massages the way I love chocolate. Better not to have a massage than a bad one. But I was in severe pain. I usually pass on these cheap Asaian spas because I feel like I am taking advantage of an overworked, underpaid drone and end up tipping 50-60 percent for what has always been a mediocre session. Luckily, my tip was not out of pity. He has more feeling in his hands than many massage therapists I know, and is professional and accommodating. If you are open to a different style than Swedish you can have your knots worked out here. They end with a few minutes of hot stone. Picky person that I am, I bring my own lotion and you can too. The place is definitely no frills, with tables with a hole for your face. The tables are harder than at a posh spa but if you want deep tissue, it's better for that work anyway. The rooms are stalls with curtains for a door so if you want quiet, come at off hours. It is clean. It's a win win if you plan it right. The price is cheap enough at $48 an hour so you can leave a generous tip(I always hand it to them directly btw) for an underpaid, talented worker and you leave feeling better, body wise and karma wise.",35,0.9948

576,36,21,5.0,"When I was growing up, my mother used to make me sandwiches for lunch. She was a very hard working woman who did her best to put a roof over the kids heads and made sure we were never hungry. Being as busy as she was, she didn't always have the time to make the fanciest sandwiches or come up with a diverse meal plan for us. We were on a budget. Lunch for school was often simply ham and cheese in between two slices of white bread.I ate that for years. Or at least I tried to. Unless I was extremely hungry, sometimes I would just throw the sandwich away. I'm not sure what type of ham she would get for these sandwiches, but eventually, I just couldn't eat ham anymore. I think I told my mother to stop making these sandwiches for me and she never did again. I was a very unappreciative kid. To this year, I've never willfully ordered ham of any kind (bacon, pork belly, and the kind are a different story).Fast forward 12-13 years later, and I'm told about one of the best bakeries in New York City--Arcade. Deciding on what sandwich to get, I wanted something on their famous baguettes. But when I read the menu, I saw the ingredients in the sandwich... cheese, butter, and... ham.Not wanting any other type of bread for my sandwich, I swallowed my old hatred for ham. After snapping pictures of this plain looking sandwich, I delve in. A big bite for this crunchy-on-the-outside, slightly-chewy-on-the-inside baguette. My teeth sunk in getting into each layer. First into the subtle butter. Then into the cheese and the HAM simultaneously...The harmony of all four simple ingredients in my mouth had me wondering what I was eating. Was this how sandwiches were supposed to taste.. with HAM??? This could possibly be the only ham sandwich I can ever eat again.Now, I understand what my mother had to do to feed three children at the same time while holding down a full-time job, working overtime, and trying to get her degree at the same time... This sandwich made me appreciate that. It brought back memories of sandwiches I ate for years and threw away for years.Thank you, Mom, for all your sacrifice and thank you Arcade Bakery for helping me appreciate her.",29,0.9827

579,41,34,5.0,"How to survive a Tone House workout:1. Wear long pants that cover your knees, unless you don't mind having your knees slide over the astroturf.2. Come 10 min early, so you can stretch. The warm up is tough here, and you will be sprinting like crazy, so stretch beforehand.3. Its about TEAM. Its all about TEAMWORK. You cheer everyone on, you cheer till the last person touches that finish line. 4. Show up. Workout hard (drop dead in between then get up again, then drop dead, then get up again). Finish strong. Finish proud. Go home and sit on couch. Other useful tips:1. There are cubby holes for your bags and hooks for your coats. 2. There is a unisex bathroom but no showers.3. You are provided with a towel and a bottle of water. There is also a water fountain.4. First timers get a special rate of $20.5. You can sign up for classes online.6. Tone House is on the second floor.Tone House is the hardest workout in New York. I take all sorts of classes at Equinox, run marathons, but Tone House was like ""random hard workout class"" x4. Its like your usual bootcamp class but on crack. To be honest, I was so nervous coming here, I already felt like puking in my Uber. I don't even feel that nervous going for a job interview. I got there early and started stretching. I didn't know anybody going there obviously, there were some others who showed up with their friends. But the camaraderie and team spirit is so great that everyone will cheer for you, that you will feel as if the whole team is your friend. My coach was Tamara and she was excellent. Half of my class happened to be newbies aka first timers, so I felt a little less intimidated.Well, as I mentioned above, the warm up isn't some simple stretching. The warm up is tough. According to Tamara, if you can survive the work out, you can survive the class. We spent the first 10 min sprinting over these blocks with the faster people going first and the slower people behind. The faster people will catch up with the slower people so you better keep running. You will have to jump over the hurdles, and also jump over them sideways. You will even do push ups in between those hurdles. After the first 10 min, I was pouring in sweat and panting. Now for the real work out. We did lots of bear crawls. We also got into a plank position, put sliders under both feet, and dragged ourselves from one end of the room to the other with our arms. Tamara also divided us into little groups of 3-4 people and each group would take turns doing certain exercises (putting the gliders under your hands and pushing them with your legs, getting down on all 4s and hoping forward with your legs, then moving your hand forwards, then hopping again till the end of the room etc). While doing these, the rest of the class would cheer you on. I wasn't the fastest at moving around on gliders under my feet while holding a plank position and trying to pull myself forward. In fact, I had to take lots of breaks on my knees (which is why you should wear long pants that cover your knees), and ended up being the slowest of my group. I must have been with ultra fit D1 athletes or something. What got me through doing 3 laps was the wonderful team cheering me on, Tamara even came beside me and did it with me and helped me get to the finish line. I still remember standing up with sweat dripping down my red face, and everyone was clapping for me, telling me I had done a good job. There was one girl in my group who hid in the toilet at times, because she was scared to do the exercises. My philosophy is to suck it up and do it, and finish strong. It doesn't matter how old you are, or how fat/ thin you are, just do it, mind over matter. However, I would strongly recommend being in decent shape, if not, you will probably end up puking. We also did push ups with gliders under our hands. The last set of exercises that we did was lunging back, and to the side, followed by jumping lunges. I have fairly strong legs, I can run marathons, however Tone House had me burnt out. I realized my quads were so exhausted that I could barely jump. My jumps were getting lower and lower haha. I was actually shocked that my legs were this tired.Finally, we got into a circle and did all sorts exercises like burpees, push ups, running in place etc. You feel like a hero when you are done. I was so tired I had to outside and sit somewhere just to catch my breath. I felt as if I was still panting and sweating 25 min later. Yes, its that hard of a work out. Its no joke. I came home and sat on the couch for another 30 min.Tone House takes working out to a whole new level. You might want to cancel partying plans after Tone House, because sitting on the couch after that with a bottle of wine and some cheese (Trader Joe's is nearby) is the way to do it.",48,0.9976

583,39,17,5.0,"""Patience and Fortitude conquer all things."" - Ralph Waldo Emerson (and/or Fiorello LaGuardia) Five stars. Hot new bar in LES.Came here on a Friday night (2/19), not realizing they'd just opened the night before! I read an article written in the fall about the bar, but guess the opening had been delayed a bit. It was so nice to experience the place when it's less crazy, because I know in a few weeks it'll be impossible to get in. Also, when I visited, Giuseppe Gonzalez himself was the bartender! (""The very handsome half-Italian half-Puerto Rican"" as Pablo the server described him.)To drink: The Tough Room - guinness and whiskey sour. ""Tastes bright and foamy, but unmistakably guinness."" - Marissa L., my adventurous companion Trinidad Sour - rye, lemon, orgeat, angostura. If drinks/flavors could have shapes, this drink would taste round. Like a perfect circle. It's sweet but not. Deep but not. Heavy but light. And in a weird way, tasted like a chocolate covered orange. (Please don't let that description read too specifically and turn you off. That's just the only other flavor combination that made me feel similarly!)The Twin Lion - rye, lemon, sugar, egg white, wine. Pretty drink with four visible layers. Frothy and foamy on top with the egg white, then silky, then the hit of wine. Very fun. Czarine - vodka, dry vermouth, apricot liquor, bitter. ""Mmm, tasty!"" - Marissa again. To eat: Thai Chili Wings. These were perfect. Right amount of crisp on the skin but soft from the meat. Served not too hot (as wing often are). And the thai chili flavor was sweet and tangy without being too thick or syrupy sweet, again how these wings usually are. I think there were 10 wings. They come with a sauce that tastes sour creamy-y, and an onion-y slaw. I didn't love either accoutrement alone, but the trio of chicken, sauce, and slaw was divine. Shrimp Cocktail. Thick big shrimp (5) served on an asian-y carrot slaw. The cocktail sauce was BOMB. Thick, chunky, spicy, and red. Lol. Again, I really enjoyed the shrimp, sauce, and slaw all together. Short Rib Buns. Order comes with two. The short rib is good, if a little salty. Dish comes together nicely with a fresh mango slaw on top. (Lots of slaws here...ever write a word so much you start to question if it's a real word and if you're spelling it correctly? Yeah. Slaw.) Just be careful with these because the paper they're served in stuck to the buns, which aided in their disintegration. Music was a loud but cool mix of 2000s alternative rock (I think) - just imagine lots of The Killers. Two servers were working together, the aforementioned Pablo and a very nice girl named Caitlin. (""Girl"" seems diminutive, but ""lady"" seems aging. Le sigh.) Caitlin was super excited about all the cocktails and did a great job of explaining them and aiding in our decisions. I hope to see her behind the bar soon! When we were done, I kindof elbowed my way up to the bar. Giuseppe looked up quickly and said, ""I'll be right with you!"" ""Oh that's okay, I just wanted to say thank you."" His face lit up, and I could see his pride and excitement pouring through with his ear to ear smile. Finally, super cool: the two lions on the logo are Patience and Fortitude, from the NYPL main branch. Apparently when Giuseppe was a kid during NYC's dark days, he wasn't allowed to go anywhere after school except the library. Swoon. TL;DR - get here soon so you can say you went before it was famous.

I get somewhat complacent in my class grove with my classpass routine so I love when people recommend a new place. Admittedly, I haven't ventured up to Harlem for anything besides Dinosaur BBQ, but this was worth the trip and I was down for an exploration. It is conveniently located right by the 2/3 so if coming up from midtown or UWS it is pretty easy. Seriously, don't be lazy, explore your city. .The studio reminds me of a former beauty salon or barbershop ... just without the mirrors and salon chairs everywhere. You will see what I mean. You walk downstairs into a reception area where an extremely friendly front desk girl checks you in. From there you walk into the spin room where there are cubbies for your things as well as bathrooms in the back to change. The bikes are all brand new. They have baskets for those wearing sneakers and clips for any pros with their SPD shoes.  I love that they have the monitors on them so I can think in terms of RPM while I spin. It makes for a much more efficient workout. Harder to slack off. Your bike comes prepared with water and a towel for you. I love that personal touch. The studio is also extremely clean. I understand you are there to sweat but the last thing I want it to grip onto a bike and have to worry about the sweat residue of the person before you. You won't have that worry here at all. The class I took was a reggae themed ride. What is that you may ask? Well you are spinning out to reggae music. Do I know much about reggae? No, but who cares, it was dope. If you are new to spin, that's totally cool, this place is probably perfect for you. I love themed rides and reggae made for great spin music due to its controlled nature. Specifically it was awesome for climbing. The instructor did a great job of getting new riders set up and comfortable on their bikes before walking them through the different hand positions. With no mirrors it is a judgement free zone in here. You focus on yourself, the music, and the spinning. It was a tough class, but definitely a good kind of tough. I walked out of there with some happy jello legs. It felt great.After class the owner Tameca, greeted everyone with a nice little surprise of bananas, energy bars, and coconut water.

This place serves all sorts of baked goods and sweets from truffles to canelle to petit fours. They also sell gelato by il laboratorio del gelato. However, the piece de resistance - the roll cakes in multiple flavors and the chiffon donuts. So many things, so little room in my stomach.I had bites of my friend's roll cakes and oh my goodness gracious I was wishing I had gotten those. The jasmine green tea is different because it actually tastes like jasmine tea, not just the normal hardly flavored matcha flavor. The salted caramel is the perfect marriage of salty and sweet. The cream for both are not too sweet, a very fresh milky flavor, and filled with vanilla beans which are my favorite! I will most definitely have every single flavor of these the next time I stop by this dessert shop.For myself, I ordered the Jasmine Green Tea chiffon donut, which was unique... kind of. It's nothing like a donut at all, really... more like an Asian pound cake. It tastes like the honey cakes you can get at the Asian supermarket and is a little moist with some sort of honey or sugary sap. The green tea flavor isn't as pronounced in this cake, but it's still very delicious though sweeter than the roll cakes. The white chocolate on top makes the ""donut"" a little hard to eat since its hard on top, but nevertheless it's a great dessert. I just prefer the outstanding roll cakes more.Not much seating inside, so I'd suggest this as a take out dessert place.

My grandfather knew someone who knew people that could get a table, and as a birthday gift brought my family to dine there.The first thing I was taken aback by was that a waiter came out and started asking what we wanted to eat and spouted Italian options that ran the gamut from seafood salad with lobster, shrimp, crab, and calamari to all sorts of pastas, veal, chicken, meatballs, sausage, clams, a basil and breadcrumb coated fried mozzarella and paired with a simple tomato sauce to create a ""caprese"" and other dishes I did not recognize or forgot in the deluge of options. They did this in a way that was very charming. Although it was overwhelming to have these options thrown at you rapid fire, it made you feel like they wanted to get to know you as a diner and prepare the meal specifically for you. As we were a party of 7, the spread that they eventually presented was incredible and had all of the above mentioned items.All of these things were cooked beautifully and you could taste the time and energy that painstakingly went into producing every slow simmered sauce and accompanying item, and the proteins were all succulent. As someone who is fairly well-versed on food, but certainly not an expert on all available Italian dishes, I would say that if you're open to a wide variety of options to ask what the waiter recommends, or ask other diners what they've enjoyed (if you feel so audacious), as I guarantee it will be unique, made to order, and absolutely delicious.If you can get a table here cancel any other plans you may have had, this is an experience that simply cannot be replicated elsewhere.",43,0.9588

They also had some food on the menu, which I did want to try but because we just ate I just wasn't going to be able to fit much more into my stomach -- it came down to deciding between more food or alcohol ....... I chose alcohol =X.For me, this place is really just great. Great location, great ambiance, great service, great drinks, great quality all around.

So waiting almost an hour was a little frustrating. When I walked in I was handed one of those buzzers like the ones from shake shack to let me know when there was a table available. There were two chairs available at the bar, so my friend and I had a couple drinks while we waited. The bar tenders were really nice. We almost ordered food at the bar but our buzzer went off so we went upstairs where the seating is. Every table was taken. So we sat down and went over the menu and I wanted to order almost everything. However, I already knew I had to order the pork belly sliders. They were amazing. We also had the chicken pot pie... Also really good. I forgot what else we ordered but everything was above average. I was so hungry and excited about the food I didn't take pictures.Also, their cocktail list is extensive and unique. Other than the long wait and crammed seating, this place should appeal to almost anyone",41,0.9799

Meat eaters welcome, fish lovers too. Delicious but limited options for vegans or vegetarians. This is one of those restaurants you could come to regularly without getting bored of the menu. An appetizer and a main and not be overwhelming the portion sizes are just right. There are both light and hearty options available. Loved the octopus, beet salad, hamachi tartare, rabbit pappardelle, pork chop, chicken... the list goes on. Have yet to have a bad dish here everything has been delicious.

Fresh was not at all like that! Sabrina was friendly from the moment I walked in the door and fun to talk to - in addition, the other girls in the salon were all striking up conversation as well. THAT is how a nail salon should be!I came in with a photo of Mardi Gras inspired nails and asked Sabrina if she could do it. Together we picked out colors and discussed how to execute the design and she made it come out even better than the photo! I have never gotten glitter on my nails but I am absolutely OBSESSED and will be getting glittery nails every 2 weeks now!I came in for the $38 mani + massage combo (but of course paid more for the designs), and the massage was great.I can't wait to come back in a couple weeks for my next fun nail design.

595,40,25,5.0,"The easy review is to say, ""If you loved the Chapelle Show, you'll love 3 Mics!"" But it's deeper than that. The hip-hop that greets you as you enter the theater makes me wish they had cocktail service at the Lynn Redgrave. The vibe is definitely comedy club lounge. But again, it's more than that. The titular mics and stools are it as far as staging. Sorry. I've been dying for an excuse to use ""titular"" in a sentence for a week now. The third mic gets a great workout. Neal Brennan delivers solid, straight up comedy club material. Wicked funny, with a cross cultural sensibility that only a white guy who wrote shoulder to shoulder with Dave Chapelle can bring. The first mic... not so much. The bits are very funny, don't get me wrong, but it seems a bit tacked on because calling it ""2 Mics"" just doesn't have the proper symmetry. I was all about the 2nd Mic though. Brennan got all up in my feelings. We are close in age and creepily close in life experiences. No, I'm not a successful comedian, writer, producer, director. But when he described his experiences with depression and an emotionally unavailable parent.... Bam. And yes, dude. Henry Rollins is a piece of shit. I'm currently Benjamin Buttoning my way through life as well, just not nearly on Brennan's level. So to the 28 year-old guy in the audience who said he felt old... Yeah, just wait. Your midlife crisis is going to be spectacular! This is one of the better shows I've ever seen. The best one-man show by far. These types of shows live or die on their pacing and the writing.

It's a bagel cut in half covered with very good avocado with a warmed tomato slice on each half each topped with a poached egg. fantastic!I got the fish tacos, made with large pieces of black cod.

I was at the spa next door and I was looking up places to get something quick, and I don't know why I chose to walk in here because I have been working out so hard and eating so healthy and I will probably gain 50 million pounds after this place.Cute, charming, and small...a simple menu, designed to make it easy to order, which of course you can still make your own sammy, but I chose to order from their array. If you don't like proscuitto, then I hate you. I mean, don't come here. Most of their sandwiches consists of it. If you don't like mozzarella or burrata, then you need to die. I meant, don't come here. They make their own and it's simple and fresh, and added to a lot of their menu items. Anyways, their proscuitto was sliced like tissue thin, not paper thin, but thinner! So light, not too salty, probably the best proscuitto I can think of. I got it on a baguette, with the burrata, dripping out of the sides, ooey and gooey, with just some tomato and arugula (mainly for color? jk). I devoured it. I didn't even give it a chance to look pretty, and I still regret giving a piece to my friend who said ""that's f*cking retarded"" because that's how good it was. I really still am bitter about it.And the service was nice, both pretty ladies genuinely smiling. Oh and you get a free drink with your order, and also the prices are way off online!!

599,49,29,5.0,"I've never wanted a place to stay a secret this much. I'd be doing a huge disservice to Dinnertable/the world if I didn't report on my sublime experience here, but in a few weeks time this place is is going to be utterly impossible to get into. So man, am I glad I got here this early in the game. I've had a number of fantastic meals in my life, but my experience here was just special.First things first: Dinnertable is what they call a ""reverse speakeasy"". It may be the only place of its kind in the city. Nestled behind a curtain and a fun little door, your only way to this teeny tiny space (15-20 seats max w/ one communal tables and a few smaller tables around the perimeter) is by navigating through the Garret East--which is a pseudo-speakeasy itself. Though I'm not head-over-heels in love with the Garret, it's a damn good place to get a drink while you wait for dinner. And regardless of how good their drinks are, their profits are going to quadruple/quintuple/and beyond thanks to Dinnertable and the waits that will ensue (though according to the friend I went here with, they're all part of the same ownership group, so it's one in the same).One more note: for fans of Quality Italian, Dinnertable is brought to you by the same husband-wife team. Even better, you can watch them work! Not only is this one of the tiniest restaurants I've ever been to, but there's also no kitchen here. Or no separate kitchen, at least. Behind the ""bar"", the dynamic duo is working away--and are very social while doing so. Like I said, my experience here was its own kind of special. Before I go right into the magical wonderland that is the food here, I will warn you about time. When I arrived at 8pm (on a Friday night), there was no wait here. I was floored. Well, my friend showed up about five minutes later and we made what would ultimately be a very dumb decision, that being to have one drink at the Garret before heading into Dinnertable. 20 minutes later, we were slapped across our proverbial faces with a 40 minute wait. Serious ouch. But we weren't going to miss this. Given that Dinnertable is a small plates venue, we shared everything. 4 plates, 2 drinks, $80. It felt like a total steal. The major redundancy of the night: FLAVOR.Eggplant carpaccio w/ Farro, Spicy Peanuts, Mint: AIdeal dish to start off with. Though I'd said this was my ""least favorite"", citing the world ""relative"" has never been more important. This plate was fantastic...the rest were just more fantastic. The preparation was light yet rich, the peanuts added a lovely crunch to what would have otherwise been a soft texture profile and the farro added a good dose of heartiness.Smoked Short Rib Tartare w/ Horseradish, Marble Rye: A+Any variation of beef tartare paired with horseradish is going to get rave reviews from me. A combination for the ages. This plate nearly made me cry, because I wanted this dish x4 and we only got it, well, x1. Unbelievably flavorful, smoky, rich, subtly spicy. And all atop a perfectly-toasted piece of bread.Baked Mussels w/ Pepperoni Rice: A++What a brililant, creative preparation. I've had some pretty unique mussels preparations due to my mussels obsession, but nothing quite like this. Some might say the fact that these are ""baked"" takes away from the flavor of the mussels, but I didn't mind one bit. More on that flavor--you get pretty much everything here. Briny, salty, some spice--incredibly well-rounded. The picture doesn't do these justice. THE Dumplings w/ potato & pecorino: A++++ to infinity and beyondThese are called ""The Dumplings"" for a reason. The pomp is so warranted, I assure you. This is coming from someone who never eats this particular type of food. These are buttery and creamy and carb-y in all the right/wrong ways, depending on who you are. Though they're not posted online, Dinnertable offers a few cocktails of their own as well. Pictured is the bourbon/chile/strawberry/mint concoction, which was honestly better than most of the drinks I've had at the Garret. I'm a whiskey girl and a huge fan of anything spicy, so this was--and is--my ideal drink.",54,0.9987

601,43,15,5.0,"To those who have yet to experience the joy that is raclette, I ask you this. Why the hell not?To put it simply, raclette is freshly melted cheese poured over some potatoes, cornichon pickles, and cured meats. It may not sound delicious in words, but trust me on this, you have to try it first. Raclette is the size of a broom closet (only a slight exaggeration), seating around 12 people only, but the size of the cheese wheels and the hospitality of the servers is not to be underestimated. Orders of the raclette come with a ""refill"" of cheese which the server pours straight onto your plate from the hot cheese wheel which sits under heat lamps in between servings. Each time the server comes around with the wheel you can't help but stare and admire the chemistry that went into putting this yellow gooey deliciousness on your plate.Here is my recommendation for diners at Raclette: make a reservation (did I mention this place is small?), grab up to seven friends, bring a couple bottles of wine, and simply enjoy.",43,0.9698
602,32,15,5.0,"LOVE. UWS speakeasy, a gem, with fantastic old school ambiance, outstanding service and the best custom cocktails. We were led up a back stairwell from Burke and Wills, the Australian restaurant downstairs, an added bonus of dining there, very cool. Otherwise there's another entrance. Ambiance: Old school class, cricket club inspired, comfortable leather sofas and chairs, dark wood, bookshelves with old books that if you take a close peek have the vintage feel and smell. Somewhat dimly lit with small candles on the table.Not crowded, and seating is wonderfully arranged in personal cozy sections so whether a couple or group you will feel you have your own semi private seating area. Service: outstanding. Our server April had a tasteful 1920-ish period look with her hair and attire . She was incredible, attending to the tables with confidence and a serving style that showed enthusiasm of a new employee but knowledge and confidence of an experienced server. Assessing what each person liked to get their best drinks. Witty, friendly, attentive and so on with her recommendations.Recommended thee perfect heavenly drink creation I can't wait to have again. I was asking about their drinks, a list of interesting cocktails with creative and amusing names, but not sure what to get... She asked about my likes: I said I love Mezcel and I love chocolate : bam, she said I have the perfect drink for you with both . Hmm, interesting . Wow wow . Chocolate and Mezcel heaven with the mixologists' addition of some Mexican spices; apparently they have herbs and spices selected and changed regularly for the mixologists.Huge five stars for the amazing service - server and and mixologist (Jason I believe was the name she gave working at the bar last night) for the perfect custom and off the menu cocktails we had as well as above and beyond outstanding service.

603,33,11,5.0,"My girlfriends and I (a long overdue reunion) decided on this centrally located restaurant (2 blocks from the 72nd St. 1,2,3 stop). I am not normally in this part of town as I work and live below 14th St., but this place was excellent! Cozy ambiance, helpful waitstaff, and delicious healthy Mediterranean food. We also used a Groupon here ($27 for two people which included 2 beer or wine, 1 appetizer, and 2 entrees). I ordered a Brooklyn dark lager ($6) and my friend had the white wine sangria ($6), she said the sangria was tasty. One of my friends and I shared a cauliflower ($5.50) mezze (which basically means tapa or appetizer for Groupon purposes). The cauliflower was one big hunk, not exactly what we were both expecting. It was decent, but I would not get this the next time around. I would suggest the eggplant or falafel or another more traditional Mediterranean mezze. For entrees, I had the veggie patties platter served w/ lentils and rice ($15) and my friend ordered the shakshuka minus the optional halumi or feta cheese ($12). Both of our entrees were a good size. My dish was excellent and the veggie patties were so flavorful (didn't need any of the accompanied sauces) but the waiter was nice enough to give me both the tomato and tzatziki sauce on the side to try. I was pretty hungry as I hadn't eaten much all day and biked from LES to this location, so I polished off my dish and was very satiated. My friend finished half her entree and took the rest home. Our friends got a combo of mezzes (3 for $15) and a small Mediterranean pizza ($7). They both said their meal was tasty and satisfying.For dessert, they were out of the vegan carrot cake, bummer. We then decided on baklava ($7) and malabi ($5). Baklava were three wee small pieces (very adorable presentation), but the flavor was a bit lacking, I would pass on this dessert. Our friends that had the malabi enjoyed it quite a bit, so I would recommend ordering that if dairy is OK with you. And with the Groupon, plus the dessert, taxes, and tip (should tip the waiter off the original food price), we ended up paying $47 in total. Not a bad deal really. This is a conveniently located pro-veggie Mediterranean style restaurant with a cozy and welcoming atmosphere (tucked in a lower level). Service was good and food was solid. I don't think you really save that much with the Groupon, but it's an option. I definitely will be back and will also visit the West Village location.",29,0.9986

We've been here 4 or 5 times now and every time it's a solid experience. Some of my favorite drinks here are the classic sazerac and pin up girl, they're a must try. I would describe their food as good 'ol cajun cooking with an upscale twist. In other words its damn good hearty food with a kick. My ultimate favorite is their roast beef po' boy, it's soooo flavorful it will leave you wanting more. Their fried chicken is cooked to perfection! It's moist and crispy and they give you dark meat! Also their braised collards are the best I've ever had you got to get them.Everything I've ever ordered here wether it was a cocktail or a meal I've loved.

Food choices around this area leaves one to be lack lustered, yes there are enough food chains or carts around the area, those who need not be named TGIF I'm looking at you. The layout of this upscale food court is easily navigable, after all if your on a lunch break you'd want to be in and out as fast as possible #whatshesaid. The space is brightly lit, with modern décor of cafeteria style dining. Thus this is easily a great location to bring a group of friends and sample different foods from each vendor. By sample, I mean eat till your stomach's content. They have numerous restaurants, including coffee/bar in the back, the most notable being the Cinnamon Snail. Frankly it's what brought me to the Pennsy in the first place. The staff could not be any better, from the greeters who actually seem to care, to the bussers who are consistently on the job keeping the space tidy. PS The Cinnamon Snail is a beast on it's own, although their menu has seen a downgrade, it stills hold a prominent place in my vegan heart. After all the food here is nothing short of exceptional. The beast mode burger made it to the new menu and is still one of my favorites (mac & cheese, coconut bacon, and seitan patty on a pretzel bun who could ask for more).PSS I think my boo might kill me when he finds out I got the beast mode burger without him hahah I'm sure the maple bacon donut will make up for it, yep lol",35,0.968
606,41,30,5.0,"It's tough to get tickets (I got mine because of a great standby ticket number), but if you get in, it's fantastic.Online - you have to have your device ready to select the tickets at the exact time he announces on Twitter.

While I feel it is a touristy destination, it is also well regarded with the locals. The ambiance is sexy, and the size makes it great for groups, and cocktails are good. I had the Truce (cucumber/gin based- very, refreshing).  I came here for a pre fixe dinner for a friend's birthday party of 15 or so, and we had SO much food so they were generous. Service was overall good- decent with water refllls but there was a big lag between the apps and the mains.. I guess it's a big group so Idk. But anyway, the food was for the most part, very excellent. (Better than Tao for sure)To start, we all shared the below family style:Cantonese Spring Rolls - Good, but you know hard to mess this up, fried spring rolls. The chicken vs. shrimp was sort of indisguinishableEdamame Dumplings - As good as people say, really unique, it's like edamame plus some kind of mash which made them so flavorful ad uniquePork Potstickers- Meh, sad I wasted calories on eating two of these. With two different dip sauces.Peking Duck Salad - This was ok to good, duck was a bit tough. The greens and poached egg were good.Chili Rock Shrimp - Who doesn't love shrimp tempura? Their is pretty good- not overly saucy or done, perfectly crispy. For the mains, we had:Chilled Udon Noodles- I think they brought this because it was vegetarian but these were not my fave by any means, kind of lacking in flavor.. they have better options. Also had a weird sorbet on top.Lobster Fried Rice- very good. Could use more lobster flavor but overall, very buttery, good fried rice. Kind of had a Thai twang to itChinese sauteed broccoli - such an underrated dish as a side but it was really, really tasty - loved the toasted/fried garlic atopBlack Pepper Beef- Unfortunately did not love this, it was a bit overcooked in my opinion so the beef was rubbery. It was also too saucy...Sizzling Short Rib- very good, well done maybe a bit chewy? But I enjoyed it Salt & Pepper Bass - very very delicious; I loved, loved this- it was well cooked, delicious I think we had the Black Dragon Chicken - crispy, chicken, I think tea smoked? Anyway not sure which it was but it was a well seared, crispy chicken. The mains were definitely mostly better than the starters- except the edamame dumpling. Dessert was banging, and some were just as good as the mains. We had the famous Crying Chocolate- a molten lava cake not to be missed with really good coffee ice cream (which normally I do not like!) The almond bread pudding - not my cup of team; too sweet. The pear sorbet - eh, uninteresting but I guess good if you want something fruity and light. We all had champagne to end the night - a nice toast. Any way, long story short...Buddakan rules, I don't care what people say!! Go here and make it a special occasion.",33,0.9987

Cold-Pressed, unpasteurized, 100% non-GMO ingredients that are pressed, mixed, and bottled in their New Jersey factory, then shipped sameday to their storefront every morning. Be advised, these 16 fl oz juice bottle will not keep for more than 3 days, but after first taste, you will certainly guzzle this down in 3 seconds!The juices are a smart blend of greens, roots, citrus, nuts, fruits, or all 5 together so even those who can't stand the taste of certain green and/or root juices will be amazed. There are so many options available which can usually be overwhelming, however they are well organized and you will be guaranteed to leave with something you like. With friendly helpful staff, they will take you through a journey of all the different tastes and fan favorites as you can sample any and all their juices. They even offer a premade juice cleanse package that comes with 6 different juices (greens, citrus, root, protein, everything) in each of their 3 options (Cleanse 1 for the first timer, Cleanse 2 our most popular, Cleanse 3 for the experienced).I tried juices in each of the major categories with my notes as follows: My first try was Citrus #3 and I immediately fell in love! A refreshing mix of grapefruit and a hint of mint will remind you of a lovely warm summer afternoon sitting by a lake. Next was the Greens #3, which is exactly the same as Greens #2 plus a hint of ginger. This mix is a bit much if you're not used to the slow ginger burn down your throat. At the same time it has all the health benefits of those highly antioxidant greens: kale, spinach, and romaine; sweetness of apple, undertone bursts from: celery, cucumber, and parsley, with a twist of lemon and ginger. You will easily get used to this mix and crave more.Then the Roots #1 which is under the ""low sugar"" icon: the key is the beet juice, which is a great add for health. It is by the far the most nutritious of the root selections. Finally I got a shot of their Signature Blend of Brazil Nut. The kale, spinach, romaine, brazil nuts, vanilla bean, dates, and sea salt blended together to make a rich, thicker juice that tasted more like a smoothy.The bottom line, you should definitely check this place out if you're nearby! Sample to your heart's desire. I'm going back to try their seasonal blends hearing raving review from others at this soft opening.",28,0.9977

I order from them pretty often because I work in Soho and regardless if I do pickup or delivery via GrubHub I always receive it on time and food is always correct. When I say always, I mean always. The food always taste fresh and well seasoned. Lunch time is definitely their busiest time of the day and along with late nights as well.My favorite food at this fine establishment:- Chicken Tortilla Soup- Any of the tacos- Chicken sandwichPick any of those three and you will be a believer and lover of La Esquina. During the spring and summer they have outside seating if you are lucky and there is seating inside but it is extremely limited. If you come during lunch without calling ahead you will be waiting a good 15-30 minutes to get food. BUT TRUST ME IT IS WELL WORTH THE WAIT.I have been to the lounge downstairs twice and I have thoroughly enjoyed myself on both occasions. It is rumored that is one of Beyonce's favorite spots. The menu is alot larger then they have upstairs. The corn is to die for! The selection of Mezcals and Tequilas is out of this world! STOP READING THIS REVIEW AND JUST GO!!! You will thank me later!",32,0.9846
614,32,16,5.0,"When you are craving pizza in the big, bad city, and don't want to brave the black ice and the crowded trains (winter coats add volume to the commuting population) to take you to Di Fara in faraway Brooklyn, you will find a contemporary pizzeria in Marta in the Madison Square Park area.Marta boasts of Danny Meyer pedigree and is an ""ecosystem"" that also includes the Martha Washington Hotel and a sizeable bar, that doubles up as a waiting area for the restaurant. Just the other day, I went with a good friend and former colleague who lives in the area. And the experience was flawless.High ceilings, a communal feel, great service and especially good crackly-crusted pizza. What more can you ask for? The mezzanine area lent itself to quiet conversation. We discussed work, gossiped about common friends, plotted a few clever moves, and then agreed to catch up again soon. I consumed a pizza and a half, and most of the ricotta-hazelnut appetizer.I will return to Marta soon. Not so much to experience the diversity of the menu, as to simply indulge in what I like most--great thin-crust pizza. Hopefully I will have equally delightful company for my future trips!",33,0.9682

616,35,16,5.0,"We often say love cannot last forever and yet, what is forever to us? There isn't a single aspect of our lives that exists in perpetuity, not ourselves, not our homes, not even the art we create, which will likely disappear long before the sun swallows the earth.I personally think it isn't the great cathedrals or statues or gods that are eternal for us; rather it is the most fleeting things: that kiss you will always remember, the look on your son's face you think of every day, an accident you wish you could change.It is these infinitely small, transient things that are the true monuments of life. That stay with us always. So, if you are sitting here with someone you care about, sipping an espresso for a few minutes, know that you are making a greater and more true history than anything read in any book. And honestly, the espresso pulled here, which is some of the best on the UWS, is well worth making these kinds of moments. I often think how sad and sorry a thing like a government, or even an entire city is, compared to two people sitting in the corner of some coffee shop sharing the briefest of kisses.",31,0.9821

618,28,12,5.0,"It's a rarity to find a lunch spot in Midtown where you can actually eat fresh and healthy food. If healthy and delicious is what you're looking for, then you should check this place out - but don't come here too often because I don't want to stand in a long line ;)I think the name ""Between the Bread"" is an oxymoron because most of their menu focuse on salads and bowls and not sandwiches. You choose your protein and then pick two sides. The proteins include grilled or herb-grilled chicken, salmon, catch of the day or shrimp. The salmon looked great, but on this particular day I chose the catch of the day, which was a beautifully cooked white fish. Sides include roasted pumpkin, brussels sprouts, fire roasted cauliflower, beet salad and kale. Grains include wild rice, couscous or quinoa. I went with the kale and beet salad. Both were delicious and healthy. Portions are not too large, but just enough. Prices are not bad either, I'd happily pay more to eat healthy everyday. Very little seating here, so most likely you'll have to do take out.",34,0.9877
619,29,11,5.0,"Overall, an outstanding dining experience.I wanted to do something special for the lady to celebrate the holidays. We have dined at many upscale restaurants in NYC and Per Se was next on my list. I called the reservationist two months in advance to ensure a table at a reasonable hour given the restaurant's longstanding reputation and high accolades. You are required to provide a credit card to secure a reservation, and their cancellation fee is $175 per guest if you do not notify the restaurant within 3 days of your reservation date. They also enforce a dress code, which requires jackets, long pants (no jeans), and no tennis shoes for men and no shorts or tennis shoes for women. We dined at the restaurant last night, and I wore a suit while my girlfriend wore a dress - we were not overdressed.The restaurant was elegant. Walk through the large blue doors on the fourth floor of the Time Warner Center to find the hosts and a classy salon. We were greeted promptly and escorted to the dining room, which was beautiful. The décor and table arrangements were upscale, and the room featured a fireplace and unobstructed views of Columbus Circle and Central Park.The service was excellent. All of our servers were approachable. We appreciated their willingness to accommodate any of our requests. They were extremely knowledgeable of the menus, and they even took the time to get to know us on a more personal level. The presentation of our drinks and food courses was professional.The drinks were great. The restaurant's wine, cocktail, alcoholic, and non-alcoholic menu is roughly 155 pages. They also allow guests to bring wines that are not represented on their list for a fee of $150 per bottle. My girlfriend ordered their version of a gin & tonic, which she found to be refreshing. I started with a ""blood and sand,"" including a mixture of Johnnie Walker Blue, Cherry Heering, and Carpano Sweet Vermouth, which was very tasteful. I capped the meal with a single malt scotch, which was a 30-year Glenrothes from The MacPhail's Collection. This was served with a small and single cube thanks to the recommendation from our waiter, and it was outstanding.The food was delicious. They offer two daily menus, which are a vegetable tasting menu and the chef's tasting menu. We both ordered the chef's tasting menu without any supplements. This included two starter courses, seven menu courses, and an assortment of desserts. We enjoyed every course with the oysters and pearls, fillet of Mediterranean lubina, Maine sea scallop, and Pekin duck breast as some of our favorites. Another notable course was the beef short rib, which was braised for 48 hours. Their description of, ""an assortment of desserts"" is an understatement. We were served at least four different desserts, including a box of truffles that were made onsite, which my girlfriend's sweet tooth thoroughly appreciated.We had a great time and concurred that this was one of our more enjoyable fine dining experiences. We look forward to coming back again soon!",47,0.9968

621,36,22,5.0,"The Quick: From start to finish, a five star, very expensive and noteworthy, experience. The service is amazing, the atmosphere is casual and inviting, and the sushi with sake pairing is what dreams are made of.The Details: I wish I could afford sushi Nakazawa regularly, because I fear I am ruined for all other sushi. The food was out of this world. It's roughly 20 courses with all different types of fish hand curated perfectly for consumption. Even the homemade pickled ginger it was delicious. No soy sauce or extra wasabi needed. The meal really was an experience, interacting with the chefs; the whole evening was sort of like a show. You MUST sit at the sushi bar or it's not worth the expense. Note the staff is extremely fancy but patrons can wear jeans, it's a nice mix. Pro Tip: If you're a couple, I recommend 2 people splitting the sake pairing. The pours were very generous, and one person would likely leave wasted (if that's your goal, by all means live your life). The Damage: $150/ person for omakase, with the sake pairing the bill was ~$400 before tip. And we already want to go back!",35,0.9082
622,37,29,5.0,"Some friends and I recently went to have a wonderful feast on a Thursday evening. At about 7:30 on a cold night right off a cobble stone street in the Meatpacking District I arrived to a warm welcome at Bagatelle. Before I even reached the bar to wait for the rest of my party to arrive I encountered five different employees, all greeting me with huge beautiful bright smiles.The restaurant that happened to be the setting for our evening was what might be considered the birth child of when classy got with hip. Or perhaps a better description, it was the result of when a bunch of undercover hip people, including the staff, showed up at a classy restaurant. This all became very evident, reaching the point of being unmistakable, as soon as I laid eyes on the cool suggestive artwork donned by the walls. Then again, the restaurant might have described itself best, ""...the chic St. Tropez meets Paris."" This place is legendary for its epic party-like brunches, but now can also be touted for its great food with the masterpieces from Chef Sébastien.Once my entire party of 7 arrived we commenced with our communal style meal with appetizers and wine at about 8 pm. We started with salad, grilled octopus, homemade gnocchi, black truffle pizza, ahi tuna tartar, king crab leg, and main diver scallops. Like myself, the entire group enjoyed everything, but I also had a few personal favorites of my own.Grilled Octopus, aka Poulpe Grillé à la Plancha(white bean hummus, crispy Yukon gold, Kalamata olives aioli)...was juicy, tender and flavorful. Suddenly I don't know if I can ever look at Ursula off the Little Mermaid the same way again. Where you may see evil, I see potential, a lot of delicious potential. Whoever thought octopus could taste this good?Homemade Gnocchi, aka Gnocchi Truffés à la Parisienne de Nicolas(black truffle pesto filling, truffle sauce)...was perfectly cooked with an excellent texture and by far the best I have ever had. Thought to originate in the Middle East, whomever first created gnocchi would be very pleased with what has come of it, at least the gnocchi I had.Black Truffle Pizza, aka Pizza à la Truffle Noire(black truffle, flat bread, crème fraiche, scamoza)...was extremely flavorful, decadent in a good way, but also well balanced. To even call something that taste so unique, but still so good 'pizza' seems blasphemous. Yeah, I was lucky enough to have two slices due to everyone else's efforts to King Crab Leg, aka Ceviche de Crabe d'Alaska(king crab leg, habanero & citrus ""leche de tigre"", smoked trout roe)...was remarkable as the sweet flavors of crab danced with acidic citrus and lightly spicy habanero. This was a threesome I am fully willing to stand behind anytime if it looks like this.After our light and not so light apps the more hearty heavy hitters came out. We had whole-truffle chicken, center cut beef tenderloin, and pan seared marinated Hudson Valley duck breast. Of the three I enjoyed the Châteaubriand - Pour Deux best (24 oz center cut beef tenderloin, truffle potato purée, red wine and peppercorn sauce - for two). The truffle potato purée might have been the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. They were thick and richly flavorful. Not really sure what else I should say about them. I will just add this though. Immediately I formed a gripe towards every other establishment I've ever had truffle anything from. Every single thing Chef Sébastien put truffles in or on that we ate was simple amazing. Hell, I didn't even think I cared that much for truffles before Bagatelle. Up until this point I've been cheated of great truffle experiences and someone owes me answers!Next came the desserts. We had Italian meringue crisp, white chocolate tart, dark chocolate mousse, and caramelized hazelnut mini choux puff....drops spoon!!!! The Chouchou Caramel though! Wow! ...caramelized hazelnut mini choux puff and milk chocolate caramel sauce, was incredible! On your visit you should tell your server Sheldon sent you, then ask for it because it isn't on the menu. Okay, that will most likely increase your chances of getting the Chouchou by 0%, but it sounded good. HaHaCenturies after spices and food from around the world was made available to the rest of the world, a mad scientist figured out how to pair these ingredients together perfectly. Chef Sébastien is an evil genius with a life goal of dooming everyone who is fortunate enough to partake in his delicious creations. He wants to doom us to eternal gluttony! I'm convinced of it and can't wait to partake again.",49,0.9991
623,12,5,5.0,"So, who grew up the Bronx and DIDN'T take a school trip here? Probably no one (okay maybe someone), but odds are if you live in NYC or the surrounding areas you've been here at least once. The Bronx Zoo is deeply intertwined with the history of the borough itself. Opened in 1899, the zoo is owned by the Wildlife Conservation Society. WCS does work all around the world, and they also own/operate four other NYC parks (Central Park Zoo, Queens Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo, and the New York Aquarium). At 265 acres, the Bronx Zoo is the largest park WCS runs and is also the location of their headquarters. There's a lot to see and do, you definitely get your money's worth with the amount of animals you'll see; they have a good representation of most types of wildlife. Some of my favorite exhibits are Jungle World, Congo Gorilla Forest, the sea lion pool, and the Sea Bird Aviary. It's a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes, though they have a shuttle that goes from one side of the zoo to the other (which I believe they charge for). Food options are okay; there are concession stands throughout the park and a large counter service eatery called The Dancing Crane Cafe located in the center of the zoo. For something less run-of-the-mill I would bring my own food/snacks. There's also a large gift shop in the center of the park where you can pick up your Bronx Zoo memorabilia and a stuffed snake. The zoo is pretty accessible - there are four entrances and four parking lots (they charge for parking). Additionally, it's not a far walk from the subways, Metro North, and city buses. Wednesday is suggested donation (aka free) day; though you may be tempted, the crowds are crazy so I would avoid it. Admission isn't exactly cheap, but it's worth it. The Bronx Zoo is definitely a place to visit at least once, definitely makes other zoos pale in comparison.",14,0.9877
624,20,7,5.0,"**Reservation recommended, unless you want to wait 1-2 hours!!**Probably my new favorite place for AYCE hot pot, but the wait here, as with most hot pot places, is absolutely ridiculous. However, if you're like me, and the craving for hot pot is just so real and you called and they already had 0 reservations left, a 1.5 hour (!!!) wait is worth it. Was it worth it? Verdict: yes.After the crazy long wait, we were finally seated at our 4-person table (but we only had 3). You have the choice of having 1 large pot (split into 2 or 3) to share among the table, but we decided to each get our own individual pots instead (free of charge). You can choose from original, herbal, spicy, curry, or tom yum soup bases.Of course, I went with the spicy soup base as I do with all hot pot places. It was just I expected - spicy, but not too bad and actually not ridiculously greasy like some places have it. There were plenty of numbing herbs and whole garlic cloves as well.The ingredients at Hometown seem very fresh, from the watercress to the seafood to the meat. I highly recommend the lamb - it was really good here and I usually don't eat that much meat when I eat hot pot. Watercress is my absolute favorite. No comment on the rest of the ingredients, it's just really what you prefer to eat or not eat - just know that it's fresh.Service is much, much better than that of 99 favor - our waiter was all smiles and really nice. I also liked that there seems to be much more space to move around here and not feel like you're eating in a box with a million other people sitting too close to you. The decor is modern and quite comfortable both upstairs and downstairs.Current ranking of Chinatown hot pot spots:1 Hometown2. 99 Favor3. Hou yiThey charge $13.99 a pound for uneaten food, but I'm not sure it's really enforced.Ventilation is not that great in the downstairs area - beware, you WILL smell after leaving the restaurantGood for groups as they have massive tables downstairs, but definitely make a reservation.",19,0.9955
625,18,6,5.0,"I have a long history with Scarpetta. When I was a young deer in headlights at 18 years old, a little baby fawn in my first year of ever living in Manhattan, I came here for dinner with some friends. There is no sign in front of the restaurant and I completely forgot the name/where this restaurant was. I always did remember it as the best spaghetti I ever had.Fast forward to when I moved to Miami and dined at Scarpetta where this glorious spaghetti again touched my mouth. I instantly remembered the flavors as being from the same restaurant in NYC. I finally realized that it was Scarpetta that I had dined with that lovely evening.Ever since then, I have been to the Scarpetta in LA, Vegas, Miami, and back in NYC. I have never had a negative experience at all in this restaurant, ever. That is pretty hard to pull off! The food is extremely consistent and absolutely delicious.+ Raw yellowtail - Light and refreshing although I wish there was some ponzu sauce or a bit more flavor to it (that's just my opinion, a lot of people like it the more traditional way with less sauces)+++ Chilled corn soup - I was never a fan of cold soup until having this dish at Scarpetta. It changed the game and now I love chilled soups. It has the perfect texture and flavor. It's not too heavy but not too light either. + Scallops - Amazing but you only get 2 so be prepared it is a smaller dish. ++++++++++++ SPAGHETTI +++++++++++++++ TO. DIE. FOR.

626,22,9,5.0,"Dropped in on Ramen Lab last Friday and as you know, they consistently host a cadre of formidable talent from Japan that take up residency at this famed, yet tiny establishment to showcase different styles of ramen. They've got our 4.8/5.0 in the bag and here's why.Quality ramen in the U.S. supplied by Sun Noodles, goes pretty much hand in hand with every great establishment in New York. It's no secret that Ramen Lab would lead the forefront of this charge from when they first opened with Chef Jack Nakamura operating and setting the tone for others to follow.I met up with three others around 7pm, as there's no reservations, you write your name down on a board by the door entrance (within the vestibule). The wait time lasted for no more than a half hour, decent given the time we showed up. If you arrived an hour earlier, there's probably little to no wait at all. Their choices are listed on the wall and there's little in the way of ambiguity of decision-making, which makes order-taking simple, efficient, and straightforward. That part happens when they call your name to enter. It's standing room only, as can be expected, and cash only.This season, Ramen Tetsuya from Sapporo, Japan holds residency, the same Tetsuya Brothers Ramen known to specialize in Shoyu. Oddly, they offered miso tonkotsu here and serve it particularly well. I was not decidedly hungry so I ordered a regular, my friend ordered one with the seasoned egg.The ramen arrived lightning fast (well, within 5 minutes of entering) and we were able to snap photos, yet still have steaming hot ramen awaiting us after ten minutes of photo-snapping obnoxious fun.There were a couple pieces of decent sized chashu sitting above the broth, but the broth is what made the meal, in addition to the nice chew from the ramen noodles. I nearly finished the broth. It was that good! It's no secret that other restaurants may offer an extra side of noodles so you can finish it along with the broth, but that is not an option here.As the staff here were very professional and worked quickly, there were no complaints to be had other than the familiar waiting period and that there were no seats to be found except a couple of makeshift ones outside by the vestibule. Beyond that they've earned their stars. 4.8/5.0",20,0.6044
627,16,7,5.0,"Dinner was absolutely fantastic. Made a reservation for a Thursday night about a week early and had no problem getting a table. I love the ambiance of the place, you can tell it's been around for a long time. The wait staff is extremely nice and attentive. The oysters were delicious and fresh. The steak au poivre was perfection. I got it cooked medium rare and it was spot on. The peppercorn crust and sauce give it an incredible flavor. The spinach and fries that come with it are also delicious. The lamb was tasty and cooked perfectly but could've used a little more flavor. The profiteroles were insane - you have to get these. They look dense but they're light and airy and the chocolate sauce is insane. I found myself eating it straight from the gravy boat.

628,36,23,5.0,"The best thing about having friends visit from out of town is taking them to all of the places I normally wouldn't make it to (er, other than seeing the friends themselves). Levain was at the top of my list, because unlike other New York heavyweights (looking at you, Shake Shack and Momofuku), they haven't felt the need to spawn and spread themselves too thin. Having seen the crazy lines at the 74th location, I decided to chance the Fredrick Douglass one ... and there was a line. Yep. I was stuffed from a winner winner chicken lunch at Pio Pio a few hours before, but after watching my friend wolf down the chocolate chip walnut cookie, I knew I was in for a treat. The cookie was still gooey and chewy even after sitting out on the counter for a few hours - so good, I'd even be willing to try the oatmeal raisin version. Shaped like a scone, a little dome of nuts/chips at the top, a perfectly crunchy ring, and, best of the best, the molten middle. I have to confess, I don't understand most of the food that people go insane for. 3 hours for ramen? Waking up early for a cronut? Paying out of the nose for avocado toast with some chili flakes, feta, and pumpkin seeds? Guilty (and I've been making my own avocado toast since). But this cookie deserves the hype. NEXT TIME: dark chocolate and pb cookie. I love peanut butter in any kind of dessert form, so I'm a little terrified at how gross I will look eating it, but it's a sacrifice that I'm willing to make.",42,0.99
629,32,19,5.0,"Found my new fave dinner spot! Came here for ""mistress Valentine's"" (a joke by the hubby) because we couldn't get a table for actual Valentine's day so we opted for a substitute celebration. Whatever, Valentine's Schmalentines. Hate to ascribe to it. It had been awhile for us in Manhattan where everything from taste, quality, service synced beautifully together to create that perfect dining experience, but it happened here. Service was phenomenal from the minute we stepped into this place til the moment we left. The set menus, plating and ambiance really made us feel like we were truly dining in Japan. Also, was great seeing a lot of Japanese people dining here as well. To me, that is the true mark of awesome Japanese fare.We started with the handmade soba noodles with dipping sauces to start and it was just perfect. Sooo good! I forced the hubby-- okay gently directed him-- to order the kaisen don set, which he didn't really like but that uni, yes it is as sweet and umami-tasting as everyone has described. I would order that separately but that's just me. My katsu toji (katsu fried pork loin in salty sweet soy broth) was definitely the star of the meal. My hubby couldn't keep his chopsticks away from it. With the set, it comes with pickled vegetables (ok), pork and vegetable miso broth (hubby really loves this), steamed egg custard (yummy! Unless you're like my hubs who actually thought he was getting ice cream custard!) and yes, that heaping bowl of rice. There's also the option of ordering soba and add-ons for an extra price which had we known, would've done that instead of getting the soba as a starter. Even though we were both STUFFED midway into our meal, we just had to finish off with dessert. Ordered the strawberry parfait which contained buttermilk (mmmm!!!) and strawberry ice cream with a powdered sugar cone, strawberry sauce and marshmallows (these really kinda took away from it all if you ask me). Paired all this with hot yuzu sake and a pitcher of Sapporo, which we realized was just excessive at this point given how much food they give you! I haven't been able to stop thinking about this place and can't wait to come back again. All in all, a great traditional Japanese spot with options of getting sashimi/sushi, yakitori, dinner sets or churashi. I highly, highly recommend this place!",28,0.9979

631,34,22,5.0,"4.5/4.75. A few small issues, but rounding up because the food and wine were out of this world. Like actually, I'm not sure if these things were created by earthlings. Order 40 of the spicy tuna plates. And maybe 30 of the beef tartares. Okay maybe just come here for dinner every night and deal with the whole going broke thing later. Sound reasoning, no?Came here around 7:30 on a Thursday night. As others have reported, there's going to be a pretty substantial wait if you don't come between 6-6:30 (NO RESERVATIONS). The hostess was incredibly scattered, which was one of the minor issues we experienced during our visit. I'm not sure if she was overwhelmed or what, but there seemed to be no organization whatsoever when it came to seating people efficiently. So while our first impression wasn't good, we were determined to stick it out - thank god we did! The wait ended up being about 45 minutes (they told us 30), but we were rewarded for good behavior, being sat right in front of the kitchen! Some might prefer a table, but my fellow foodie friend and I were thrilled.Just to clarify - when I say foodie, I'm not one of those voracious Times/Eater/Grub Street/Infatuation readers who knows everything about every restaurant opened by ""this team"" or ""that team"" or ""the brainchild of the creators of so and so..."". What I did know going into it was this: I had been wanting to try the tasting menu at Contra for quite some time, and when I heard that Wildair was the more causal - wait for it - BRAINCHILD of the Contra folks, and a la carte to boot, it shot up to the top of my list. First: Wine. I know cocktails very well, beer pretty well, and wine not well at all. So when I'm confronted with a wine list such as the colossal display at Wildair, I get really intimidated. Thankfully, there were plenty of servers around to help guide us in the right direction, and all of them were quite patient with our amateur-ism. I ended up trying two different reds which were both fantastic. We both opted for wine by the glass, so we were able to give our prospective options a taste before deciding. The wine here - along with being overwhelmingly diverse - is natural/organic/biodynamic, so like the food, the feel is very clean and refined. FOOD! The way that everything is listed on the menu, you'd think the food here is oddly minimalist. This is not the case. They list the key players in each dish, but the subtleties are left a mystery. I'm a fan. -Bread and Olive Oil (A)Paying for bread seems silly to me. But they're known for making some standout bread in-house here, and the rumors are true. The only thing silly here would be NOT to order it. Not much more to say - you gotta experience it yourself. -Beef Tartare, Smoked Cheddar, Chestnuts (A+)I don't eat red meat too often but after perusing the Yelp and the Google for a bit before coming here, it seemed pretty unanimous that ordering the beef tartare at Wildair might be the best decision you make all day. Again, the hype was warranted. The texture and flavor profiles of this dish were sublime. The tuna was my favorite dish of the meal, but my inner foodie knows this baby was by far the most inventive and beautifully-executed plate we had. Apparently, beef can be made light and fluffy - thank you Wildair for enlightening me. Just a note - this plate is slightly spicy thanks to the addition of some horseradish. This made the dish for me.-Georgia White Shrimp, Celery, Cilantro (A)You're encouraged to eat the skin. It's not necessary, but it made the dish for me. I wasn't head over heels in love with the shrimp honestly, but it was masterfully prepared, as everything here seems to be. -Spicy Tuna, Scallion, Tomatoes (A+++)Served on toast. Party in your mouth good. I suppose it's not as ""refined"" as some of the other dishes here and certainly not as complex, but the resounding flavor is incredibly powerful. The tomato and tuna blend together in the sweetest of harmonies. Now that's what I call a power couple.-Chocolate Hazelnut Tart (A++) I basically don't eat desserts because consuming food high in sugar does really weird stuff to my chemistry. That said, I caved and had a couple bites of the tart after hearing nothing but squeals of glee from my equally adventurous dining companion. They were warranted, I assure you. The tart looks quite simple. Deceptively simple. I don't know how they make this little piece of heaven taste so damn good (the salt on top doesn't hurt), but whatever they do, they better keep doing it. Sweet, rich, creamy but not too heavy.",52,0.9992

I kid you not, I could have soup 212 days a year, but only with one caveat, there has to be a multitude of varieties and that's what Hale and Hearty provides, a multitude of varieties. Aside from soups, Hale and Hearty offers a choice of pre-made sandwiches, plus an option to create-your-own salad. Eh, for me, I'd rather just have my soup, thank you very much. Thank you Executive Chef Bruce Rogers for bringing your philosophy of 'If you liked it as a kid, you'll like it as a soup.' Basically it seems his thought process is any knife and fork meal could be basically turned into a soup and did so by creating 500 different varieties that are constantly rotating on the menu board.To help you choose there's a dietary breakdown showing either V=Vegetarian, L=Low-Fat or D=Dairy. Plus samples are offered to also narrow down your decision. Samples have helped me expand my favorites to: Curried Eggplant & Lentil, Ginger Butternut Squash, Chicken Pot Pie, Tomato Cheddar...yummm Tomato Cheddar, Lobster Bisque, Vegetarian Split pea, Green & Yellow Split Pea with Smoked Bacon, Morrocan Chicken, and so many more. This location, during lunch hours, can have lines out the door but the employees at the soup counter and the register are good at what they do and get you in and out quick fast and in a hurry. Upon checkout don't forget to get your Green Bean card stamped so you can cash-in on a free soup after a bunch of visits. Soup is good food!",57,0.9939

My favorites are the Banh Mi (braised pulled pork or chicken w / spicy aioli, vinegar slaw, fried shallots & cilantro) sandwich, and the buffalo mac & cheese side! If you're indecisive, you're better off getting two half sandwiches over a full one. You'll pay an extra buck or two overall...not only can you pick out two varieties, but you'll actually end up with something more substantial in size/filling than a full sandwich.",46,0.8973
634,32,18,5.0,"It isn't often you get to say that you had a restaurant experience that was perfect from beginning to end, but my experience at Ocean Prime was one of them. I was meeting a group for a birthday dinner but I arrived early. This allowed me to spend some time at the bar enjoying a couple drinks beforehand. The hostess was immediately welcoming and after a quick coat check I hung out at the bar to enjoy my cocktail. I had the Whiskey Clover, described on the menu as ""Gentleman Jack Whiskey, Hennessy VS, Honey Water,Hand-Squeezed Lemon & Orange"". You'd think with a description like that the drink would've been overly sweet, but instead it was just the right balance of citrus sweetness and whiskey flavor. I really enjoyed it.As I sat at the bar I looked around the bar area which includes several comfortable, circular booths and tall tables. The bar area alone could accommodate a party. The decor manages the hat trick of looking sophisticated but not pretentious. The combination of dark wood, white counters, medium tone furniture and dim lighting creates a comfortable atmosphere that feels rich, but not in an off putting manner. The environment lends itself to everything from after work drinks with colleagues to a date.Eventually my friends began to arrive and we all got to talking - so much so we didn't realize that it was taking a rather long time to get to our table (we had a reservation - I highly recommend you make one). The manager came up to us and was very gracious, offering us the use of the private dining room near the bar area (dubbed the ""Rockefeller Room"") since they had made us wait so long. We of course accepted and happily sat down for a very different experience than we had expected!The Rockefeller Room could easily accommodate a small office party of about 10-12 people. There is a large, round table with a huge lazy susan in the middle. There is a flat screen TV mounted on the wall and tasteful decor is the order of the day in the brightly lit room. Our waiter was absolutely professional and on point the entire night. It wasn't just a matter of making sure our glasses were full of water. His manner and event he way he addressed us spoke volumes about the training the staff had gone through. We were all very impressed.Okay, enough talk about the room and bar etc. What did I eat? Here's a list of what I got to have:FILET MIGNONNot wanting to be a complete glutton, I went with the 8oz filet mignon, medium rare. The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. While you can order items on top of the steak such as black truffle butter, I wanted it straight to taste it in its most pure form. I'm really glad I did. When I cut the meat it was like butter and it was perfectly tender. There was just the right amount of seasoning to make your taste buds happy but not overwhelm them. It was also truly medium rare with pink in the middle.JALAPENO AU GRATINA side dish, this comes in a rather large bowl and there was enough that all six people at the dinner were able to get a couple forkfuls of this spicy dish. Jalapenos generally can go two ways: either there is a kick or there isn't. In this dish there definitely was along with some savory flavor.PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIESOther restaurants have this and I've had it many times. Most of the time they are shoestring fries and there's not a lot of substance to them. Not so here! These fries were *huge* and the cheese layer was obvious from several feet away. These were absolutely addicting. Be warned, you can't just eat a couple!CREAMED SPINACHWhat could have been a typical creamed spinach is elevated by a smokey element inside the dish. Most of us agreed it was likely bacon, but there were no bacon bits to be found. Whatever the case may be, this was a very uncommon creamed spinach that was full of flavor.BLACK TRUFFLE MAC N' CHEESEI only got to have one bite of this, but it was full of flavor. The cheese was creamy and salty and the truffle flavor was definitely assertive. TEN LAYER CARROT CAKEA signature dessert, this cake was *truly* 10 layers. It was a literal tower of goodness. The cake was so moist that you could push a fork through all ten layers and it didn't tip over. It tasted delicious and surprisingly had no raisins in it.CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER PIEPeanut Butter Mousse and Bittersweet Chocolate Ganache come together to make one of the most delicious desserts I've had in ages. The mousse is perfectly delicate but full of flavor while the ganache gives just the right amount of sweetness to balance the savory mousse. Special shout out to the coffee and bread basket - both of which could easily be overlooked in any restaurant, but here they were exceptional. The bread basket had amazing pretzel sticks (fresh baked!) and the coffee was french pressed!I really enjoyed my experience at Ocean Prime and I can't wait to go back!",38,0.9995
635,26,14,5.0,"I thought I should wait a bit to go here, but I wanted to see what all the hype was about. Also my friend lives right down the block, so I figured if we had a long wait we could at least wait there. I went yesterday (Wednesday) and got there around 6:10. The line was to the corner of 22nd and 8th, so not that bad. They opens at 6, so they were seating people slowly and then when they were filled they would take names. Luckily both my friend and I were there and we were seated when we got up to the front. It was probably overall a 20 min wait. The place is a good size. We were seated in the front at one of the low communal tables. There are 6 seats at each of those tables and we were sat in the middle across from each other. It was close, you could hear everyone's conversation around you, but I didn't feel like they were eating right on top of me. The place was noisy though, so it was a little hard to carry on a conversation. The waitress came over and took our drink orders. I just went with a glass of the house white. It was sweeter than I thought it would be, but it was still good. My friend had ordered the limoncello slushi, but they came back and told us it wasn't ready yet, so he went with the blood orange daquiri. We had looked over the food menu and thought about what we had wanted. We also heard a few recommendations from the waitress, and then made our decisions. We decided to go with 5 small plates and no entrée, and it proved to be a good idea. We ordered the sirloin crudo. I've never been a big fan of tartare, or carpaccio (I like my fish raw, not my meat) but my friend wanted to try it and it was a suggested plate to get, so we did. It was pretty good, and I had some, but I let my friend finish it. If you like raw meat, I think you'd like it. We didn't add on truffles to anything because I HATE them, but for an additional price you could add it this and the chicken and dumplings soup. We got the shaved winter vegetables, which are pickeled and served in a beef broth. I liked it, the presentation was pretty and it was light and refreshing. Another one from the appetizer section we got was the tofu. I really liked this one! The tofu was so smooth and creamy! The trout roe on top was really fishy tasting, but I liked it. I finished that one off while my friend finished off the crudo. Win-win! Next up was the ceci e pepe, which was probably one of my favorites. The pasta was so good, and chickpea hozon (whatever that it) was amazing. I'm not a huge black pepper person, but I even enjoyed that on top too. Last up we got the chicken and dumplings. I really liked this as well. My friend wasn't as big of a fan. It was served in a thick broth with chicken, thick noodles and mushrooms (which I did not eat) and had a bit of a spicy kick to it. We thought about dessert, but we were both stuffed, so maybe next time. Overall I really enjoyed Nishi! Everything we ordered was really good. My friend doesn't love fish, so there were a few dishes I'd like to go back another time and try. Service was good, everyone seemed very friendly and attentive - clearing plates and making sure everything was ok. Pricewise I didn't think it was too bad either. For a drink and a satisfying meal it came to about $70 per person (no tipping it's all included), which isn't crazy for a nice meal in NYC. I definitely plan to go back at some point!",33,0.9987
636,31,22,5.0,"Just opened yesterday. Best meatballs that even Beat Bobby Flay's in a meatball throw down / challenge aired on the Food Network; and possibly even more impressive, liked and devoured by my pickiest ever son. :DVery unique concept- Grandma Maroni's meatballs and other Italian dishes/ meals served in a small, medium or large sized cool looking red pot... That you can have delivered or take home with you. The meatballs - wonderful! My very picky and healthy son thinks he wants to be vegan - not ok for a young, growing child ... so I need to use creative negotiation to get him to eat meat or chicken... Zombie tv for protein and iron? Whatever works ... When I walked into this new little restaurant, I was brave ordering takeout/ meatballs for my son... Hm. What tv show should I use... would it work ? My son hated the last meatballs at The Meatball Shop ... So I wasn't sure if he would even try let alone eat them ... Well, huge thumbs up. ""I will try a bite"" even without any bad tv incentive turned into his eating and loving ALL the meatballs . Success and a thank you to Grandma Maroni... Even a want to be vegan can't resist the Maroni meatballs! Amazing Pop's pizza bread which my son couldn't stop smelling and looking at before we ate, amused I think by its ginormous size and unique look. Delicious.Raw salad with arugula and Parmesan also super with a great tasting, light dressing.The decor is really cute with red pots hanging from the walls... A t-shirt hanging inside and sign outside says ""Our pot is legal."" Cute.They have one location in Northport, and brought this one to NYC- a unique concept and fantastic addition to the upper east side!The manager Marizio and employees Jennifer and Mike were really friendly; and Mike's knowledge and pride in the business - wow. I was asking about the business, and he shared all the facts in this post with me.

637,27,14,5.0,"This is by far, one of the best Indian restaurants I've visited, time and time again. They never disappoint, whether we come for the lunch buffet or a la carte. The staff is always pleasant and attentive, the bathrooms are always clean and we've never had a problem getting a table. The lunch buffet has a wonderful selection of various curry dishes, vegetable dishes and tandoori. The price is right at $12 on weekdays (noon-2:30p) and $16 on weekends (noon-3p). They usually have one or two desserts, my favourites being the Halwa (carrot pudding), Gulab Jamun (sweet dumplings) and the Kheer (rice pudding). Every time we visit, we leave full and satisfied. Their Samosas have gotten much better since I last remember. The dough is way lighter so you can actually enjoy the whole thing without becoming overly full. Their Naan is always good; it's soft and warm and I love getting the garlic variety. Every meal comes with Papadum (thin baked bread crisp) and a few condiments of tamarind sauce, onions and a cilantro sauce. I love their curries, both Phaal and Vindaloo are my favourites and I usually pick either Lamb, Goat or Shrimp as my protein. They're extremely spicy but an order of Raita will help cool it down. The Biriyani is top notch, as is their Tandoori Chicken, unbelievably juicy. If you're feeling adventurous, try some of their Hot Pickle condiment which is basically spicy pickled lime. Just writing about it makes my mouth water. I would suggest that you take advantage of their buffet if you haven't visited before so you get the opportunity to try a variety of items. Weekdays are less crowded bit get there early because there tends to be a steady flow of people throughout their lunch rush. Also, make sure to fill out a comment card so that you stay alert with their events and specials.",32,0.9919

640,33,22,5.0,"This place lives up to the hype and Dominique Ansel is a pure genius. The only thing that annoys me is that things like the cronut and the cookie shot are served at certain times but that's probably better for the diabetes epidemic. I had a friend come in for a day and I decided this was the most touristy things to do and I have never been here. The bakery itself is very narrow and long so make sure not to bring something big with you. There were some people that came with suitcases which made it a pain to walk around. In the back there's a beautiful garden and on the way to the garden you can see the employees baking and like 100 sticks of butter. I have never seen so much butter in my life. Since I didn't know the cronut was a morning thing, we ordered the DKA. The DKA was delicious and was perfectly caramelized outer crust and was puffy and layered that bounced back after I bit into it. Loved it. I was kinda mad that I forgot that they sold frozen smores which would have been to cool to get with my friend in town. We then hung around till 3 to get on the cookie shot line. The line wasn't that bad for a Friday. We prob waited like 7 mins max, a few people go in at a time as to not crowd the bakery. OMG the cookie shot. It is pure perfection. We couldn't talk for like 5 mins after and kept rubbing our bellies. It was amazing. The cookie was dense and chewy just the way I like it.

He is rightfully proud that everything is made from scratch, with no lard, animal fats or MSG. There's a page specifically for Vegetarians too. Menu prices are a bit higher than a typical family style Mexican place, but the quality is worth the extra cost.The complimentary chips and spicy salsa were a good start. The nachos with guacamole was delicious. My Carne Asada en Salsa Ranchera came bright, colorful, fresh and tasty with grilled rib-eye, jalapeño, onions and vegetables. We all enjoyed our entrees. The owner gave us a complimentary dessert, delicious Tres Leches with real whipped cream.With a whole page of margarita specials to select from, both frozen and on-the-rocks, it takes awhile to read.

Well, I guess for a place like this; in this particular case my move (however painful - miss you already Brooklyn), paid me back with a few perks. When I first heard that we would be seeing a place next to Central Park, I figured it would be nice (who doesn't love a walk in the park), but nothing overly insane. I mean a park is a park right? Wrong, oh so very wrong of an assumption. Some parks are, well, better than others and the conservatory is amazing. Walking through Vanderbilt gate (a guy actually unlocks this in the morning - I want to see what the key looks like), you find yourself transported to a park hidden inside a park. With flowing fountains and groomed walking paths, the park is sculptured with angles and elevations that are laid out so spectacularly that they make this oasis in Manhattan feel truly grand; this place would do very well in Paris, no doubt about it. The best part of this park for me, is that it takes you out of the craziness of the city to a more tranquil place. You can truly relax here, and forget about your surroundings or the stress of the day. If you've never had a chance to check this place out, and happened to find yourself in the north side of the park, absolutely stop in._____________________________________*Side note; it's good to be back; new lab is up and running, apartment is coming together and I actually have a few minutes to write a review (hurray!)",58,0.9612

And yeah you have to put in some time waiting for your bird, but once it finally comes you will see that it is pretty excellent.Just before being placed into the sandwich the fried chicken is slathered in this spicy vinegary dip that gives it this really unique, tangy flavor. It is also slightly spicier than most chicken sandwiches currently in nyc but not overwhelming. However, the spicy dip also dampens the skin a bit so just be aware of that. But with the pickles, crazy southern mayo, and straight up normcore bun it is a pretty insane sandwich and probably one of the top fried chicken sandwiches in NYC right now.I also found the fried chicken here to be both comically large and quite excellent. I like the shatteringly thin, puffy golden skin as well as the extremely moist meat and ever so slightly spicy taste.

While strained is more similar to your typical Greek yogurt, I prefer the traditional. It has a thin layer of whey on top, and I like that it's less thick, but just as creamy. To me, the traditional has a bit more flavor and is much less tart. If you go with the rose petal preserves, be prepared to try NOTHING ELSE FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIVE. I thought I would be adventurous with the menu each time I walk in, but I've not been able to wean myself off the rose petal preserves. Just do it. It's a magical combination, and best of all, you can buy a jar of the rose petals to add to your own yogurt at home.There are plenty of savory items on the menu. I've had the Greek salad, which is superb. All of their ingredients taste great and look like they belong on a blog. The service is top-notch, and the space is big and comfortable. There's a garden in the back and plenty of seats. Because of the price point, you usually don't find this place packed with tourists like everywhere else in Nolita/SoHo.

I remember when I first ventured into one of their SF shops last year, I knew the east coast could use some boba improvement. 12 months later, I'm happily sipping on their amazing drinks right in the heart of New York.I've pretty much sampled every item on their menu and my all-time favorite is definitely their coffee milk tea. A balanced combination of smokey coffee and fragrant black tea, it's the perfect afternoon drink. Please make it a permanent item on the menu!My other favorites include the jasmine milk tea and the thai milk tea. I hate it when boba shops use too much milk powder because it makes the drink taste chalky. Because Boba Guys uses real milk, it really allows the tea flavors to blossom, making it more refreshing as a whole.Their boba is one of the best kept secrets. Soaking in a mysterious mixture of brown sugar and honey, among other unknown ingredients, it's the perfect QQ consistency. If you're not a fan of firmer balls, be warned that these boba balls will bounce back with every bite (but in the most fun, delicate, cute way).Can't wait to see the Boba Guys brand grow in the city!",23,0.9833

Wonderful service as the folks behind the counter are open to explaining each flavor and giving a taste. The gelato is creamy and full of flavor. Definitely gives you a punch and you are carried away to the flavor you picked. My favorites are the salted caramel, buttery with that burnt caramel flavor and the salt takes it up a notch.

659,26,19,5.0,"This place does everything you could ask for from a winebar right. Intimate setting, limited seating (so that it doesn't become an exercise in screaming and leaning), and reasonably priced, well-executed food that actually shares well. And the fact that you can drink any bottle on the list by the glass, so long as you get at least two glasses? Patently ridiculous. The list is easy to navigate (organized geographically, then by varietal, then by price, and while the variety of reds on offer is impressive (Negoska from Greece? Strong.), in my opinion, the whites are where it's at, particularly if you're down with Chenin Blanc from France (and if you aren't, you're probably a scrub). To sweeten the deal even more, there are featured bottles at happy hour for $28, which is often borderline retail price.The greatest positive, however, is likely the staff, who are in a league of their own. Winebars typically hire either the blasé, well-coiffed jagoffs who pour you the wrong wine while staring wistfully at the equally disentranced 'models' at the other end of the bar, or the over-eager, pseudo-wonkish types who refuse to believe that you have no interest in a magnum of Screaming Eagle cabernet. The vintenders here are genuinely attentive, warm-hearted people. They truly love wine, but don't snigger at the less educated or invested. They're happy to answer questions on any level, whether it's their favorite Kabinett on the list, or what goes best with the Gypsy Salami. None of this is to say that they don't have nice hair, of course. They just aren't dead behind the eyes. If you like wine, you owe it to yourself to make a visit. And even if the dude (or lady) you've dragged out here for your requisite bi-monthly date night doesn't like fermented grape juice, they've got some pretty dope beers.

BFX Chelsea is much bigger than it appears at first glance. Great when you're talking floor space. Not so great if you're talking about someone you met on the Internet.They cater to a variety of workouts. They have a spin class I choose to ignore. I took the Build class, in the same room where they also have classes called Burn, Barre and Boxing. Clearly, all the classes that take place in this room must start with B.Build uses kettle bells, dumbbells and TRX to build muscle. Burn focuses on cardio and I imagine it looks like that scene in Flashdance where the lady is getting all splashy with the chair. Barre is like ballet and it's for women, no matter what anyone says. Boxing is pretty obvious. Marvelous Marvin Hagler yelled at me when I was a teen busboy, so I hate to generalize but boxers can kind of go to hell. I have taken three Build classes so far and hope to build mass and be beefy like The Mountain and have women wink at me and hand me their room keys in hotel bars. So far it's not going that well because I have a hard time making eye contact. It's a shame because I really want to see what my wife would say if I came home with a gym lady.This was my first exposure to the TRX system. If you're unfamiliar with the TRX system, it's an $8 strap that retails for $200. TRX absolutely destroyed me. I was sore for days.

The waitresses were so nice and friendly and explained everything to us in detail. They brought us out vinegar and taro chips. The waitress explained that we can dip a lot of our dishes in here. She also gave us a bottle of calamansi that we can add to our food or the vinegar.Baked Oysters: These breaded oysters were so delicious. It was flavorful and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Even better with a little bit of lemon on top.Spam Fries: This is exactly what you'd expect. Battered and fried spam. Tasty, but a little too heavy and salty for me. It came with a side of banana ketchup. Very interesting!Grilled Octopus: Wow this dish was exploding with flavor. First of all, the octopus was soooo tender! And eating it with the mango and the sauce was the perfect complement. So good!Sizzling Sisig: I always love sisig, but the sisig here is so good. All the meat is tender and even melts in your mouth. It's bursting with flavor and goes so well with the garlic rice. Fried Chicken with Purple Yam Waffle: The fried chicken was good, but the waffles!!! I'm usually not a fan of waffles but these... so good. It was crispy but moist and a bit denser than regular waffles. The anchovy compound butter and caramelized macapuno syrup was the perfect combination! You must try this if you come here.Duck Breast: Duck was tender, but the skin part was a bit chewy. It came sliced on a bed of veggies and a side of grilled apple and eggplant. This dish was good, but it was a bit on the sweet side for me.Mango Cheesecake: This was a bit too sweet for me, but definitely tasted the mango in it!

Look, this place has over 1,000 reviews, a fixed menu and 3 Stars flying over its Michelin constellation so I'll skip the jibber jabber and make three solid points. 1) If the white truffle risotto (add on $175) is in season just suck it up and get it. However, you'll only need 1 per table of four or per couple if you wanna throw down the sexy time card. It's just too rich and decadent for one person.

Plus or minus 15 min for the kitchen tour upon request. 3) I really wished I pocketed all the left over chocolate truffles and macaroons.

663,23,12,5.0,"A handroll bar!Had my birthday dinner here a few nights ago - they were very accommodating with my extreme tardiness. I would recommend making a reservation here ahead of time, though it seemed like they weren't as crowded as I thought they would and should be on a Saturday night. Not even a line or anything!In my opinion, DOMODOMO is underrated and is a gem of a place that doesn't seem to be too hyped up by the foodie crowd yet. The prices are reasonable, quality of food is excellent, and the service is impeccable.We were seated at the counter and served by at least three people working there. Their Japanese beer is amazing - and I don't even really like beer. The cool yuzu-smelling self-expanding hand towel thing is an added part of the whole experience.To start, we got the duck udon, which at $10, is actually very, very well priced. The duck was tender, not overcooked, and had so much flavor in it. The broth was flavorful, too. The udon noodles were of perfect consistency - overall a 10/10 for this dish. I would say however, ordering this alone would not make you full.For the rest of our meal, we got the handroll sampler ($30). We started with a mini black truffle chawanmushi that was just absolutely delicious. The black truffle was there, but wasn't overpowering like you might think it would be. So good! The rest of the hand rolls - fatty tuna, salmon, unagi, and crab were all so good and so fresh. Even the seaweed was good! I liked the hand rolls versus a roll of sushi because it seems like you get much more fish in your roll and can control how big of a bite you want. Somehow it's just... different. The guy serving us waited until we finished each one and continued to serve us, kind of like omakase-style.To finish, we had the squid ink pasta with uni, caviar, and cheddar dashi. It reminded me of a very high class mac and cheese, only because of the cheddar dashi. The squid ink pasta was probably the best textured pasta I've ever had - beyond perfectly cooked. The only complaint I have with this dish is that it could have had more uni and I'm not sure how I felt about the cheddar being thrown into the mix - very unconventional.Overall, very happy with DOMODOMO and I'm glad I chose this lesser known place for my birthday dinner!",32,0.9974

The octopus was very fresh. My favorite might be the mushrooms out of the trio. -I ordered the lobster paella. Holy moly was this a GIANT portion! I think it was meant to serve two but I will neither confirm nor deny that I ate most of it, took the rest to go, then ate it around 1 am that night. Yes it's that good. The lobster was a bit measly but the other seafood in it was generously portioned. Giant scallops, fresh mussels, etc. MUSIC/ATMOSPHERE: there's usually live music but we went on a Friday and there was just a really cool playlist. Good for date night, tons of string lights, sangrias, rustic wooden dining tables, and cute wooden bar tables for more casual diners.

Jamaica, please don't disown me!), and haven't been able to try the ackee, saltfish, or cook food. Prices are pretty standard for similar spots depending on your meat. SOUP every day.

Thankfully, we had reservations and were seated immediately. I just adore everything about this restaurant. The staff are incredibly friendly and (from what I could tell) all spoke french. We easily settled in for a long and savory night. First we obviously had to get a bottle of wine. The menus are fixed to old records which was a fun touch. Most bottles were priced $30-50 which is to be expected. Next on the to-do list was to decide on what charcuterie to get. They were able to accommodate our questions about the meats and cheeses (my favorite things to eat, surprisingly cheap at only $18 for three choices). The dish was served with grapes, honey, jam, mustard, apple cider red slaw, and of course mustard and butter. It was a dream. We ended up getting prosciutto, a creamy french cheese and blue cheese. Everything tasted just as it should if not better.Now seeing as how it was my birthday, I needed to end the night with steak and frites. The steak was delicious as I got it (medium rare). It came with a scalloped potato and greens cooked with garlic and butter. I loved it. The frites were very crispy. My boyfriend thought the soup could have been better (salty and the cheese didn't seem right) but still enjoyed it.They provided a banana creme brulee dish at the end for my birthday which was a sweet, but not toooo sweet way to end the night.

671,22,19,5.0,"I love this bar.A buddy of mine recently invited me to The Tippler for his birthday. Considering I frequent the West Village I was surprised I hadn't heard of it. Little did I know, it's a bit of an underground gem AKA a SPEAKEASY BITCH. Sorry, I didn't mean to call you that.ANYWAY, The Tippler is underneath the Chelsea Market and it's quite large. Like really large. What's interesting about the Tippler is you could easily miss it. The entrance is inconspicuous (DUH, IT'S A SPEAKEASY BRO) and once inside, you have to go down two sets of stairs to get to the bar.The inside is great. It's on the darker side, but the low key lighting, rugs and optional tables on the side give it a really chill, almost apartment like vibe (despite the fact that it's so large). Obviously, the size of this joint is a huge bonus because I've never gone and felt uncomfortably crowded and there's always somewhere you can escape if you want to have a more intimate conversation with friends or if you're trying to woo a lovely lady (or in my case, getting horribly rejected).The drinks are a tad pricey (it's the West Village after all), but they are fantastic, unique and tasty. Personally, I'm like a chick when it comes to drinks and I often find myself annoyed that drinks are over poured with booze as opposed to well crafted. Thankfully, The Tippler makes strong, delicious cocktails. For example, I love the Derek Smalls:It consists of Zubrówka bison grass vodka, cucumber, grapefruit, anise, mint. I don't know what the hell bison grass vodka even means, but I do know this drink basically tastes like an alcoholic green smoothie and you better believe the chick in me was loving this drink.LASTLY and although insignificant to my friends, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE (yes three loves, no shame people) that The Tippler offers self serve spa water (infused with lime, cucumber or something spa like). After a heavy night of drinking, this was SO clutch as I progressively drank water throughout the night and woke up the next day sans a hangover. Not to mention, it provided fodder for a series of jokes like, ""Alright bro, hit me with one more for the road, but that's the last one"" as we pretended to be grizzled truckers taking shots of water. CLEARLY, my friends and I are a cool bunch.ONE THING, I would keep in mind with The Tippler IS there's something depressing about how dark and underground it is. NOW, I say that having come to The Tippler in the middle of the summer and summertime in NY is all about outdoor drinking. SO, I think this is the absolutely PERFECT winter bar and I'll will undoubtedly be frequenting this place come the colder weather.FINAL NOTE: I left my credit card at The Tippler for over two weeks due PURELY to laziness. When I reached out, not only were they friendly and accommodating, but they had taken good care of the ol' girl (the ""ol' girl"" being my credit card of course).5 stars all around for Tippler and once winter comes, a bar that will be apart of my consistent rotation.",26,0.999

I recalled the fledgling days of my youth, the nascent buds of young love, the first time I laid naked eyes on my untamed ChildManLover, gliding over the sinusoidal waves of his ginger peaks and valleys. And then the grandmother of all dishes. Layers upon layers of Chianina Beef Carpaccio spread generously, interspersed with sea urchin and topped with caviar. The carpaccio yielded to my tongue without resistance. The sea urchin was as delicate as a lover's touch, and the caviar a product of their love. The holy trinity of sea treasures, together in one place. An explosion of culinary chemistry. I let myself succumb to it willingly, casting away all my worldly worries to be simply and utterly awash in this sea of joy.Rising cost of tuition? Looming water crisis? Such trivialities. Pick up all the litter from your humdrum life and stuff it in the back of your closet. Put on your best suit and head to ZZ's because sometimes, unchecked indulgence is just what you need.",26,0.9871
674,22,12,5.0,"Oh my goodness gracious. I was going to not write a review at first because I assumed all Ethiopian restaurants in NY were about this level amazing, but after a recent bad dining experience elsewhere, I've decided to give Injera the great review it deserves because it is my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in the city. The ambiance here is so cute and romantic. The service is AMAZING. They are so friendly and take the time to explain each dish and make sure that you have everything you need. But I know you guys just care about the food, so let me get to that. The Yetimatim Fitfit (diced tomato, red onion, tomatoes, avocado, green chilies & pieces of injera with olive oil lemon dressing) has been the best Ethiopian appetizer I've ever had. It's such a great take on the usual Ethiopian salad. My roommate and I had the Vegetarian Combination for Two and we were in heaven. Usually the vegetarian dishes at other Ethiopian restaurants aren't so flavorful, but this was the most flavor-filled dish I've had in a long time. I don't know why anyone would complain about small portions. I eat like a truck and even I was like rolling out the door by the end of dinner. I didn't even have room for ice cream which is unheard of! Anyways, I highly suggest anyone who loves flavor and spices to go go go to Injera!",28,0.9968
675,32,32,5.0,"I'M LITERALLY GOING TO HAVE A PANIC ATTACK DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MARK IS ONLY 3.5 STARS ON YELP. It's times like these I wish I could give a Yelp seminar on what makes a great restaurant. If someone were to ask me what my favorite restaurant is in Manhattan (I eat out LITERALLY every single day and most days, twice a day, usually at top notch restaurants) I would say The Mark. Why you ask? Well let me explain...ATMOSPHEREUpper east side traditional with a modern twist. The crowd is definitely the movers and shakers of the Upper East Side. The restaurant oozes modern luxury (the hotel does as well).SERVICEThe service is always great. Sure maybe there are a few hiccups here and there but honestly nothing to get upset about or notice. The first time I ever came here my friend made a joke about it being a special night or something and the waitress brought over a complementary dessert. It's that small touch that brought me back here a second time with my family and friends.FOODHere. We. Go!I really don't enjoy eating at ""fusion places"" which blend different styles of food together or places that have large menu's. I feel like a restaurant should pick one thing and just be very good at that. Well, 1- The Mark has a HUGE menu. HUGE. HUGE. HUGE. The Mark has everything from sushi to fresh seafood to steak to pizza, pasta, cheeseburgers, veal, lamb, chicken... do I really have to continue?! You will feel anxiety just reading the menu as the choices are honestly endless.2- Definitely has a fusion of many different types of cuisine all on one menu. Yet all surprisingly well executed.+ Seafood platter (small portion) - Absolutely delicious and was an amazing thing for 4 of us to share. I think it's honestly priced lower than it should be for a seafood platter of that size so take advantage of this!+++ Lobster - ABSOLUTELY the best thing on the menu that I have eaten thus far. While it was plated differently the two times that I dined at The Mark, the flavor was still the same.+ Lamb - My friend stated that this was one of the best lamb's he has ever had.+ Crispy sushi - Really great. I was cautious with this dish as I eat sushi as some of the best sushi counters in the world and am extremely picky with raw fish but this was not bad. For a place with such a big menu, I was very surprised at how good this dish was. + Char grilled octopus - DelishI can't remember the other dishes that I had but those were the ones that really stood out to me.DESSERTI'm actually not a big sweets person. I used to be and then thankfully grew out of that stage (thankfully as in calories-wise). +++++ BUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING - Salty, sweet, butterscotchy. Dear Lord! One of the best desserts that I have ever consumed in my entire life. I absolutely adored this.+ Angel food cake - Delish but not as good as my butterscotch pudding ^+ Vanilla ice-cream with chocolate sauce - Sounds very simple but this dish had a lot of flavor actually. It comes very nicely presented as well. + Selection of sorbets - Also very well plated and tasty.I am a HUGE fan and will definitely make this a regular spot.",39,0.9995
676,19,31,5.0,"So I'm at the bodega and Mario (the hardest working man in Two Bridges), while slicing my Boar's Head Honey Turkey, tells me that a new bar has opened up the block. Now, anywhere else in Manhattan another bar opening would be about as newsworthy as another Cosby accuser coming forward (actually, I guess that is still newsworthy...but you get the point). If you are at all familiar with my personal Chinese shtetl, and particularly the immediate surrounding streets where rats dine on the finest fish guts this side of the Yangtze, you would understand my intrigue upon hearing this news. Several days later while walking my gf's dog we passed by and went in to take a look. We both were kinda shocked to see what they had done inside this former nondescript storefront on the most random block in the city (maybe Mechanics Alley is the new poor man's Freeman Alley?). So, yeah, the bar looked great, not a dumpy dive bar, but nothing pretentious or artificial either...just right. Since it had just opened and it was mid-afternoon, we were the only customers there. After scoping out the inside I went to see what they had on tap and met the bartender and part owner Aisa (class act). As my adoring 17 yelp fans are well aware, the only thing I really care about is if a bar has perfectly carbonated ice cold Coors Light on tap (go ahead, roll your uppity eyes and judge me, but I won't apologize for enjoying the best domestic beer ever made). Imagine my delight upon learning that they have Coors Banquet on tap ( business.time.com/2013/1… ). Just as Coors is considered the prototypical uncool beer, Mr. Fong's location is equally uncool, or maybe so uncool it is cool (I suspect this is their angle). After having a beer and one of their signature cocktails, we checked out the jukebox which was also impressive. I have not been back since that first time, but have passed by several times and it was crowded! Who the hell are these people and where did they come from?! I get the feeling more and more that in a couple years I'm not going to recognize my neighborhood (and since it is such a dump, I'm fine with that...sorry, I meant I will fight gentrification and organize the community to keep the streets smelling like fish guts). Seriously, I'm happy to see that Mr. Fong's is doing well and hope to return soon.",28,0.9895

It's in a very ugh part of town, midtown east. I remember approaching the spot and seeing him leaning against the streetlight in his white polo shirt and khaki shorts like some sort of preppy pied piper.I was wearing black leather combat boots, grey acid-washed jeans, an oversized asymmetrical hoodie, and my school backpack.We were like two enemy chess pieces, meeting covertly off-the-board to discuss a possible armistice despite our bloodthirsty generals.We go in and order some sake. I'd furtively eaten a cream cheese bagel on a park bench right before, because we were meeting for ""drinks"" at dinner time and I'm the rare bird on this island that actually likes to eat three meals a day.Anyway, the conversation went like this:him: So, how's school?me: It's ok.him: So, how's life?me: It's ok.Hehe. I don't know. Then I grabbed the mic and started asking the questions. Because I was never socialized properly into society, my questions went like this:me: Do you want to die by fire or drowning or buried alive?him: Drowning.me: Lame.me: Would you move to the jungle if it had great wifi?him: I guess so...me: Wrong, the insects would kill you.It continued like this until he got drunk to escape me, a trend that has carried on to this very day. I didn't think I was drunk until I caught myself leering at my reflection in the mirror with a knowing smile when I was washing my hands in the washroom. That's when I knew I was a little sauced up too.We played a little ""guess what those people over there are about"" but it was not too stimulating. Everyone there was obviously a 37-year-old office worker relaxing over drinks with co-workers before taking a commuter train home.After a few rounds of drinks, he said, ""Want to order food?""I said I was not hungry.The other thing is that I had planned to go to a Danish house party later that night. Our first date had been short, so I'd assumed this date would be short, too.But I realized that I liked how he took my questions seriously, mulled over them respectfully, so I invited him to come to the Danish house party with me.Outside on the sidewalk, we were shy and formal again. We hopped into a cab and sped towards the East Village.It was our first time in a motor vehicle together. I pointed out my favorite street meat vendor spots. He blanched at ""street meat"" but that's what I still call it to this day. It is meat that you eat in the street: street meat.Anyway, before we went to the Danish house party, we decided to get some more drinks at DGBG first. I don't recall how that came to be. To wash down the sake?I had a martini. He had a martini.Next, I remember walking against traffic up Bowery. There's that soft spring wind that swirls around at night like you're being caressed by ghosts. My boots stomping with unnecessary assertiveness.

His excitement about pizza and the history of the New York pizza landscape is impressive. I love that he has these little gadgets like his temperature gun and his tiny pizza wheel. You get a goodie bag that is awesome! My favorite thing in it were the gummies that looked like pizza. The tour I went on was the original walking tour (I forgot the actual name of it).

679,22,31,5.0,"I booked a couples massage with my girlfriend. She got there earlier than me and texted me while waiting downstairs, saying that it seemed sketchy.I arrived a few minutes late and we walked up the stairs into a nice little spa. And no, it was not sketchy, they were really professional.The couples massage room is 2 fights up, we had to wait a little because they were behind schedule. This place is small but clean. The rooms are separated by curtains. The best part is that there is a sign on the wall saying ""no hanky panky"" and to not take off your underwear. I read the no hanky panky part but did not read the rest and took off everything by mistake.The massage was good, if you check in with yelp, you get an extra 10min for free. $36 for 70 min of massage?

680,17,12,5.0,"When deciding where to eat tonight with friends, this restaurant name resonated with us so we decided to give it a try. We arrived around 7:30 on a Saturday night - they don't take reservations for parties smaller than six so we were expecting a wait. Surprisingly, we were seated pretty quickly - 5 to 7 minute wait at most. The restaurant is small and bustling - the dining room is decorated simply with an impressive bar upon entry and a huge golden pizza oven in the back. We decided to share everything ; we started with the beets which came with pickled red onion, pistachios, and ricotta salata and the kale which came with garlic, chili flakes, and ricotta salata. Both were great, but I especially liked the kale; it was seasoned well and I was in heaven with those bulbs of roasted garlic. We then shared the gemelli pasta which was served in a pesto sauce and topped with stracciatella cheese. The pasta was good - it was cooked al dente and the stracciatella was a nice touch. We couldn't leave without trying the pizza, so we decided to split two of them. As the name of the restaurant suggests, the pizzas are wood fired. They're meant to be individual-sized and have a rustic look to them with charred edges and an overall irregular shape. We went with the goat cheese and the J. Sexton. Both were great - the flavors worked well with each other and the wood-firing technique really showed. Service was awesome; everyone from the hostess who greeted us to chef Chas Anderson himself did a really great job - super impressed! I had a great experience overall - definitely a place I would return.",21,0.9972
681,24,14,5.0,"See my last review for more details if you'd like, but I feel obligated to bump up my rating to 5 stars. I came here this past weekend for the first time in a month or so, and have nothing but positive things to say. The crowd is boisterous but not obnoxiously so, the bartenders are downright awesome, and obviously, the beer list is expansive, creative and diverse. And tasty. Can't forget tasty.Even when this place is packed as it was this past weekend, I'm always aware of how full of good vibes it is. Lots of chill people with a passion for beer, just looking to have a more low-key night. Something about Arts and Crafts being below street level makes it like a cozy little nook. I love it. If you didn't get that already.I felt the need to update my review because on this past trip, I conquered a flight of 12 beers with a friend. We're both very into craft beer and are interested in sampling as much as we can (responsibly, of course), so we were very much up for the challenge. A flight of 12 (1/2 board) is 45 bucks. If you're splitting that between two people, it's a really really good deal. That's 25ish per person if you're including tip, which is basically 1.5 cocktails at a speakeasy. If you check out my picture, you'll see that they give you good-sized glasses, so don't get too overzealous or you WILL get blackout. I can't see how you wouldn't. When we asked the bartender about the full flight (24), he said ""well, it's possible...."". But the two of us wanted to find our way home that night, so we did the responsible thing.First things first - you'll get a paper and pencil to list your choices. They were actually out of a few beers we had listed, but fortunately that meant that a number of beers on their ""coming soon"" list was coming...right then and there. So voila, more beers to choose from - if there weren't enough already! They give you your flight based on the order of the beers you've chosen. I'm not sure if all racks are circular (I'm guessing they are), but you're encouraged to go clockwise. The first beer you pick will be at 1 o'clock (I mean, technically you can make it whatever o' clock you want but you get the point), and then you just rotate around. Simple enough. If you're with someone who's as interested in broadening their craft beer horizons as you are, I'd highly recommend this option. They've got such an impressive draft list and for someone who's addicted to trying new things, the flight option is really the only option.",38,0.996

683,17,8,5.0,"I've been to HandCraft kitchen and cocktails primarily for their fantastic beer selection, but I got to try a tasting menu the other night and they exceeded my expectations! Come here for the drinks, but stay here for the food! Here are some of the highlights of the evening!For starters, we had the Louisiana Gumbo that had some nice heat to eat without it being overpowering. Perfect for the cool weather we've been experiencing. I also loved their Baltimore Crab Cakes which is paired perfectly with their lime Aioli. For fans of deviled eggs, you've got to try their Buffalo Deviled eggs with chicken and blue cheese.Their salad course was a Kale Salad served with Farro, quinoa and roasted corn in a delicious burnt lime vinagrette. The salad was very hearty and I could definitely go for an entree size. For their pasta course, we were treated with an excellent version of Mac and Cheese which was farfalle served with gruyere, asiago, bacon, and bechamel with garlic bread crumbs.For their entrees, I highly recommend their Wilde Game Meatloaf served with bison, wild boar and duck in a homemade bourbon bbq ketchup. Also try their Bison Burger with avocado, bacon, manchego and chipotle aioli. They also served seared salmon on a wasabi mash! WASABI MASH! Wow!Thankfully, their dessert course was a light vanilla panna cotta with wild berry sauce. The perfect way to end a large meal!For drinks, you can't go wrong with any of Alex's creations! I love the Berry Lemonade which he makes with a black and blueberry strawb, a drinking vinegar. Trust me, it tastes delicious. The Red Wagon Wheel uses house made ginger beer and fernet branca. If you want a traditional whiskey sour made right, Alex is your man. But if you really want something special, order the Fiery Porch. It has both a spicy and alcoholic kick that will keep you coming back for more!Thanks HandCraft Kitchen and Cocktail for a wonderful experience.

684,18,15,5.0,"I hardly do any yoga any more. In fact, I have skipped yoga for several years now. Truth be told, I have barely been working out lately. So it was with considerable skepticism that I signed up for a class at Lyons Den, a brisk five-minute Eastward walk from where I live.The venue has had some interesting uses for it previously. But the makeover to being a yoga studio is impressive. It has a very East Village vibe to it--casual and inviting--but a distinct Tribeca feel when you factor in the loftier setting and the older crowd relative to the college kids flocking along St. Mark's Place.The owners--Bethany and John--are very friendly and engaging. Bethany seems to be a unique talent who is motivating, mindfully merciless with the intensity of the flow, and has great command over what goes on in her class. The other instructors seem very effective as well--Annie, Meg and Brooke to name a few. The power flow yoga classes operate at a brisk pace, and are sure to leave you sweating and well exercised. Is Lyons Den at an early stage of its evolution and growth when everything is brand-new and everyone is friendly and accessible? I sure hope not. While I can't see how the business could grow in its current location, I suspect new locations could spring up over time. Hopefully not at the expense of diluting Bethany's and the other teachers' commitment to this Tribeca gem.",27,0.9922

The ambiance is intimate, airy, and open. I showed up a few minutes before my friends arrived at at noon, this place was just starting their day. I had a choice of any table in the house. Sweet. My friends showed up and we started salivating over the menu. One of my friends and I decided to order a half carafe of house rose. Good amount of alcohol to share and all wines from Greece. This place does a very decent job showcasing Greek food (I am a fan). Too bad they were out of the octopus, because that is what I really wanted to try. My friends and I decided on a few plates to share including spanakopita ($10), taramosalata ($6), fave beans dip ($6), sauteed shrimp ($11), zucchini chips with mustard dip ($8), and roasted potatoes ($6). Everything was very tasty and flavorful, and came with unlimited amounts of homemade grilled toast with olive oil. The standouts would have to be the taramosalata and the zucchini chips.

686,25,16,5.0,"This is review #300. I had saved it for a special place and mŏkbar fits that bill.They say true geniusoften strikes in the pale moments between awake and asleep. I must have been sleepwalking all these years because I haven't truly had Korean-style ramen until today and the experience I had, by definition, was a culinary eye-opener. This brings us to why we feel mŏkbar is deserving of 4.8/5.0mŏkbar, the brainchild of NJ-native Esther Choi, began operating in Chelsea Market in May of 2014, billed as the first Korean-style ramen in the city. (They're situated across from Los Tacos #1 which I'm not a fan of... you can read my review on that.) Riding on a wave of high acclaim from media outlets, Esther's Food Network appearance on Beat Bobby Flay (aired Sept 4, 2014, in case you're interested) catapulted the restaurant into the cross hairs of the masses for better or worse. Having cut her teeth with experience at ilili, and La Esquina also helped hone her craft from training at Institute of Culinary Education (ICE).When I first visited one afternoon, months earlier, I had the classic ramen, my mistake- it didn't set my palate on fire. I returned to rectify this on a Thursday Chelsea gallery opening night, ordering dishes until I bursted with fruit-flavor.FOODFor small plates or as it should be called, anju, we ordered Ho'Cakes, Japchae dumplings, tteokbokki, and spicy Mok wings. Anju is typically accompanied by alcohol so we simply had to have the soju sampler (where each glass come flavored by a different fruit or inspiration- sorry, I can't remember them all) The Ho'cakes, otherwise known as hotteok, are every bit as amazing as I've heard about these savory stuffed pancakes of pork. Every morsel with satisfying chew, it was probably not meant to be shared, because it will fall apart if you try to cut into one of the halves! hahaha. The japchae dumplings, although true to the dish that it draws inspiration from, I prefer my japchae served up on a plate, not so much in the form of a dumpling (just my preference), however the dumpling had a nice crisp to them and the glass noodles danced around inside my mouth with the accompanying sauce being spot-on. The tteokbokki was a nice surprise because I've made them at home with gochujang and so I know that the rice cakes are typically huge logs with satisfying chew. Their take is a fantastic departure in that they're the size of penne with crisp, chew, and heat all in the same bite! This would ideally go great with beer in any case. They were still crispy even while marinating in the sauces. Impressive! Finally, the Mok wings, which we ordered spicy were marinated in gochujang, the right amount of kick without overpowering the flavor of the wings. Simply fun to eat, much like the tteokbokki.For my entree, I ordered the kimchi ramen along with porkbelly and extra noodles because you can never have enough. I enjoy these soups that're served hot, and also packing sufficient heat despite the summer months. The presentation is all there, Sun Noodles, as ever-present in commercially produced ramen, is also nice to see. The porky soup broth provides the requisite kick and flavor from the kimchi, as expected. The cabbage itself provides all the veggies I'd like to eat for the night. All-in-all, I love it without the egg. Definitely on-par with all the ramen heavy-hitters in the city.SERVICEService is as quick and attentive as you'd expect from a standalone restaurant, making sure your table never runs out of water, getting small plates to the table first, getting entrees out altogether, checking on your experience- basically all the little things which always ends up mattering so much.ETCVegan ramen is offered, and this means miso-based. (This is huge) A restaurant offering a menu set of this size is remarkable considering the space/kitchen they have to work with. They have seating by the kitchen counter and in the back, away from the prying eyes and those seat-vultures in Chelsea Market. (Yes, like you, I am one too) The only drawback I find with mŏkbar is that it's set within the busy energy that is Chelsea Market, amidst the hustle and bustle of shoppers, stragglers, lunch-goers, foodies, I've heard my fair share of ignoramus commentary while waiting a few minutes for my table like ""What kind of Chinese is this??"" and so I also don't especially welcome the prying eyes burning into the back of my skull, nor the onlookers with the look of bemusement, gazing at the ""bizarre foods"" that I'm savoring.SUMMARYmŏkbar is a solid, casual dining option among various non-competing choices in Chelsea Market, catering to both tourists and worker-bees alike from around the area (e.g. Google), the only Korean eatery within the Chelsea/MePa districts, offering ramen and gastropub (anju) fare. I can see Esther take the mŏkbar concept into it's own standalone restaurant, as it truly deserve a home to call it's own. 4.8/5.0",26,0.9961
687,26,15,5.0,"Lawrence and David are my shit. Alyssa kills it, too. Katharine is great and so is Siobhan.This yoga studio was hard for me to find. I visited at least five other studios in my search of 'the one'. My journey ended when I found Modo. Hot, sweaty classes with great facilities and conscious teachers. It's a beautiful thing.Start off with the traditional 'Modo' class if your even somewhat new to yoga and especially to Modo. Even if it's just one, take it and get comfortable with it. It's always the same postures every single class so you know what to expect. They have different time lengths 90, 75, and 60. Next, try Modo Flow. Similar to Modo in that it's the same postures every class BUT it's more challenging. You get in numerous chatarungas and it's very similar to a typical vinyasa flow but always consistent. Again, they offer different lengths of time in the classes.Then, grab a freestyle flow. Vinyasa class with ever changing postures and sometimes (depending on what it says on the schedule) they have music playing in the background. These teachers don't mess around...come ready to sweat and flow.Then my favorite....Yin Yang. Get your flow on for the first half of class (think freestyle flow) then slow it down and get into the yin portion. You will walk in there thinking it's not that hot and that you absolutely will not be sweaty and then just wait. This class will kick your butt and stretch you out in the most delicious ways. Lawrence is my favorite teacher for this style of class. They offer 60 minute versions but try the 75 minute. It doesn't get any better, really.One other thing that reeeally turned me on to Modo is the locker rooms. Clean showers but best of all, lockers that lock. Out of all the NY studios I visited before Modo, NONE had lockers I could lock. I've had my debit card and ID stolen at a studio before so that's a huge priority to me.

Luckily, it lived up to its' hype!I made a ressie about 3 weeks out and was only able to nab a 6:15 pm reservation on a Wednesday so make sure you book early! Ressies were made quickly via OpenTable. My parents and I walked in and were seated right away. The space itself is pretty darn small - mostly 2-4 seater tables with a handful of bar seats. We saw some walk-ins throughout the evening that were able to eat at the bar so perhaps you will have luck with that sans ressies!For the three of us, we ordered the following:Fried Chicken $12 - YUMMM. Can't go wrong with fried chicken. This is basically a cutlet split up into 7 or so pieces. The batter on this was perf and the dipping sauce delish.Jang-Jo-Rim $10 - This was recommended by the waiter to round out our meal. It was SO good. The butter on this was amazing.Truffle Seafood $18 - I could have done without this dish.

692,21,15,5.0,"I know that there are three different hand-rolled ice cream locations in NYC, but I have so far only been to two, and of those, I would strongly recommend choosing this location, I-CE-NY (not sure why all those hyphens are there, but who cares, I'm here to judge the food, not the name). My gf is a huge Instagram food blogger (check out HungryNYC if you ever get a chance) and was invited over by the owners to come check them out. She brought me along and we came here on a Saturday afternoon to put the taste to the test.We arrived at 12 when it opened, but it was still closed. I gave them a call and they apologized that they forgot to flip the sign outside. We entered soon after and told them that we were there from the Instagram page. The guy at the counter (Danny... or Dani. Sorry, I asked how to spell your name and I already forgot) smiled and explained to us the origins of the hand-rolled ice cream and handed each of us a menu. The gf wanted to split an ice cream (NEVERRR) but I acquiesced and decided on the Thai Iced Tea flavor with lychee (part of the set-ice creams on the back of the menu). Then we watched one of the servers make the ice cream.The whole liquid nitrogen technique is really awesome. I saw it once at 10 Below, but it was cool to see the little differences here. 10 Below usually rolls 4 larger logs for one bowl, but I-CE-NY makes around 7-8 smaller ones, so it actually looks more presentable. We sat down with our ice cream and immediately dug in (no we did not... my gf took 5 minutes taking photos, during which the ice cream started inevitably melting). The ice cream texture was a bit rubbery because of the mixed in lychees, so that was odd. However, the flavors were all there and it had a nice, strong, complex taste that I think puts it far above its competitor. The only thing was that I didn't think that the pocky sticks it came with added to the taste - it's cute and fun, but flavor-wise didn't do much for me. The servers probably noticed me feeling very sad about the lack of my own ice cream, so they made one just for me! It was the strawberry cheesecake one with strawberry puree and cheesecake bits on top. This one had a more subtle flavor, but the presentation was nicer. The gf had a field day doing the photoshoot. Overall, I think the Thai Iced Tea had a better flavor and was more delicious. Both are AMAZING though. We 100% want to return to try the other flavors. This is the best new ice cream shop for both flavor and service!*EDIT* We came back exactly a week later because we couldn't resist staying away. Tried the Green Tea with condensed milk, mocha, and poppers. BEST ONE SO FAR. Also got the banana chocolate. Delicious as well!

Only three employees knew my secret plans to propose here, but everyone treated us like royalty anyway, from the entry process to the elevator ride, to the CityPulse demonstrations, even the gift shop. As someone who frequents Yankee Stadium (also managed by Legends Hospitality) you really can't put a price on good service - well actually, maybe that's what those $10 stadium hot dogs are all about - I digress.The friendly folks in One Mix restaurant (the ""middle"" of the three tiers of dining options) who were aware of the proposal plans really went above and beyond.

Due to a poorly-planned Sunday evening nap time, we ended up dinnerless at 10 p.m. Our usual go-to was closed, so we turned to yelp for suggestions. 4.5 stars is a good sign anywhere, so we came here. It's an unassuming little hole-in-the-wall near alphabet city, sunken into a small stretch of lane peppered with other small foodie joints. To be honest, we expected to eat well but nothing fancy. The photocopied menu doesn't say much about the amazing fare available. You're best off asking the waitstaff for their top recommendation or what people order the most often - their obvious enthusiasm and intimate familiarity with the menu was very refreshing and got us very excited about our food!We had the cold tofu, the beef sashimi, the omelet and the chicken nanban as well as the Kagua blanc beer. We were the only ones in the restaurant, so everything came out at the perfect pace - not too quick, not too slow. The tofu is dry-aged for two days, so it has a custardy texture (the aging process allows the whey to naturally drain out). They top it with a sharp-flavored leafy garnish in addition to fresh scallions with homemade dashi soy sauce. Mmm! The dashi was a little bit salty but it helped with the creamy tofu texture. I just dipped sparingly - no big deal. As the waiter passionately explained, the raw beef (washu, I believe?) is a hybrid between Kobe and Angus cattle for a medium-marbled fatty texture that isn't too heavy afterward. It was scrumptious and didn't even require any of the dipping sauce to taste delicious. I wrapped mine around some of the green scallions and left out the wasabi to enjoy the full beef flavor on my tongue. Mmm. The chicken nanban was the juiciest bite of fried goodness I've ever had. It tastes like the chicken is marinated in the same salad dressing it comes with, and then lightly battered and fried. The ranchy-tartare sauce was a little overwhelming for my personal taste, but you can easily scrape off any excess if you so choose. The salad was very fresh and light - the perfect complement to the chicken. As for the kagua beer, it was very light with some unique piquant notes to it. My beer palate isn't very refined so I can't tell you from taste how it stood out; I'll just rely on the waiter's description of it being a Japanese-flavored beer made in Belgium that sold out in Japan in two weeks - special water used for the brewing process, and some special Japanese ingredients (I believe yuzu citrus and a Japanese chili pepper?). Delicious and well worth the $12. The little details, like very high-quality disposable chopsticks, are what make this place a five-star experience.

It had everything I wanted--matcha snow, mochi, grass jelly, condensed milk--everything except... red beans! So for 50 cents I added the red bean topping and it was BOMB. I love the matcha flavor. It was not too sweet and had that familiar grassy taste I love (but it wasn't overwhelming!). Maybe, just maybe, if I scrutinize the flavor, it could be a little less sweet (I felt a sticky, sweet aftertaste in my mouth but that could be from the condensed milk). Overall, great flavor!For the uninitiated, the Made in Taiwan combo is VERY traditional Taiwanese/Japanese. Once you try it, you will know exactly why matcha + mochi + grass jelly + condensed milk (AND RED BEAN) always go hand in hand!

I just moved here and was frantically Yelping bubble tea/boba places near campus, since I'm used to having 5-6 near me at all times in California. Although Culture Tea Bar was highly rated, it didn't seem like as many people knew about it or went there. This made me question how good it really was, but I decided to give it a try. What a treat!I ordered an iced osmanthus oolong milk tea with less sugar ($3.50), and though it was slightly sweeter than I would have preferred, the tea flavor was distinct and fragrant. I was very impressed to learn that they brew each tea to order with loose-leaf tea leaves (using a tea brewing machine that looks similar to an espresso maker). It was refreshing to see that they had actual tea variations like Fuji Apple Black Tea, Cherry Blossom Green Tea, and Blended Black Tea rather than flavors (caramel, taro, etc.) that rely heavily on powders and syrups.They do take credit card, but remember that there's a $3.50 minimum. Since there's wifi and some limited seating, it would be a nice place for studying when it's not too crowded. However, the tiny space can get quite cramped, so I'd recommend getting a drink to-go.

The strawberry had a strong taste of the berry in that same smooth cream. Repetition may ensure you get bored with your cone and cup but the flashing lightbulb in your tongue and tummy will tell you then to lick the ice cream off some sweet someone. Because fellow Yelpers, even if you have the same flavor over and over again, this ice cream you won't tire of. It is really good.

703,20,16,5.0,"Friday 09/18/15: I was really in the mood for Sammy's Downtown Bistro, but had never been to Rosie's Bistro Italiano (just up the block from Sammy's) and my aunt told me that I would not be disappointed. She was 100 percent correct! I would probably give the overall experience a 4 stars, but the risotto served with my entree bumps it up to a solid 5! This is a cute Italian restaurant in downtown Bronxville, located near the train station, pharmacies, grocery store and other restaurants. I stopped in for an early dinner on Friday and was sad to hear that this place does NOT do happy hour. No sweat, though. I was greeted by the hostess, who walked my aunt and I to our booth. Our server was Kristen, who listed the specials for the evening and was very friendly and helped to answer my questions--5 stars for service. She was quick and made sure to check in between courses, and ask how everything was. 1. Arugula, pear, gorgonzola salad with pecans and cranberries--absolutely delicious! Lightly dressed to perfection. I'm not a huge gorgonzola fan, but do enjoy this combination in a salad.2. Pasta Di Bosco--linguine, wild mushrooms, artichokes, pancetta and garlic tossed in white truffle oil. This wasn't my dish, but it was outstanding and had quite a bit of truffle, not just a hint--one of my least favorite things to encounter when promised this divine treat. This was a really satisfying dish, although I would have enjoyed a bit more pancetta. Seemed a bit scarce.3. Pan-Seared Chilean Sea Bass in a tomato white wine sauce. This was topped with toasted pignolis and served with a parmesan risotto, plus two negligible asparagus stalks. The risotto stole the show! This cheesy, truffle-hinted, veggie-speckled rice was creamy, smooth and needed no additional help to brighten up my hectic week! I actually, exercised incredible restraint by only eating half of and leaving the remainder for my leftovers the next day. MMMMM. The sea bass was flaky and had a nice thin crust on the outer layer. This dish was one of the specials for the evening and I wasn't originally certain that this was what I wanted for dinner, but the risotto and our server's very positive attitude about it made me curious. I stand by my choice. 4. After feeling that there was no way on earth we could possibly make room for another morsel of food, we decided to consider that the dessert menu might feel left out if we didn't at least give it a peek. Choc-a-holic that I am, (and considering the medicated cookie dough that was a prequel to dinner), I suggested to my aunt that there was no harm in SPLITTING the chocolate souffle with vanilla bean gelato. The gelato was decent, but nowhere near the best I'd had, and the souffle could have been a touch warmer. It was served with one lonely strawberry and s sprig of fresh mint. It was a 4-star dessert. I would love to give this place a second try and see if the peach/blueberry cobbler is as amazing as it sounds. I'd recommend to anyone who wants a taste of great Italian food.",25,0.9968

705,22,11,5.0,"Tanoshi has long been on my list of omakase places to try. Despite all of the good things that have been said about it and the high grade fish, the restaurant itself is unassuming and low key. The sushi bar seats 10 people and there are three sushi chefs, one for each corner of the bar. This was on the side we were on (they have 2 storefronts). The omakase is $65 per person and it includes 10 pieces of nigiri, one handroll and 3 small sushi rolls. While the omakase itself may be reasonably priced - there are a lot of items available for a la carte that can rack up your bill. There are two lists on the wall of the appetizers and the add on pieces and a hand drawn map of where all the fish is sourced from. We ordered the Chawanmushi, the Ikura Uni and Ankimo. The Chawanmushi was delectable - the texture was silky smooth and there were pieces of chicken, shrimp and peas inside. The Ikura Uni was basically a sandwich composed of salmon, squid and Uni and boy was it a generous helping. In fact, I think there were more parts of Uni than salmon. The ankimo, or monk fish liver, is a must have. The texture can take some getting used to but it is definitely one of my favorites. The omakase began with fluke. The fluke was delicately sliced with an interwoven technique and it was the perfect size. Next, we had the Alaskan king salmon, seared in propane for a few seconds. Salmon is one of my favorites, so this was very enjoyable. One of the more exciting pieces was the Amber jack fish topped with a cherry blossom leaf. The leaf was edible and extremely fragrant. I also really enjoyed the firefly squid - something I've never tried before. While the rest of the pieces were delicious, I think it's important to discuss the add ons. The normal sea urchin that Tanoshi uses is from Maine. It is absolutely satisfying but for sea urchin connoisseurs, you will want to order the Japanese Uni - which is from Hokkaido. Another must try piece is the Triple X - salmon roe, sea urchin and quail egg. This piece is absolutely exquisite. My friend tried the ice fish. This is poached - which we did not know beforehand. There was a novelty about this but we probably wouldn't order this again. Instead, I would have tried the crab brain. Shout out to Geronimo who really made our meal!

My guilty pleasures include: (you guessed it) food.A friend of mine had suggested that we go to 11 Madison Park for quite some time. Alas, just a few short days after they were named the 5th best restaurant in the world, we decided to make a reservation and go all out.I will start off by saying that I truly enjoy food ""experiences"". I love 5+ hour meals, tasting menu's, cocktail and wine pairings, you name it! I feel that this is lost in the modern age of dining as usually people want to get in and get out. Not me and not 11 Madison Park. Don't come here if you want a quick meal or really anything less than 3 hours. Don't rush. Don't panic. Relax. Woooooosa. It's okay. Sitting down for a great length of time and trying out heavenly dishes isn't so bad, trust me!DECOR & AMBIANCEArt deco/former bank. To be honest, I'm not really a fan of art deco or bank ""decor"". I would just say that this isn't my style. However, a great deal of people LOVE the decor here so it's really just a matter of preference. The ambiance is great as it just oozes elegance. Everyone is dressed from head to toe in pure perfection. One word: Classic.SERVICETop-notch. Would you expect anything less? The service was absolutely perfect (and usually poor service is my greatest pet peeve at restaurants). Bravo!FOODWhile I've had some truly exceptional meals in my lifetime, this one was definitely in the rankings. Every dish was obviously very tasty and delicious but I was particularly surprised by the creativity behind each dish. At the very end of the meal, chocolates were presented with a little guessing game. Many different flavors were presented and one would have to match the unknown flavors to their names. Later, someone brought a cheat sheet and provided the correct answers. I really liked this as it just seemed like a really fun way to end the evening.Will I be back? Yes. I want to come back and try their lunch actually. MMM MMMMMM MMM!Come here expecting not just a meal but an experience.+ Also make sure you ask for a tour of the kitchen! It's immaculate!",25,0.9945

Luckily for me, anything in the boroughs can be found in one form or another in Manhattan.After a trek through Chinatown, I stumbled across this place.For starters, it had air conditioning on a really muggy day, so that was a huge plus. The bowl of bacon was what sparked my interest in the first place and I finally got to try it. They serve it with maple syrup... it was DIVINE!Drinks are well priced and the bartender was very friendly.Best part about this place is the clientele. You'll see everything from lawyers to college kids, to old Chinese men, to tourists looking to get away from Canal street.

I love that the calorie counts are listed for all dishes (and drinks). My favorites are: Art's Unfried Chicken--the sauce on the brussels sprouts and squash is finger licking good (i actually want to lick the plate clean...) and the breaded chicken is juicy and flavorful and the goat cheese and mushroom pizza is also excellent--the crust is superb. The space is quite spacious and inviting; however, this seems to lead to the entire restaurant being nearly empty every time I visit. I'm concerned that they're not doing enough business to stay solvent.

I was in shock how insanely delicious the soup was...hands-down this was one of the most delicious soups I have ever tried. The service was great too. The music was beyond horrible; it was almost as if the owner was making fun of us by demonstrating that he could play the worst music ever, and yet we would still wait on line to eat his soup. Part of me felt like a detainee at Guantanamo Bay being exposed to enhanced interrogation techniques (I did not break).

I had ZERO yoga experience and had to look around the entire time to avoid looking the part. The class was well-paced for beginners, with Erin focusing her attention on everyone getting into the correct positions. In a way, it felt like a private yoga class in a room of 20 people practicing downward dog!I loved the class so much, I quickly booked my second visit!

716,13,10,5.0,"After three different feasts here, I've gotta weigh in. I'm pretty shocked that a place sitting on the infamous St. Marks gauntlet can be so authentically executed. Every staff member I've encountered there has been extremely professional and respectful. The decor is cute without being cliche, and yet still classy. Even with people clustered around the door waiting for tables, they somehow manage to keep the atmosphere cozy and not too crowded/loud. This in itself is a huge feat for this area of the East Village. I originally stopped in to try the xiao long bao (soup dumplings). I've now tried all variations- crab, wasabi, super spicy, and kung fu (regular). They are all delicious, but be prepared to have your entire mouth on fire with the super spicy. I have never met my match in spiciness until I put those in my mouth. Don't get so distracted by the xiao long bao that you don't try other things. Some musts: pork knuckle soup (amazing), the leek with pork, spicy eggplant, peashoots, wood ear, and mapo tofu. There is some controversy amongst my dining friends about the mapo tofu- The Bao decided to make it vegetarian, and some people insist that it would just be so much better with pork. Let's be real, most things are, but I still think it's pretty delicious. This is one of the few Chinese places that I feel like I could visit again and again and still discover new delicious things. Also, you can tell they don't ""cheapen"" the dishes by just adding MSG or corn starch.

Straddling the Upper East Side and East Harlem, Earl's gets bonus points in my book for its proximity to the Metro North underground/above ground transition. Transit nerd pro-tip: If you wait to watch a southbound train go by, you can wave to the conductor, and he'll most likely wave back! I was way too excited about this interchange.So the latest big news is that they have EXPANDED! This tremendously popular place is no longer the size of a thimble. There is now an open back room with I think 5 more large tables, so I no longer have to restrict my visits to summer off-hours.I've tried a few things on the creative menu, but have settled on the mac and cheese, which always allures with its creamy decadence and sprinkles of rosemary. I also like Earl's Taco, which combines slow cooked meat with flecks of Mexican cheese, a cabbage slaw, and a delicious hot sauce. The taco comes on a scallion pancake, which I think is brilliant, and lends a uniquely satisfying texture and thickness to the dish.There are a lot of faux-hipster/creative/foodie restaurants (Supply House, I'm looking at you) on the Upper East Side that don't deliver, and are merely trying to cash in on a trend, but Earl's Beer and Cheese is the real deal.",9,0.9847

The eggplant and BBQ chicken flatbreads were delish, everyone at the table loved it. The pepper appetizer, crab cake and the tagliatelle were all really good.

721,19,12,5.0,"I have to tell you, after the trying experience I had at another establishment this week, tonight was a breath of fresh air. Hubby and I made reservations for my girlfriend's birthday weekend. We were late, as per usual but Angel, the manager, greeted us and accepted us in with open arms. From the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and my girlfriend and her boo were already at the bar sampling some of their amazing cocktails. The dining area is intimate and the decor is sexy. This is a perfect date night spot. They sat us at our table and we were overwhelmed by the menu items. We ordered the Calamari, Short Rib Arepas and Hamachi Ceviche for our apps. Let me tell you that I've never had calamari with maduras (sweet plaintains) but OMG they were amazeballs! The arepas were bomb as was the hamachi dish. My girlfriend and her love ordered the Parillada to share, which included Ribeye, Chorizo, Morcilla Arepas, Short Rib and Bone Marrow...yes. Bone Marrow. Hubby had the Arroz con Pollo and I went with the Paella de Mar. Everything was spectacular. While we ate, the table next to us was also having a birthday celebratory dinner but the birthday boy went to the bathroom right before they arrived at the table with his dessert and sparklers. When the staff realized what happened, they quickly grabbed everything, went back to the kitchen and presented the birthday boy again. They kicked butt in the customer service department. The wine list is a perfect size. They have a nice selection. We went with an Albariño and enjoyed every last drop. When it was time to surprise my girlfriend with her birthday dessert, they also hooked us up with comped champagne. I have to tell you that they made us feel like regulars, despite the fact that we've never stepped foot through their door before tonight.

722,20,10,5.0,"A bonafide, awesome cocktail bar in the East Village, Dead Drop is a must-try on the cocktails bar list. This is probably one of my new favorite speakeasy spots, next to places like Angel's Share and Little Branch. Admittedly, I would hate to reveal too much. It is a spot to check out though if you want quality service and very well made drinks, a low-key, sexy yet simultaneously casual atmosphere. I will say in short that there is very little to dislike.Located inside the North River restaurant in the East Village, go down the small set of stairs upon entrance. A button on the wall will call for the hostess, who should open the door promptly. It is first-come, first-serve basis, so obviously you will want to come earlier than later if you want to avoid the wait. Not a very large place, but accommodates just the right amount of people for a good night's crowd without being obnoxious. I love the red walls and the dark, intimate, and super cozy atmosphere it creates. Two bartenders man the tiny bar at the front, but this tiny bar has a lot to offer. What is great is the breakdown of their menu, which displays 'Yet To Be Classified', 'Recently Classified', to 'From the Archives'. Under these categories is the classification of 'Lethal' and 'Lively'. Lethal, is of course, the stronger of the cocktails. Lively is the refreshing/lighter ones. I started off with a lethal Red Orchestra (Gin, Kumaru, Maraschino, Cherry Brandy, and Celery Bitters). This was an excellent stiff cocktail yet not peaty and smooth to the last drop. Second drink was the classic yet lethal Martinez from the archives (Old Tom Gin, Sweet Vermouth, Maraschino, Boker's, and Orange Bitters). Again, while it was a lethal martini, it was very tasty and easy to take down with each sip. Service was excellent too, as one of the bartenders/servers was very helpful in providing input. I will definitely be returning to Dead Drop soon. Bring a friend or two, a date, and you should not be disappointed. Do not be shy going for the lethal cocktails either. They are all tasty and will be worth it in the end.",22,0.9953

And I didn't expect I could watch him at such close quarters. While I managed to snag front-row seats, the performance conjures up the intimate setting of 19th century parlor magic regardless of where you are seated.  Steve's portfolio of tricks included Think-A-Drink--a tea kettle that produced five different drinks, all at the audience's request, and also mind reading (really?), and cards.

You walk all the way to the back where someone prepares the food fresh in front of you. The ingredients they use is really fresh as you can see from my photos and they prepare it very quickly as well. I got a Chicken taco and an El Pastor taco which we so delicious and exploded with flavor!

Once you walk into Sakagura it crazy how the restaurant went from 0 to 100. It feel like you are walking into a restaurant that located in Japan. The quality of all the fish is amazing and the portion is definitely enough for someone to get full off of. From looking at the picture we had to order the Sakagura: Lunch Tasting Course. We decided that the Sakagura: Lunch tasting course will be out appetizer. Then we also ordered the Una Don($17.00) and Higawari Set ($11.50). Sakagura: Lunch Tasting Course start off with a appetizer with 5 kinds of sashimi. Then came the main course of assortment tempura (shrimp, white fish and vegetable), Grilled Fish, Beef Fillet Steak, and Cold Handmade Soba. (Cost: $33) The freshest and best tasting sashimi that I have had in NYC. The beef fillet steak was really amazing and something I would just order by itself next time. The shrimp inside the shrimp tempura was huge and not just tempura. I think that the Sakagura: Lunch Tasting Course makes a great appetizer for two so that you can try a large assortment of food. The Una Don was huge! This is probably the first time that I was unable to finish my food at a sushi restaurant. For lunch the Una Don came with a full serving of Eel in a large bowl of rice. The rice and eel was both covered in eel sauce which was amazing and tasty. We also ordered the Higawari Set which was a part of the valentine week special that Sakagura was offering. The service is amazing. The waiter was very attentive and was on point with refilling water and tea.

Bleh. The barista also told me if I wanted a less acidic taste that I should go with iced coffee. The decision was a good one - some of the freshest, not so bold, yet not too watery iced coffee I've had for a while. I'm usually a fan of Gregory's Coffee iced coffee and this one comes out even or even tops it.

But when I got a last minute notice that The Jewbadours were going to be at this location in Harlem.... I jumped out of bed and rushed over about 1/2 hour after the start of the show. I figured what the heck, if they're done, at least I can get something to eat. I'm so glad I did. Yo, seriously Halem Dinosaur... you need to talk to your sister Gowanus. She's making y'all look bad. Everything I had a problem with there, was perfect here. Dinosaur's greens are always great. Exactly like homemade. No stems, great spice, only thing missing is pieces of ham hock. The Chicken (dark meat)/Ribs Combo was perfect. Came from the kitchen hot enough to still be warm while I was too busy recording the Jewbadours playing. And the Mac & Cheese! How could it be so different from the one in Gowanus??? The best one I've had in a long time. I had some hiccups with service, but since I'm proactive and not a person who complains all the time (really... I don't!) the thing that tipped the experience over to 5 stars was the Jewbadours. I live for live music. Live for it. So the fact that there's a little stage over by the bar with regular live music will definitely get me to come back. Even if it's just for drinks (if the pina colada machine is working next time I will be ecstatic. See... I don't complain...).The two ladies next to me were ready to throw their heyzelekh at the stage. They were killing all the Blue-eyed Soul standards of the 70s. All of them! Hopefully Yelp will actually upload my video this time, but it doesn't do them justice.

Our waiter was courteous, friendly and attentive without being intrusive. We enjoyed the comforts of the Talay fried rice and the Tamarind chicken. Not being a huge fan of Thai food, I must admit that I was actually shocked at how well both dishes were executed along with their presentation. The Talay fried rice contained a delicate balance of seafood which was tender, well seasoned and only slightly spicy. I quite gladly bypassed their drinks to savor all of the complex flavors. With hesitation I contemplated trying my company's Tamarind chicken. I was afraid to throw off the wonderful balance from my palate. But I am glad I didn't pass up the chance to sneak a bite of that crispy, savory-sweet tamarind chicken.

I was actually excited to find out that they also just started selling their product out of the Little Muenster stall in Hudson Eats, which is another major win for the extremely ice cream deprived neighborhood of Battery Park City.The abundance of flavors makes up for the lack of cones or other vehicles for trying them, as they are so complex and fun to try, that it works in just a cup. Milk Money and Basic B are two of their most incredible flavors, which I had the pleasure of getting from Little Muenster last week, so on this initial visit to the shop I had to try 6 other flavors (I know, I have a problem). Look at how unique the ingredients are in some of these:- Shade (Smoked Dark Chocolate, Caramelized White Chocolate Ganache)- 9AM (Vietnamese Coffee, Donut Truffle)- Movie Night (Buttered Popcorn, Toasted Raisin, Dark Chocolate Flakes)- Nuts of Wrath (Marcona Almond, Grape Kool-Aid Jam)- Three Little Pigs (Salted Caramel, Bacon Butter, Bacon Praline)- Mahjong (Jasmine Tea Leaf, White Peach, Peach Lambic)Those first 3 flavors blew me away. Each was more incredible than the other, and I couldn't decide which was the best of the batch. The last 3 were much more of an acquired taste. You really need to like bacon to enjoy the Three Little Pigs, as it super bacon-y, and you really need to like the taste of alcohol in your ice cream to enjoy the Mahjong. I'm not the biggest fan of these two concepts in ice cream, but they were still delicious actually.This is an amazing addition to the neighborhood, and fills a major ice cream void as well (all we really had previously was Chinatown Ice Cream Factory a little further north, and maybe Mo II Gelato for another good option). This is definitely my new go to in this area, and I am excited to see all of the stuff coming soon.",56,0.9979

736,9,6,5.0,"Freemans was one of the first and most memorable places I visited in NYC right before moving there a couple months later. I was looking for a place to have brunch with my family for my birthday and was drawn to this place in particular because of the lovely rustic decor and the fact that it was ""hidden"" and off the beaten path. I will never forget turning a corner and walking down that very unassuming urban alley that leads to a tiny rustic entryway. One minute I was in New York and the next I was somewhere much more remote. The interior is stunning. I am a sucker for atmosphere and this place really did a great job in that department. There is lot of warmth, wood, flora, and taxidermy. It's simple, rustic, and reminiscent of an old world hunting lodge or farm house. The menu is great and offers a nice variety of simple, hearty, American fare. Downstairs was a little more tightly packed, but we were seated upstairs, which was less busy and had more room to spread out since we were a larger group. The food was fantastic and everyone enjoyed their meal, adults and kids alike. The brunch cocktails were great as well, and the prices were very reasonable. I've returned one other time just for drinks downstairs. Unfortunately, that time the service was not very good because our bartender was not very nice, but I won't hold that against them since my last experience was excellent all around. I would recommend Freemans for a variety of occasions. It's great for brunch with friends, but at night I would imagine it is super romantic and, therefore, would probably make for a great date night spot. I can't wait to come back for dinner!",14,0.9963

It had a lot of flavors going on but all came together nicely: spinach, dill, noodles, crispy garlic (especially this, yum!) and then some. We also split the stew of the day which was an awesome shredded chicken dish with very royal rice and sour cherries. I love how the menu changes often because I believe any kind of experimentation coming from this joint is a good one. $20 for both items and healthy portion sizes, too. There is something special going on here for sure.",11,0.9923
739,8,4,5.0,"Best place for new dim summers! I've been coming here for about 20 years and have brought many new comers along the way. I promise you that it will impress! The place is massive with a big escalator bringing you to the large banquet hall, which is actually used as an event space and sectioned off for weddings and such. It's size, atmosphere, and food are all very impressive!When you are seated, you will receive a card for your table that servers will stamp when you order a dish that is small, medium, or large. As the servers push the carts by, you will see an array of mainly southern Cantonese style small dishes. You will point out which you want, they give you the dish, and stamp your card. Easy as that! When you are stuffed and cannot eat anymore, take that card and head to the cashier by the escalators to pay your bill. Tip is left on the table. Food! here are the staples that we can't dim sum without:-ha gao: (shrimp dumpling)-Sui mai: (pork dumpling)-cheong fun: shrimp in think rice noodle)-(spare ribs on thick rice noodle)-wu gok: (fried taro)-cha Siu bao: (roast pork bun)-lo Mai gai: (sticky rice)-Dan tat: (egg custard tart) for dessertFew other quick tips:- Cantonese call dim sum ""yum cha"" which means to drink tea. So when your tea runs low, take the top of the teapot and tilt it. That will let your servers know it's time for a refill!- there is a buffet style setup along the long wall that will have your more interesting food items. We're talking snails, stomach, fish balls, and also some killer veggies- get here before 11:00 to avoid the rush!!!my only complaint is that they recently started trying to jump in on the NYC boozy brunch scene by offering a bar cart with mimosas served by Americans.

I'm always on the lookout for great Japanese spots and am surprised that the opening here didn't get more fanfare. In addition to being able to order a la carte, Domodomo offers what is probably one of THE most reasonably priced tasting menus in New York: 1. 6 courses for $302. 8 courses for $45 3. domokase 10 courses (+5 sushi pieces) for $68I got the last option,which I thought was just a little too much food, but as always my eyes were bigger than my stomach. Highlights included the truffle chawanmushu, jumbo oyster, eel and katsuo sashimi (comes with an awesome mango salsa). The one noticeable item that isn't on any of the set menu's is the uni pasta, so next time I think I'll go with the middle option and pasta to share.One of my main gripes with Asian restaurants in general is that dessert is often forgotten about, and every restaurant will offer some sort of green tea ice cream or cake and call it a night. So I was pleasantly surprised with the hojicha pudding, which had just a hint of sweetness and a great smoky flavor.Edit: they now also offer a sushi course!

743,6,6,5.0,"What a wonderful wonderful place to go to for brunch!I have to admit, I'm not big into going out for brunch, because most places I have been to have just been a disaster, and it was just cheap and disappointing. But off a drunk late night whim a.k.a. great idea when you're drunk but terrible idea to try to wake up sober/hungover....it was definitely something memorable!I made reservations (drunk the night before) for 4, and a 5th person decided to join us last minute, which they were able to accommodate for about 12:30.There was a good crowd still, and yet it seemed like the service was fully concentrated on our table, and only our table.The food was impeccable, the trout hollandaise was the most perfect combination of crispy, creamy, salty, that I have had. It sounded so good that 3 out of 5 of us ended up getting it. YUMMMM!!The escargot were piping hot, perfectly seasoned, not overly salty. Perfect accommodation to the bread basket that they kept on bringing. The oysters, unfortunately were out of a few types but we ended up trying other types that were fresh and delicious as well.The bloody mary's were made with love, garnished with pretty lemon, lime, celery, and even olives. And they weren't stingy with the alcohol, definitely hangover cure! I even tried my cousins mimosa and is was made with fresh juice as well.And I guess my cousin has been there before where she said hi to the owner, and he must've overheard that it's her birthday brunch, so he sent us over free dessert and coffee as well.Just a wonderful experience and even though this was about a month ago, it was such a great time that I remembered it just like it was yesterday!

744,9,8,5.0,"The Quick: A fantastic hole in the wall spot for roast pork over rice with cabbage for $3.50 which is so tasty. If you don't trust me, trust the line down the block at all times (moves quickly).The Details: As with all my favorite hole in the wall restaurants, I like to be very upfront right away. There are no chairs in this restaurant, it is take out only. This is actually a good thing because the line is always down the block (full of locals) and yet it moves quickly. We just walk to the park near by to enjoy our meal outside comfortably. As far as I know there's only one or two options on the menu, and the staff speaks very little English. Just get whatever everyone else is getting because it's cheap, it's greasy, and it's delicious.This place deserves its 5 star rating based on quality of food for the price. It cannot compete in venue, atmosphere, or presentation to a more expensive restaurant. However the food is extremely good and the flavor profile is different than your average meal. In this price range it's a great alternative to a fast food chain and more filling than a slice of pizza. My boyfriend and I split the roast pork and the 5 dumplings from Prosperity Dumpling for $1 (see my other review) and felt very satisfied for a late lunch.

Give me a half of all of your three rolls and then throw some extra stuff in! That's how you take a visit to Maine in a NY second. The lightly toasted buttered roll buns grace the nicely chilled lobster, shrimp, and crabmeat, all of which is in itself buttered with a delicious garlic dressing soaked throughout. The texture of the meat isn't rubbery, but fresh also.Well Luke decided all that wasn't enough. So he added in a couple claws for a couple more dollars because he's that type of guy.(sigh) To be frank, that description isn't really doing the best job of describing what Luke is selling. How do you describe 'love' to a person who has never experienced it? See what I mean? So that brings me to my suggestion/solution.TAKE YOUR TAIL OVER TO LUKE'S LOBSTER AND GRAB A ROLL, OR TWO, OR THREE. Then again, just going for a visit to Maine isn't a bad idea.

Although I loved the tuna, the bread was a little hard to eat in my opinion. Perhaps it's because I just suck at biting bread but if it were on a panini or something easier to bite, it would be my all time favorite sandwich. The tuna is perfectly mixed with veggies like carrots and peas giving it that ""crunch"". It helps to break up that tuna-y taste that sometimes gets old pretty quickly.

749,11,6,5.0,"I recently took advantage of the opportunity to see One World Observatory prior to its actual opening. I was excited from the second I chose my tour time. Everything here is very organized, the entrance is separate from the employee entrance (which is smart) and there is staff EVERYWHERE to help you along the way. I promise you cannot and will not get lost. Once you're inside, you go down the escalator, they check your ticket, and you go through TSA-type security. Be prepared to take off your belts and empty your pockets!Once you're through security, you wait for the elevator that everyone has been talking about. It's no joke. You get to the 102nd floor in a matter of seconds and on the way up you see the city being built from farmland to what it is today. Your ears will also pop at the end. The 102nd floor has a small theater where you watch a quick visual of NY today and there is a little surprise at the end (I won't give that away). You eventually make your way down to the 100th floor which has 360 views, meaning you can see the city, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Lady Liberty, etc etc. Tons of photo ops on all the floors! Even though it was overcast when we went, you could still see pretty far out.There is also the Sky Portal which you can walk on. It looks like you could fall through at any moment so it's a bit of a mind f*ck but it's awesome nonetheless. There is also a restaurant and a gift shop (which I disagree with but whatever). If you want to see a beautiful building and experience pretty much all of NYC, you should definitely come here once it opens on May 29th. Also the video in the elevators going down IS totally different and if you typically experience motion sickness, this might not be for you.

We got two orders of guacamole ($4.50 on tues) which has about a cup guacamole, a cup of salsa, and a huge basket of chips... So all that times two, calamari ($5) which was HUGE-- looked like two orders at any other restaurant, yuca fries ($5) which are AMAZING but are not on the half off menu, Latina salad ($8) which was also not on the half off menu but it was a really good portion, and a diet coke & a tea which was A LOT of food for the price.The second experience I had here was MUCH better even though the first visit was still good (and a really good deal). I came here with a couple of friends on a Saturday night around 7:45. We got drinks at the bar ($7 for tequila on the rocks) while we waited for only about 5 minutes for our table. We got guacamole ($9), taquitos de pescado ($13), salmon ceviche ($12), and pulpo ala plancha ($12). The high lights were the Taquitos and the ceviche.

My bartender was extremely sweet and attentive. I never had to track him down to order a drink. He was ALWAYS on top of it. I believe his name is Jamison but don't quote me on that. I ordered the shrimp dumplings which were great. I love dumplings so anytime I see them on the menu I have to order them. This place fills up fast after 5pm.

It's light and creamy and comes with ginger and salt, but I like it plain.Grilled Squid: Nicely cooked, not overdone, and tender.Takowasa: The takowasa at Hagi was always my favorite but this one tops it! It has a ton of flavor and just the right amount of wasabi (I like it spicy). I liked the radish mixed into the octopus. Also, the octopus was fresh.I love the ambiance here.

Everything is organized neatly and symmetrically. Everything is taken care of with utter diligence. There is a department for everything, even for lighting. This is my favorite place in the world. Go up the grand stairs. Make sure to don't miss out on the Egyptian and Roman wings. Look at the wonderful Van Gogh paintings; they are thoughtfully placed with the Gauguin ones.

754,11,12,5.0,"Summary: Siggy's is a terrific spot for comfort food with gourmet flare, smoothies and juices, and a menu that offers something for everyone but that'll make vegans and vegetarians especially happy. If you've been to Siggy's original Brooklyn location, the menu here mostly overlaps with the one there, but the space here is maybe two or three times bigger and more stylish. Though the original location is cozy and a swell space to eat in, the new Siggy's feels more refined, somehow more like a restaurant. You could come here with friends or family, but it'd work for casual dates too. All the produce used is organic and, maybe more importantly, all the meat is sourced well (e.g. the beef is pastured). Infinite plus points.Misc details:* The macaroni n' cheese is excellent. The whole wheat pasta has more body and feels more substantial than plain pasta, and the cream & cheese sauce turns your mouth into a gooey wonderland. My friends and I split this four ways and had it as an appetizer.* The soup--black-eyed peas, tomatoes, and celery--was equally great. It's a daily special, but if you like hearty vegetable soups and this is available, you'll like this.* Salmon burger w/ feta on brioche--solid. They were two sizeable patties side by side, and they paired well with the feta, smeared onto the toasted bun. I liked this but I hear the turkey burger here is phenomenal, and the beef burger is all pastured-beef (as is all the beef served here), and I was left wishing I'd maybe tried one of those.* The raspberry tart! As with the BK location, this is the best dessert. It's crispy, tart, sweet, and leaves you impressed that it's vegan. It's not huge, but big enough to split two ways easy, or even three or four ways, if you want more of an amuse-bouche-y dessert.* Siggy's has a small selection of organic beers--the Pinkus wheat lager is sweeter than most beers, but if you're okay with that it's a very good hefeweizen.* It's also the sort of place that has theme-appropriate political flyers up in the bathrooms. Did you know that Monsanto is suing Vermont because Vermont passed a law mandating all G.M.O. foods be labeled as such? I did not know this but I do now. Now, you might not worry about genetics and crops, reasoning that it's silly to worry about any such thing when we're all doomed anyway, what with the seas rising and the advent of the AI overlords nearly upon us! So you might just go to Siggy's to enjoy wholesome food before that happens. And that's okay. The politics don't get in the way of the eating.",18,0.9984

I looked at my friend and asked if he was sure that it was that good! Not just white people...white people eating rolls. Rolls?! WTF. Likely they were freakin' California rolls! I was definitely not confident that it would be a great meal. I'm white and listen, there's nothing wrong with white people eating at awesome sushi spots but I was just taken aback as usually when I go to ""authentic"" sushi spots, there are not many white people at all (like 1-2 max).I was also surprised to see a mixologist behind the sushi counter in this small little bar area. He made me a great cocktail with soju vodka, yuzu juice, peychaud bitters, and simple syrup. It was quite strong and different but very tasty. We ordered the omakase (chefs choice) that had 8-ish prepared/cooked dishes to start (can't remember), followed by 10-ish courses of omakase sushi. I forgot the exact numbers but whatever, you get the point.Are you ready to start this magical journey with me?Prepared dishes:+ Leek soup - This was like straight out of a 3-Michelin starred restaurant.

BEST PIECE OF MEAT I HAVE EVER CONSUMED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. Do I need to repeat this? Make bold letters and stars when you are taking notes about this. Legit, the best. It melted in my mouth.*******+ Mochi rice (risotto) with uni and truffles - Is this for real?! Seriously. Come on guys, you can stop trying now. The sushi pieces were quite heavenly as well. Very fresh and VERY good.We ended with the peanut butter ice-cream (THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT I AM OBSESSED WITH ALL THINGS HAVING TO DO WITH PEANUT BUTTER) and I can definitely say that I was in heaven. For a good 2 hours, I was sitting in heaven.Neta definitely ranks within the top 2 sushi restaurants in NYC in my book and I have been to pretty much all of the top sushi restaurants in the city.

758,15,4,5.0,"Threw my big 30th birthday bash at The Winslow and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out! Pros:* One of the nicer bar lounges on 14th street with an elegant, warm, and unpretentious atmosphere. * Winslow is perfect for large parties- I reserved the semi-private room in the back that can hold up to 35 people max. When 65 people ended up coming, the room obviously became super cramped so many ventured out into the main bar space, which was totally fine. If I were to do this again with the same number of people, I would reserve the 1-2 additional tables right next to the semi-private room. * The best part about The Winslow was the excellent service. Unlike similar lounges like Stanton Social or Verlaine's, The Winslow is one of the few, if not only, slightly higher-end Manhattan bars that do not require an initial deposit, a crazy minimum charge, and one or limited tabs for parties. They also offer open bar specials, but I decided to go with the easier cash/credit bar! * Keiran, one of the managers, was so nice and easy to work with. He always replied to my emails promptly whenever I had any questions. When he mistakenly informed me the Happy Hour ended at 8PM (when it was 7PM), he still kept his promise for my group. They were so easy-going that they let me re-arrange the furniture in the semi-private space. Rory was sweet and friendly, and all my friends were happy with how quickly he came back with our drink orders, especially when he was our only server. Throughout the night, both Kieran and Rory made sure to ask me how my friends and I were doing. * The food here is delicious! I ordered several party platters (which you order 2 days before your event), which my friends loved! The winning hors d'oeuvres that night were the Pigs in a blanket, Goat cheese and fruit compote, Deviled eggs with crispy bacon, Grilled cheddar and tomato sandwiches, and Smoked Salmon Crumpets. * The Winslow is known more for their gin cocktails. I gravitate towards fruitier and sweeter drinks, so I loved the Garden of Eden $11 (Gin, St. Germaine, Lime/Lemon). Happy Hour Specials:Cocktail of the day - $7Gin and Tonic of the day - $7Draft beer - $5Wine - $5Post-Happy Hour:Cocktails - $10-$12Beers - $5-$8Wines - $8-12* During busy nights Fri-Sat- they had DJ sessions starting around 10PM. The electronic music was fun and not over-the-top brash like dubstep. * My GF surprised me with a birthday cake, and without any extra charge The Winslow added big sparkers on top and brought out plates and cutlery for everyone.

It's a large, buttery, flakey and chewy shell encompassing all the good qualities of naan, Chinese scallion pancake (minus the scallion), and phyllo dough. It's crunchy on the outside, yet chewy enough to sop up all the delicious juices without falling apart.I got the lamb shoulder, which comes with tzatziki sauce and eggplant salsa. It was total perfection: the shredded lamb was tender, juicy, and flavorful (garlic baby!!), while the sauce gave it a decadent, creamy component and the salsa a fresh crunch. Although it was a single taco, I was quite satisfied after finishing it. If I didn't have upcoming dinner plans I would've wanted to try all the other tacos!My tastebuds are still salivating from the taco as I write this review.

761,14,9,5.0,"Japanese-style crêpes are still very much alive, kicking, and trending. It's Spicebox Crêpes's balance of quality, price and location that gives them the nod for our overall rating of 4.5/5.0This crêpe concept first landed in L.A. around 2005, and made it's way to NYC in 2013. Spicebox opened on Pell St., in the heart of Chinatown in October 2014, so they're still relatively new to the neighborhood. They have (reportedly) 5 locations including 3 in Guangzhou (China), 1 in Guangdong (China) and this new NYC outpost.One can't help but draw comparisons to other Japanese-style crêperies, (Eight Turn, T-Swirl, little known Big Bear) and traditional French crêperies. The timely conical shape preparation, while not all that difficult to execute is still an art and thus difficult to master. Savory or sweet, there's sure to be something for everyone either for breakfast, lunch, or snack to be shared. Made to order on-premises, the price point is comparably in the $7-10 range.I ordered the ""Tokyo in a Bite"" (Strawberries, red bean, green tea ice cream, pocky sticks, yogurt, chocolate sauce) which was easily my favorite of the whole menu, and ""Piece of New York"" (Blueberries, cheesecake, jam, whipped yogurt, house Nutella) and while these are different in their own right, they're just as tasty and fresh as their counterparts they're named after. They're Light, flavorful, and portable with their own handheld, tear off cardboard container to consume it in. The ingredients are fresh and complement each other well within the crêpe.I've also ordered a cappuccino or two and know that they offer a perfectly acceptable blend of standard coffee. This is actually a great place for me to duck into to get my caffeine fix while everyone else queues up at the other cafes. By the way, the cup and matching polar bear sleeve are ridiculously adorable!The space is fun and inviting, with colorful adornments throughout, and detailed hexagonal floor-tiling. A chalkboard menu keeps the menu dynamic, and the wall of crêpes adorning the window is a nod to the Japanese fake food motif.I'd like to see if they add to the menu as the weather gets warmer. Parfait and frozen yogurt sound good to me but hopefully something unique, original, and insanely Instagram-worthy.Spicebox may be an underdog in this space, but they're the ones to watch, as I expect they may be adding delivery and catering options to weather the seasonality of their product and target small businesses, too. As I don't enjoy venturing into neighboring NoLIta, their location within Chinatown is perfect for me, and ought to help them capitalize on tourist and local traffic.

762,11,10,5.0,"Woke up one morning and felt like my right ear was stuffed and could not hear so well, no other symptoms. Being your above average neurotic, I went to google and read about sudden sensorineural hearing loss (basically, sudden deafness that comes out of the blue). Then spent an hour watching youtube clips of doctors removing bugs and other unpleasant things from ears. After a day or so, with no change, I decided that I should probably seek the help of an ENT. Went to Castle Connolly (see my yelp review) and started calling doctors.  Luckily, I was able to get an appointment with Dr. Rothstein the next day (he accepts many different types of insurance). After booking the appointment I starting reading patient reviews and was happy to see that they were practically all glowing. I thought to myself, what are the chances of being able to get a next day appointment with a CC listed doc who accepts my insurance and has universally excellent reviews?!Went to see the doc the next day. Great modern/clean office located at the NYU Langone Medical Center. Turned out, no bugs, just a little impacted wax that he gently removed (no pain at all). I will be the first to admit, I'm a bit of a doctor snob; stellar credentials and a decent bedside manner mean a lot to me. I also like to see doctors that have been PRACTICING medicine for a long time (but not too long). Dr. Rothstein exceeded my expectations in every respect. Not only does he have a good professional reputation, he is a heimishe guy who made me feel very much at ease. I highly recommend him if you are in need of an ENT.PS: The entire consultation I was thinking of this scene:  youtu.be/dwswnuTvSMIPPS: It is a great feeling to be able to hear perfectly out of both my ears again.

The fancy lighting and interior design was beautiful but much more than we are used to. We checked-in and were given wrist bands that magically opens a locker. Lockers hold a bathrobe, towel and slippers so all you need is your bathing suit! What stood out immediately was how friendly, helpful and welcoming the staff was. There were women working in the locker room making sure we all knew what to do and they brought us down to the pools when we were ready. We thought it would be relatively empty as our time slot was 9-11 pm (!!) on a Tuesday night but it was full!Oh my dear lord...the pools. A salt water pool, a very hot pool (102 degrees), a freezing cold pool with ice chunks (53 degrees), a jet whirl pool, a pool in back that we called the ""grotto"" because it was hidden and dark and cave-like. And then the steam room - the most incredible steam room I've ever encountered, enclosed in a glass room with aromatherapy.We tried each pool quickly to figure out which we liked best. And then we had TWO HOURS to relax, float, and breathe deeply. Yes, as others have said, most people here are couples and people did seem to get very touchy feely, which might make some uncomfortable. I just ignored them and enjoyed myself. We had also booked 15 minute massages, which were wonderful and much too short, although I'm glad because that gave us more time to spend in the wonderful pools (massage time is included in your two-hour time slot).This is the perfect romantic date or special occasion celebration. It is very expensive so it's perfect for a treat. I had the best time and would recommend it to everyone I know. Book far in advance as they get quite busy!",20,0.9982
765,19,10,5.0,"In Parerga und Paralipomena, Arthur Schopenhauer relates a parable of porcupines huddling together in winter for warmth, inevitably pricking each other in the process. After several instances of this, the porcupines finally settle on a distance wherein their collective heat remains a resource (albeit less than ideally), but without the fear of being jabbed by one another's quills. This behavioral framework eventually became known as the 'Hedgehog's Dilemma' and a quote within the parable came to be known as an early reference to man's tendency toward isolationism. ""A man who has some heat in himself prefers to remain outside, where he will neither prick other people nor get pricked himself.""Rebelle and Pearl & Ash are sister restaurants, and, on first glance at least, should by the above parable be inextricably intertwined in their respective bloodstained quills. Yet somehow, in a separation of but a few feet, and while sharing a theme, the two restaurants remain distinct, and each serves to strengthen the other. Rebelle, on its conceptual surface, is the sort of inchoate culinary rebellion that entices talented chefs who tire of classical haute cuisine. It is not a renouncement of necessary skill, but, rather, a recognition of the creative possibility (and risk) of a greater degree of freedom. Serious food in a more casual setting. While some may roll their eyes at the idea of yet another Per Se expat using moderately larger tweezers to arrange moderately smaller plates, that isn't the sort of apostasy Rebelle incites or contributes to. Rebelle is instead the closest place to a New Wave Parisian bistro outside of, well, Paris. Bistros in Paris have gradually come to be reclaimed by a young generation of prodigious talents, seeking to deal less in faste, and more in fantasque. The man chosen to head the kitchen of Rebelle, Daniel Eddy, formerly the chef at Spring (in Paris), was unsurprisingly a figure of that movement. It should come as no shock then that a good number of the dishes are cleverly altered renditions of French culinary history and technique. Beets Bourguignon retain the earthy savoriness of the requisite mushrooms and subtle sweetness of the equally obligatory carrots, but treads on an altogether lighter plane, and rather than mentally prepare you for a long winter, it leaves you contemplating the approaching luminance of summer. In a nod to the almost fanatical precondition of acceptance of a bistro's quality, the pork headcheese is a showcase in charcuterie skills. Of the desserts, not ordering the cherry clafoutis would be a mistake. (Yes, they're done by a Per Se expat. No, you shouldn't roll your eyes.)Wine, much as at Pearl & Ash, is unimpeachable. As should be expected, the list at Rebelle skews slightly more French than its predecessor, in keeping with the theme. That said, the sheer breadth of obscurity, affordability, and amazing finds - French or otherwise - leave the list at either restaurant as unparalleled in the city. The by the glass offerings are reasonably priced and serve as a suitable lens through which to view the list, often featuring wines that don't normally see that sort of exposure. The sommeliers are much more well-versed in the 81 page tome than is reasonable, and like Patrick himself, are more invested in leading you to what you want to drink than in pushing trends. Rebelle, like its sister before it, is the epitome of what 'small plates' restaurants were envisioned capable of - cool, exciting, satisfying, and most of all, damned good fun.

767,17,6,5.0,"For my 400th review, I can say Rainbow Room is sufficiently worth reviewing. After a five year renovation closing, Rainbow Room reopens offering a Sunday brunch buffet ($95) and Monday night a la carte dining with live entertainment. In regards to brunch, it was certainly one of the most fanciful, yet fun white tablecloth brunch buffets I have experienced. Although I can't take credit for setting one, a reservation will prove a bit of a challenge (taken 60 days in advance, with few openings in between).Foremost, the space is simply captivating. Located on the 65th floor of 30 Rock, you are surrounded by breathtaking views of the city. An adjoining room provides the views alone. Take this opportunity for many photos. Vintage chandeliers, mirrored walls, crystal curtains, a circular dance floor, plus a live band, adorn and surround a large, impressive space that resonates a slight touch of contemporary with predominantly classic. Soft, grey colored walls provide a neutral palette for the decorative elements of tastefully done glitz and glamour. On to the dining, there is simply too much that can be covered in words when it comes to their buffet. A 360 degree buffet, labeled and separated into sections, provides an immense variety. You should be here for a good few hours, trying a little bit of every thing they offer. The buffet consists of, but is not limited to, a raw bar, sushi bar, a meat carving station, charcuterie of cheese and salumi, breads, pasta dishes, Asian-inspired dishes, pate varieties, and truffle and grits. There is also a crepes and desserts station to the other side. They nearly cover all types of food. Some dishes were admittedly better than others. My favorites -- the crepes, risotto, meat carving station, truffle and grits, and pate section. We managed to try a lot, yet not all, within a span of 3 hours. Seated around 2PM, we were officially stuffed by 5:30PM. Note: Take your time. No one will rush you. Soak in as much of the experience, and try as much of their food. You might not get this chance too often.Rainbow Room is a truly landmark, classy establishment with much to offer when it comes to dining and atmosphere. Do not neglect to dress to impress. Hardly pretentious at all, as some may think. All in all, superb time at the Rainbow Room. I would undoubtedly return and recommend others to try.",30,0.9931

771,9,8,5.0,"Finally after all these years I've found my people! As a Vietnamese-American used to having endless options in Houston, the lack of authentic Vietnamese restaurants was one of the things that made fully loving New York so difficult for me. In an admittedly diva-esque move, I literally left the last ""Vietnamese"" restaurant my friend suggested because it was way too Chinese (I couldn't even read the menu, the Vietnamese names for dishes were printed as some sort of subtext/translation to the Chinese name) and THANK GOODNESS I DID BECAUSE I FOUND THIS PLACE. For the first time since I moved to the city, I heard the waitstaff speaking my mother tongue. MUSIC TO MY EARS. We had the grilled pork summer roll (Goi Cuon Thit Heo Nuong) to start with. That's something I feel like you don't see on menus enough. The meat inside was actually warm like they had just grilled it right then. Then I had a Pho Tái, which was nothing mind-blowing (but still good, especially for these brutal NY winters). Their Chè Ba Màu is off the chain--shaved ice, beans, green jelly, and coconut milk, all topped with peanuts? What more could you want for a light, refreshing dessert? Best of all, THEY SERVE AVOCADO BOBA Y'ALL! Gosh Da Nang-it, why isn't this brilliant Southeast Asian move to make avocado sweet not available wherever tapioca balls are sold? I would say the only thing that isn't traditionally Vietnamese about this place is that the waitstaff is actually super friendly and the decor is great. There's really nothing bad about it. Now if only we could do something about the black ice and the summer smells, then I'd wholeheartedly love NY!",14,0.9901

The shishito pepper gives it a tiny oomph and the fish just melts in your mouth with the simple lemon dressing. -Dry-Aged Porterhouse Agnolotti $24: tender pieces of juicy steak wrapped up in house made macaroni. Probably my favorite pasta on the menu so far but I haven't had their lobster fra diavolo yet... Duhn duhn DUHNNNNN! -QI Baked Clams $16: probably the best variation of baked clams oreganata I have ever had. On each clam they broil on some pieces of capellini so they give the clams a tiny bit of crunchy texture. And to make things even more orgasmic, they drizzle on a delicious butter-lemon reduction sauce table side. Talk about a taste explosion! You know that amazing garlic bread they give you at the beginning? Save yourself a piece of this and use it to mop of the reduction sauce from this clam dish. You'll thank me later.Quality Italian Chicken Parmigiana (For Two) $29pp: think of it as a giant pizza pie-shaped chicken parm dish served with fresh arugula greens and honey with chili flakes on the side. Phenomenal. If you come with a group I highly recommend sharing this so you can all have a slice without dying from massive food coma.My favorite dessert option is the Cannoli Cart which is prepared tableside with tubes of fresh cannoli cream and freshly baked pastry shells. Every cannoli should be given to me this way! I also love the zagbaglione cream with fresh berries.

774,9,5,5.0,"I've been to Scarpetta at least 5 times during the last couple of years, and while I have certainly eaten at more inventive restaurants, I am compelled to give it 5 stars largely due to its consistency and the fact that I find myself back here time and time again. I have come here on a date, with friends, and with out of towners and parents. Reservations are not hard to come by if you are flexible with a 630PM or 930PM seating, and the location is in an easily accessible part of town.First off, the bread is not something to gloss over here. While at other places bread almost seems like a formality, at Scarpetta, bread is the first course. Their famed complimentary Stromboli, is served warm and with generous chunks of salami and mozzarella. I do not remember a single time when I did not ask for seconds and I admit I have gone to Scarpetta with precisely the intent of showing my dining companions how great it is.Appetizers are solid as well but if you are getting just one then it would have to be the Polenta. It is unbelievably creamy and the mushrooms add a great flavor to the dish. Scallops are seared well, but expensive at $21 for two small ones, and you are better off getting the Braised Short Ribs. Scott Conant is most famed for his simple spaghetti dish, which I tried on my first visit, but not again. Not to say it wasn't good, but I prefer the richness of the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli, or the sweetness of the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti. My boyfriend and I took my mom and her friend here two weeks ago, so we shared several pasta dishes, which I thought was the perfect way to try a bit of everything. The Foie Gras Ravioli in particular was well received by everyone.Mains are less exciting than the pastas but the Prime Sirloin of Beef is done very well and a good one to share. The Black Cod is not to be missed either.If you've left room for dessert, the Ganache Bar and Warm Banana Bread are both personal favorites. Service is attentive without being intrusive, and ambiance is beautiful. I definitely will be continuing to visit Scarpetta in the years to come.",17,0.9971

Ideally i'd like to come back, bring my laptop, do some work and look like a hipster in this coffee/sandwich shop.

I found their lunch menu more interesting. You could also customize the pasta type. We ordered the Brussels sprouts, wild boar ragu with pappardelle, sausage and pepper with garganelli and eggs Benedict and of course, the bottomless mimosas. The Brussels sprouts were crispy and the pancetta, pecorino and fuji apples paired well. I probably could have ate 4 more plates of it! Next, was the wild boar ragu. The pappardelle was thinner than other ones I have had, but I actually liked it more like this. The wild boar also was not gamey at all, which was my initial fear when ordering it. It was similar to pulled pork in texture and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the sausage and pepper pasta which was also good, but actually, I don't like bell peppers. If you really love bell peppers, get that dish. I did not get to try the eggs Benedict, but it did look good haha...Service was excellent. They were very friendly and made sure to fill up our mimosas like water! Even after we paid, they encouraged us to stay and drink some more. Awesome.The only downside of this place is the portions aren't too big and their dishes are so yummy that you might end up eating two entrees! That's how they get you with the nice prices I guess..

We're both ecstatic and mortified (there goes our diet) that this location is so close to home! Xi'an noodles every day!This location, compared to some of the older locations of Xi'an, is huge. The downstairs area hosts an open kitchen where you pick up your food, and at least 10 counter/bar seats to eat. This location even has an upstairs eating area complete with natural lighting through skylights (I've since learned that this area is closed unless the downstairs has run out of seating). There's plenty of space for everyone to enjoy their food and you won't have to hound people while they're eating to get a seat like the St. Marks, Midtown, or Chinatown locations. The ventilation here is also good and you won't smell like food for the rest of the day after eating here. Also, side note, this place isn't full of Xi'an propaganda, newspaper articles, and tv re-runs as the other places are.As with the other Xi'ans, my go-tos are""A1: Liang Pi - cold spicy noodles with gluen chunks - if you take it to go, make sure you ask for the sauce on the sideNS2: Spicy and tingly beef noodles in soupNS3: Mt. Qi pork noodle soup - diced pork with a sour/star anise soup baseNS4: Spicy pork noodles in soup**and anything in soup, really. The non-soup versions (same order number but without the ""s"") is good, but I always favor noodle soups!The hand-pulled (watch them make it!) noodles here are legit and it's hard to find this kind of al dente pulled noodle anywhere else in the city.PS: Take-out Xi'an never tastes as good as when you eat it in the restaurant.

I am pretty sure I have tried every doughnut shop in New York. After much research, these are without a doubt, the best in the entire city.After several stops at their stand at the Smorgasburg locations and at their original storefront in Bed Stuy, I have tried all of the many different flavors. They still seem to come up with new ones all the time though - I most recently discovered the filled Nutella doughnut for the first time here, and it blew my mind. This one and the other filled ones they have are smaller than the regular giant yeast ones, but pack even more flavor.You can't go wrong with any of these, but the Cafe Au Lait and Dulce de Leche are up there as the best of the bunch. If you love chocolate, then you will love my favorite ones, the Salted Chocolate Caramel or the Mocha with Crushed Almonds, which are so incredibly rich and chocolatey and gooey that you need to take a bath after eating them.You used to have to go line up at Smorgasburg or go to the remote shop in Bed Stuy to get your hands on these beauties, but now not only are they available at this much more accessible location, but are also showing up in nearly every coffee shop throughout both Manhattan and especially Brooklyn. They always seem a bit fresher from one of the storefront locations, but no matter where you get your hands on these, there's no denying how incredible they are.",43,0.9607

I came here on a Saturday afternoon, looking for a comfortable, non-pretentious place to drink some coffee (and, let's not lie, a mimosa or two); bum some free Wifi and work on a little blogging project; and hang out. I got everything I wanted and was tempted by some waffles along the way as well.At one point, I realized I'd had enough caffeine so switched to decaf refills. No problem. Then I ran out of battery juice and needed to plug in my laptop at the bar. No problem. Then when reaching for my mimosa, I knocked over the champagne flute and broke it, spilling the rest of my drink all over the bar. No problem. They were so nice, even with all of my bloopers.

I've seen many different things here, and the other night I saw a Lord of the Rings symphony while the movie played on a big screen above and behind the orchestra. It was so nice to be able to watch the movie and have the music played live. This is one of my top 10 favorite movies, and I'm so glad it was done justice by this performance. Every time I've been here though, whether it was for ballet or opera, I've always enjoyed the atmosphere and crowd. My one and only ""complaint"" is that you can't bring a drink inside unless it has a cap that you bought at the bar. So I had to chug my mimosa before going in and during intermission.",13,0.9738

Truthfully, I only noticed it because I was going to Totto Ramen and almost walked into the wrong place. I scoffed at the cahones of this place. Trying to compete with the infamous Totto Ramen? Pshh.. I felt sorry for this little fishAs a self diagnosed Ramen addict, I felt a duty to try Hide-Chan to see how it stacked against the rest, despite my allegiance to Totto. And you know what? It's now my favorite Ramen place in the city. First off, there's real seating here unlike Totto Ramen. I could have a real conversation with my co-worker, and didn't spend all my time trying not to fall of a stool. Ok, but in reality, those are minor details. I'd eat outside in the cold for a great bowl of Ramen. So onto the important stuff- first off, you have the choice of wavy or staight, extra firm, firm, medium or soft.Extra firm, wavy, spicy ramen with corn. Totto who?

I was at the Yelp Holiday Hangover cruise last night and Pucker was doing touchups for free so of course I decided to sign up.I did not expect anything more than a 5 minute touchup - maybe some eyeshadow and quick foundation. Instead, I got a full-blown 25-30 minute session with Julio who took his TIME with me. He painstakingly made sure that I looked my best and didn't overlook any detail. I seriously felt like he was a true artist who wanted to create the best work possible. After he was done, I was blown away at the results. He made sure the makeup looked natural and even with my super dry skin, nothing looked cakey! I was so happy, I was compelled to give him a huge hug afterwards. Because of the phenomenal service I received, I will be most certainly coming to the studio to get my makeup done for my engagement shoot. I took a look at their website and they had very reasonable prices, PLUS complimentary access to a dressing room and shower! Oh, and did I mention they donate 2% of their sales to charity?

Then they got that reggae stuff like mr vegas and every girl is droppin it down low and they don't care if you bump them cuz you drop it lower than them too. I didn't hear one song all night that I didn't love. Whoever the dj was is awesome!! And the drinks we're 9 bucks for well drinks. $10 for stolis. I was expecting 15 bucks to be honest.

I haven't ventured further into JWF than the bar, so I can't (and won't) provide insight on the vibe/space of the dining area... but the bar is where you want to be, as it allows you to interact with not only the bartenders but regulars who frequent this watering hole.I've had the burger and the fish & chips and may I say, both are solid choices that are well worth the price. The (HEFTY) burger was juicy, well-seasoned, and cooked to a perfect medium, while the fish & chips was perfectly light and crispy. By far, the best burger and fish & chips I've had in NYC to date. Note that they give you malt vinegar to eat with your fries; my boyfriend asked for (and was denied) ketchup...

Elbows resting on knees. Loose linen shirt billowing slightly in the breeze. Khaki shorts. Those ubiquitous fratbro Adidas slides. Not how I usually order my enchiladas, but hey.He springs up when he sees me. This is the second time I've ever spoken to him and the air is tinged with ""first meeting"" static, making even the people around us anxious and nervous.This is how we greet each other:Him: Hey!Me: Hey!Him: How are you!Me: Good! How are you?Him: How are you!i let his extra ""how are you"" linger in the autumnal air as we step inside the bar.

It is lively but not uncomfortably packed, and service is easy and smooth. I like this place.We stand by the wall for no more than a minute, waiting for seats to open. Suddenly, an entire bottle of wine falls off its place on the wall and lands beside my plastic-shoed date.The bottle shatters, bleeds out on the floor, wet shards of dark glass blinking up at us.A server swoops in and cleans up the gruesome sight with nary a word of blame or disdain. Euro-fresh is the best kind of fresh!We are seated at a slim counter and order a responsible (""aka, meagre!"" -21yo me) amount of wine. Red as a bodega macintosh.Polite conversation is had. No one is buzzed. Just two grown-ups living the euro-fresh life.We finish our wine and step out into the slightly frenetic fuzz that befalls Union Square at rush-hour.Bathed in the flattering halo of magic hour, we circle the block --my high-heeled boots syncopating with the flip-flap of his polymer slides.When we talk about this walk in the future, I will claim to barely remember it, and he will argue that it was the most shocking part of the date. According to him, without warning or provocation, I'd suddenly turned to him and said ""Wanna see my fake tooth?"" Then, before he could assert himself and say no, I allegedly reached into my mouth and pulled out one of my front teeth, glistening with saliva in the setting sun. He allegedly recoiled. I allegedly smiled proudly like a gap-toothed jack-o-lantern or a grizzled uncle returning from the Vietnam War.We circle back to the subway entrance at the bottom of Best Buy.

789,10,3,5.0,"IN SHORT: In a space along a street in Midtown that has undergone many a transformation in its lifetime, one can only pray that Betony, with its Michelin star food and service that makes you feel like you're sitting down for a meal in your living room, is here to stay for a while.THE STORY: In a world that seems to increasingly seek and embrace the singular superlative title of ""the best thing I ever ate,"" Betony slips quietly into the scene with its purely extraordinary piece of roasted chicken. This chicken is undoubtedly the best piece of chicken in New York. Sliced in a slender triangle and draped with seasonal vegetables like celery root sitting over a decadent jus, the chicken is impossibly soft and tender, like none I have ever had before, managing to occupy a buttery chicken flavor so perfectly fresh and pure. At my most recent meal here, all four members of our party ordered the chicken, and all four cleaned the plate so completely you would have thought it had never seen food.While a taste of this signature dish should not be missed, several other appetizers and small snacks deserve almost equal praise. At the top of this list is the hot foie gras, served next to pork belly in a hot ham broth. True to the rest of Betony's style, this piece of foie gras seems so simply executed at first, yet the purity of flavors does not belie a handsomely silky, rich, and perfectly textured bite. The Radicchio Tardivo, with beets and robiola bosina is another creamy yet light addition to the meal. With entrees ranging from $29-$43 and appetizers from $11-30, Betony is fitting for a superbly special meal that doesn't have to break the bank like a tasting menu easily could.Service is incredibly knowledgeable and calmly prepared to please to perfection. For our bread course, the pastry chef even prepared a phenomenal piece of gluten-free bread for our resident allergy-ridden guest, and our server was able to tell us the preparation of every dish to astonishing depth. It's the kind of subtle hospitality that makes a delicious meal even that much more rewarding.Although it stretches across 3 levels, with the main dining spaces on the first and upper levels and a private room downstairs, the 80-seat space still manages to feel like an intimate private dining experience in one's own parlour. The two-tops and four-tops are larger than normal and spaced a good deal apart, giving each diner room to both spread out and cozy up in the plush, purple velvet banquettes and admire the ornate molded ceiling panels. It's a space that feels both personal and fantastically regal all at once.",19,0.9974
790,11,6,5.0,"The Quick: It's just so much fun! Prepare to get tipsy and bond with your new 30 best friends, while you laugh, participate, and do something different.

You walk into this awesome room with walls lined with books and a giant thrones, completely transporting you into part of the skit. They immediately start you with a delicious shot, and from there the booze keeps flowing. It's a little pricey ($40/ bottle of wine) but worth it-- booze makes everything more fun. I suggest a light pregames to set the mood. The actors are talented and hysterical, honestly people you'd want to hang out with. If possible try to sit on the ground level because you participate more in the show and everyone becomes best friends. Be warned though you might be part of some ridiculous shenanigans that might not be great for a first date or for the prude at heart.It's a mix of modern pop culture, shakespeare, and all things ridiculous. It's something different to do in NYC, I highly recommend. The Damage: there is currently a deal on Yelp! For $35, I've also seen deals on groupon and I believe living social/ gilt.

791,23,13,5.0,"Proud to be a Chinese-American: Before the rise in popularity of iconic modern day NYC restaurants like Union Square Cafe, Daniel, Bouley, and Peter Luger, Chinatown NY defined East Coast Chinese cuisine. Now if we discount San Francisco in the ""Nation of California, "" the 24 hour restaurants on Mott Street began to inspire the theme for the Tribeca Film Festival documentary: ""The Search for General Tso."" Asian cuisines have evolved as fast as social media in the USA, arguably becoming more American, and long-lasting than McDonalds. Certainly, the meteoric rise of Asian cuisines I would argue has defined the ""Yelp Phenomenon."" Anyway, as I have always said it is all about the food. With all due respect to my Asian friends, who prefer the many different Asian cuisines, my culinary tastes were defined by my parents of Toisan descent. While, I love the spicy influence of Thai, Szechuan, Hunan dishes, etc. my favorites have always been the old school Cantonese dishes. Hop Kee really defines the Chinatown Cantonese experience. It may not be as well known as Shun Lee, or even the more Chinese-American Wo Hop, however on Chinese New Year it does not get any better than finding the back room in Hop Kee's basement restaurant. Now, on Chinese New Year, Hop Kee's back room is always hopping with the chants of ""Gong Hay Fat Choy."" It is not the pictures of Anthony Bourdain, and all the famous guests, the waitors who look like your Chinese Grandfather, the one button cash register, or the metal containers that create the experience. However, on Chinese New Year (The Year of the Goat/Sheep) Hop Kee has a wonderful special menu of their famous Pork Chop, Clams with Black Bean sauce, Long LIfe Noodles and many others. However, my all-time favorite dish is Hop Kee's Crab Cantonese--A large plate of perfectly cracked blue crab with sizzling Cantonese sauce made with black bean, egg, ground pork, ginger & scallion. The eggs and shell on a piping hot plate with a medium bowl of perfectly steamed white rice constitute what I want to have one day for my last meal. Having the world's best egg roll to start the meal perfectly cooked in a deep fryer is an All-Madden meal at a higher level. Like a Peter Luger porterhouse, this is something you cannot make at home. I love the crab egg, and the fact that I do not even need a mallet or crab cracker to open the perfectly prepared claws, and backfin blue crabmeat--eat your heart out my fellow Marylanders. When I die ""Take my body back to Georgetown, but give me a Crab Cantonese Chinese New Year meal at Hop Kee below Mott Street.""    I was not born in Asia, but on this Chinese New Year, I could not be more proud than to be Chinese and born in the United States. I dedicate this review to two of my grandparents: Thomas Wong my paternal grandfather, and Lee Ngon Win Chin my maternal grandmother who like many Toisanese made it possbile for more recent immigrants to come to this country. Lastly, thanks to Hop Kee for making Chinese New Year Special. I will argue with any of my Asian friends, that Hop Kee's Crab Cantonese is an Asian meal beyond compare.

Breathtaking views of Central Park, NY skyline and plenty of space to either sit and get cozy or stand by the ledge and dream. I found this spot to not be as pretentious as some of the other well known rooftop bars (such as 230 Fifth).

Eat here.*** The medium-length, summary review ***Pig & Khao is fantastic, and I couldn't even eat their signature dishes because I usually stay away from pork. I mean I had to cut the Pig out of Pig & Khao, and they still impressed. That's pretty great. To boot, I came here with a proper citizen of the Philippines, and P&K got her thumbs up, with one exception, the Chicken Inasal, which underwhelmed the both of us. I'd definitely come back, I'd recommend this to out-of-towners, to friends, for dates, for lunches, for brunches, for dinners, for winners, and I suppose for losers too--they can sit in the sad little heated patio out back and stuff mantou buns (not Filipino, but perfect in about every way) in their mouths till their sorrow is forgotten or drowned by dough.BEWARE the menu labeling. Their ""small plates"" aren't small. The khao soi could easily be most people's main plate. Even some of the sides--the chop suey, which was $%@&ing delicious, by the way--would have made for a pretty great minimalist main, in and of itself. My partner and I, deceived by the menu's willy-nilly categorization, over-ordered, and while I was delighted by this in the moment, I felt ill shortly thereafter, as my dear stomach battled for my very life against the mantou buns, which were trying to burst my insides with their doughy, assiduous expansion.*** Dish by Dish ***Side-dishes and appetizers:* Chop Suey. Allegedly a side-dish, in actuality also candidate for a very light main or appetizer. Terrific. Would have again. Not Filipino, but served there often according to my dinner partner, who said P&K's version is way better, lighter, fresher, and not drenched in sauce so the crispiness and flavor of the vegetables comes out.* Mantou buns. Side dish. Also not Filipino. Four buns a bit bigger than a doughnut hole, and like doughnuts but denser and only very lightly sweet. They were perfect. I have never had mantou before, and I don't know what their ideal is, but if their ideal is not this, then, it either ought to be, or I ought to be eating it right now, and every day, forever, and then buried with some of them, because they were so good. (Be careful with these--I think they do the thing where they expand in your stomach and threaten you with slow, pressured death, if you eat too many.)* Khao soi. Allegedly a small plate, in actuality a not-huge main. This was the best khao soi I've had outside Thailand, and also the only khao soi I've had that seemed as good as what I remember having there. To my palate, this dish was also perfectly spiced--there was enough in there to give heat, but not enough to overwhelm the flavor or to hurt. Everything above was not just excellent, but it was perfect. Which is why the main dish was so disappointing.Main dish:Chicken Inasal. It was... chicken. Just plain old chicken. I mean, they did *something* to prep it, its skin was colored and has some flavor to it, but not to any great effect. And my dinner partner mentioned it wasn't as good as what she'd sometimes get from the chicken chains of the Philippines, where it would not only be super cheap, but also come loaded with garlic rice. In this chicken's defense, I have to note it tasted better the next day as leftovers, perhaps because it didn't have to compete on my palate with all the other stuff.Dessert:Halo halo. The best iteration of this dessert I've had! The ice was a proper slush, not big tooth-chipping chips, and while it was loaded with the mix-mix of sweetness you'd expect (red yam ice cream, rice crispies, condensed milk, and cubes of flan and candied banana), it didn't feel overloaded. Drinks:I didn't try the cocktails, but I have important beer notes for you: The Lucky Buddha, a Chinese beer, is flavorless effluence poured into a lovely, jolly-Buddha-shaped bottle. Avoid. The San Miguel Pilsner, however, is a pretty good, flavorful pilsner. It seems the Philippines escaped the trap of exporting only their most generic lager beer.",25,0.9987

Unfortunately for me, god did not make me a length that agrees with most traditional Jean sizes, leaving me in the precarious position of needing to get them hemmed. Dating back to my days living in North Jersey it was relatively cheap and easy to find a place to get this done. Every town had a few laundromats or tailors.Hey, I know its New York City. There are plenty of places to get your jeans hemmed. However, the prices shocked me during my initial local search. In my neighborhood Greenwich village they wanted to charge me $17-20 dollars per pair, the horror!I decided to take matters into my own hands and went on yelp and found this little East Village gem. I called in advance and found out with their coupon on here and by checking in you can get original stitched jeans hemmed for $5 dollars. No its not a typo, these are old-school New York City prices. I arrived there on a chilly Wednesday after walking more than a mile (the lengths we go to save $25 dollars in Manhattan) and chuckled as i saw they posted a list of peoples faces via video surveillance who had shop lifted as a way to shame them, bad.... very bad people who did that! I digress, after entering the large store with rows of clothes and large lights reminiscent of a fashion runway I was greeted by Air, a very friendly receptionist who explained to me the different types of hemming available (didn't know there was more than one before!) and also suggested to me using the yelp coupon code on my phone app, which was very nice of her. I had her put pins on the bottom of the jeans as they were boot-cut, and needed to be cut just enough to not scrape the ground. She told me they would be ready in 5 days, and even suggested me a coffee spot down the street (I reviewed it too, yay!) .  After 5 days she called and told me they were ready so I strolled back before heading to a yelp event (also reviewed it, I'm on a roll here!!) and i went back in and tried the newly hemmed jeans on. They were cut to exactly where I'd have wanted, not so long that they were touching the bottom of my shoes, but not so short that you'd see my socks if I sat down. In other words, they were hemmed to hit that magical sweet spot that so few hemmed jeans ever reach. And the original stitching was still in place, successful plastic surgery of my jeans was completed. I thanked air, switched my frumpy pants for one of the newly hemmed jeans and headed out, feeling great. Suffice to say, I would recommend other Yelpers come here for any of their hemming or tailoring needs as this store is simply cut from a different cloth, :).",70,0.9855

The top of the standard (or boom boom room as it was formerly known) got thrown around in conversation and while I tried to get the ""hook-up"" from some of my promoter friends aka GET US A TABLE STAT, they were unable to do so (even though we were willing to shell out thousands of dollars). Hmm. Impressive.Finally, a friend of a friend (you know the drill) knew someone and alas, we reserved a table. The hostesses are dressed in...wait for it...wait for it...like something out of the Great Gatsby movie. You walk in to this SUPER swanky gorgeous nightclub where it isn't so packed that you can feel the sweat dripping off of the person next to you. No. No no no no. We had our own little table and it was only appropriate to order Dom. Like, literally, it would be a shame to drink something regular. This is not a regular place. Be prepared for a luxurious evening where good service actually exists in a nightclub and people around you actually smile. No one will spill a drink on you and you will not wake up in the morning smelling like you bathed in cigarettes. Wow. Definitely had a lovely evening and want to return ASAP.-I think they may be a little too strict at the door as this place has so much potential to be like THE ""it"" club but they make it very hard to get in to. When they say ""guest list"" only. They MEAN it. No BS. It's hard to reserve a table here but honestly, it's worth all the trouble if you can actually get a reso.-This review was for the club experience (after 12am)",31,0.9758
800,15,17,5.0,"My review used to say I come here every Tuesday and Thursday, but a few people (as well as my scale) brought it to my attention that I am here almost every day. I try to restrain from the sweets and walk to the back where the coffee bar is. They do not have almond milk but they do have soymilk so soy cappucino it is. The walk back is the hardest part because by that time, you are completely surround by the delicious smell of pastries and chocolate and you have to walk past all the delicious offerings and I give in 99% of the time. My favorite thing here is the chocolate rugelach. It is flakey and the perfect sweetness. I grew up in Israel, where rugelach are extremely common so naturally I have had some amazing ones, but this is one of the best ones I have tasted. You can get one... Or you can get 2 and it is a better price or something but honestly I would still buy these if they were $10 a piece. The breads here are delicious too. I bought two focaccia breads; seeded and roasted vegetable. I like the seeded much better because it has a nice crunch to it but both were really delicious. The rolls (sesame or poppy) are really soft on the inside and only $1.50. The Jerusalem baguette reminds me of the ones I used to get in Israel but with higher quality ingredients. The babka ($12) is AMAZING as well and I would highly recommend buying one, though you can only buy it as a whole which for someone like myself is extremely dangerous because I am more than able to finish a whole loaf. Honestly anything chocolate here is mind blowing. The almond croissant is also a really good choice if you are craving sweets. It kind of reminds me of a cronut in the sense that it is really crunch on the edges but super soft inside. It also has marzipan inside which is one of my favorite things in the world. It is super filling so I would recommend sharing it. The potato burekas are also good but that was my favorite thing as a kid and it feels like a sin to eat them anywhere else except Roladin (a bakery in Israel). The spinach feta are the best ones here in my opinion.I recently tried three of the hamantashens, the vanilla chocolate chip, chocolate nutella, and poppy seed. My favorite of the three is the vanilla chocolate chip. The vanilla is almost like a pudding/custard texture which I really enjoy. The poppy seed is also really good but there is A LOT of poppy filling so if that is not something you like, try the vanilla. The chocolate was a little too chocolatey for me which surprised me because I thought it would be my favorite. This place is a little pricey, they give student discounts if you are a student but everything I have tried here was amazing and it is 100% worth it.",26,0.9995
801,12,9,5.0,"Seriously, you MUST try this place! It was spectacular. Aside from having a cozy atmosphere, the food and service were phenomenal. My friend and I opted to order and split the bibimbap with spicy chicken ($18) and the le grand bulgolgi ($36). I probably liked the le grand bulgogi a bit more, but the bibimbap was tasty as well. The bulgogi is Chef's cut prime beef rib-eye marinated in Korean barbecue sauce, grilled on open fire served with kimchi and brussels sprouts. The barbecue sauce has a nice mesquite flavor. The steak should be eaten completely together with the kimchi and brussels sprouts for an absolute perfect bite. The bulgogi, which we ordered medium rare, was tender, melt in your mouth perfection. The bibimbap with spicy chicken was served with a bowl of rice with bean sprouts, zucchini, shiitake mushroom, julienned carrots, seaweed chips, gochujang (a red chili sauce) and a fried egg. You mix everything together yourself for a really nice portion of bibimbap. It was a nice blend of flavors. For dessert, we opted for the green tea pudding ($8). If you like the flavor of green tea ice cream, you'll definitely enjoy this. It's served in a shooter and topped with house made whipped cream and a cookie crumble. The pudding is not too heavy or sweet, so I left feeling like I could still fit in my clothes. Just a note: Although our dishes came out at the same time, at the tables to the left and right of us, their food was served at different times. It would be nice if the restaurant could address this issue. Either way, don't let that deter you from coming here.",10,0.9944
802,18,6,5.0,"Went on a Friday night around 8:30ish. I had read an article about this restaurant and been meaning to try it out. The dining area seats over 300 hundred and the wait time for a table was only about 5-10 minutes When you first come in you will notice the huge tank which hold exceptionally large lobsters. I AM TALKING 7-10 POUND LOBSTERS. Insane. You also notice the huge beautiful bar. They literally had at least 7 bartenders. I knew I could truly appreciate this establishment because it is properly staff. As soon as we were seated we were introduced to our server. I ordered a glass of wine to go along with my dinner as well.There menu has three things -whole lobster (steamed or grilled)-lobster roll -burger Each comes with fries and a salad. This is not a place you bring your vegan friend to. LolOur food came out in less than 20 minutes and was delivered on a silver platter. I ordered the grilled whole lobster with lemon butter. My husband order steamed. I think the grilled lobster is better and less messy in terms of the tomalley of the lobster. I am not a fan of the tomalley and that is why I order it grilled. The lobster tasted great, the salad was pretty basic, & the fries are pretty addicting.I WILL DEFINITELY BE REVISITING THIS ESTABLISHMENT SOON. Its is a great deal for the amount and quality of food you receive.",20,0.9853

Broadway location for which I've grown fond of since their opening.They have free WiFi and a few seats to enjoy a cup of coffee with a friend, though much like the E. Broadway location...

804,12,10,5.0,"Veselka is forever a horoshayie*memory in my mind.First time I've stepped into the NY streets, I stayed at a couple's apartment arranged through AirBnB. Completely new to the city and hungry after a 6 hour flight, I asked them for a suggestion for late lunch.""Go to Veselka, it's just down a few blocks. We go there with friends often. Great Ukrainian diner..""With this advice from mere strangers, I waltzed down the street picturing myself as a petite Carrie. (The things watching too much SaTC before flying out will do to ya..) The corner diner was packed, but as I had arrived alone, I decided to sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen. I ordered blintzes with the works, my hunger mixed with happiness of being in the city didn't register that it would be too much food. It was delicious. I think I drank a cup of coffee as well. Which is a must for any diner visit for me. The service was quick, the food delicious!When my mom (who was born in Ukraine) visited, we went here on a whim. Again, we sat at the bar, this time we ordered pierogi and borsht and a few other things. As someone who has Russian blood, but has never made borsht from scratch, I sure am picky. I actually judge Ukrainian/Russian restaurants by their quality of this hot staple. The red beet soup flavored with beef with a dollop of sour cream on top. Oh yeah..It was a bowl of deliciousness that I couldn't get enough of. In fact I swore I'd visit again (and again and again...) in the winter months to be warmed by the goodness!

I been a couple of times and have had fabulous service every time. Whether I'm sitting at the bar or with a large party at a table the service has been way above par. All of the cocktails I've had are fresh and delicious, their happy hour is great, and can you really go wrong with a solid (cheap) burger and wings? Nope! Great new addition to the neighborhood.",13,0.936
806,9,8,5.0,"DA-LISH.So I have been in a bit of a foodie funk lately. Everything seems mediocre. Everything. It's pretty upsetting. Enter Maysville on a Friday night. I was meeting my friend Lea for drinks and we chose Maysville for the location and the intense bourbon selection we had read about. I met her right at 6:30 on the dot and my word was it crowded. There was absolutely nowhere to sit at the bar. Nowhere to stand, either. So we decided to order an appetizer or two and snag a table. We were seated at a super tight little table in the actual bar area, which I didn't love. After our first drink arrived though, it was all good, baby. I had the Noreaster (whiskey, ginger beer, maple syrup, lime). My stomach had been a bit upset that day, so I thought the ginger beer would really help a sister out. Booze logic! Hot damn. This was one bangin-ass drink. For realsies. Come here just for this alone. Delicious. We looked over the menu a few times and had a hard time choosing what to have. My friend doesn't eat pork (why she agreed to go there I will never understand) and most of the dishes are based around glorious, delectable pork. Anyway, I'm not one for wallowing and we were already there so....Shrimp Toasts (celery and ginger aioli) were excellent. I was especially glad these came before any other dishes. They were robust but also....delicate? I just don't think they would have been as good after some of the heavier dishes. Grilled Flatbread (brussel sprouts, buttermilk, sheep's milk cheese and crispy pig ear) so good. I mean it was likely one of the healthiest dishes (hahah JOKE) on the menu, and it was really good. The brussel sprouts were all shaved and drizzled in cheese, the flatbread was a nice balance between soft and crispy and we had the crispy pig ear on the side, to accommodate my friend. But there was no way I was going to give that ish up. It looked like teeny tiny slices of chicken cutlet. It was salty and delicious. I especially liked the flavor of the ear with the brussel sprouts. Don't let the fact that it's pig ear scare you. It doesn't look like an ear, and if that's what ear tastes like, bring me more. We also went with the Mushroom Tart (whipped ricotta cheese and pickled apple) which was honestly just okay. But you don't come to Maysville for their mushrooms, now do you? I think not. Best part of the whole meal? The cornbread they serve in lieu of a bread basket. For the two of us, we recieved four slices of steaming hot cornbread with soft butter, which obviously melted all over the bread before the entire thing melted in my mouth. We even had seconds. Yes, seconds on the bread basket. Bring me thirds. As for the space itself, it was really gorgeous. It walked a fine line between being too girly or too masculine, with somehow striking the perfect balance between the two. Massive photographs of horses on the walls, a carrera marble bar and warm lighting throughout, including a wall of whiskey and bourbon, all softly back-lit to catch your attention, but not take away from your dinner companion. Even the wallpaper has a golden glow, which balances nicely with the wood and steel barstools. You know I am a sucker for a nice space. Anyway, have you been? No? Well, that's a tremendous mistake. Get thee to Maysville. Have the pork and bourbon.",12,0.9968
807,13,9,5.0,"Crush is up there with Flatiron Wine and Astor Wines as one of the best wine shops in the entire city. This is the place you go when you need to find a bottle for a BYOB birthday at Peking Duck House (a sick vintage of Spätlese from a strong producer, duh). This is the place you go to when you want minimalist, gorgeous glassware (Zalto) so you can pretend to be an adult when you have friends over and open a bottle (as an aside, damn you Aldo Sohm for tripling the popularity of these. Now we have to wait for Ryan Sutton to make some eager comment about them so they stop being cool with the tools again.). But this is also the place you go when you want some Savennières or Chablis but don't want to break the bank. For in spite of the fact that at the high end (grand cru Burgundy, cult Champagnes) Crush crushes it, they also thoughtfully curate at the $20 - $25 level. From Beaujolais to the eccentric Jura, Crush is also a wine shop where you can feel comfortable asking the staff for help or recommendations without feeling like 1) they don't actually know very much themselves or 2) that they know too much to translate for some plebian - aka you. I've come and simply asked for a Vouvray, no other context given, and was guided to a wonderful wine through thoughtful, genuine questions. I've also had a ten minute discussion about whether a particular Crémant d'Alsace would be more citrus or orchard fruit forward (Pinot Blanc blends are straight tricky) and it didn't feel forced, or pretentious, or even as absurd as it probably was from any objective perspective.So, expand your horizons here. Better yet, it's the holidays: expand the horizons of others. Have a friend who, mystifyingly, still finds it funny to scream ""I am NOT drinking any fucking Merlot!"" yet you feel obligated to remain friends with? Get them some Château Pétrus and let them put that in their pipe and smoke it.Bonus points: Their website is fantastic. The search options are sufficiently nerdy, and the landing page is surprisingly helpful, highlighting recent acquisitions, special sales, and generally interesting news in the world of wine. You don't have to be a cork-dork to like Crush, but don't be too surprised if you start to become one.",19,0.9942

810,22,21,5.0,"I don't eat Chinese food too often as my taste buds don't have a liking for this cuisine. But, wait, before you call me an Asian hater, I can explain. I am not one of those Chinese Americans that's too snobby for my own people's food, that's hardly the case. It's more like I am a health nut, and well, Chinese food is basically heart attack on a platter. But after an extremely grueling Bikram class right upstairs, me and my homegirls needed desperately to restart our engines. Bikram yoga will kill you, but you will appreciate it later. So all the glowing reviews for this place is for the Cracklin chicken and well if you eat birds of the fowl family, you have got to get this dish. It comes with about 5 to 6 pieces of LARGE chicken pieces fried to perfection. The pieces are seriously as big as a small bird. On top of that, it comes with fried rice, soup of your choice and salad. And all this food is for $16. Since I don't eat meat, I got the Tofu Szechuan style, served with a side of fried rice, an order of plantains and soup of your choice. And all this for $16. My other friend got the General Tso Shrimp, with side of yellow rice. This was $17. I'll have to tell you, when the waiters brought out a dish of egg noodle chips with a side of duck sauce, I just couldn't stop smiling. It just brought back so many good memories of when I was a child and going out to eat with my family. Those were some of my happiest moments. We ladies enjoyed our meals, chatted about life, catching up and enjoying our adventure into a time warp. The restaurant looks like it's right out of the 80s, with a diner top in the front of the restaurant with the coolest stools (that's right, Hipster is in), and they have a few tables with booth seating, and of course, very tacky wall art. That is a quintessential Chinese restaurant ambiance, which I took in with fondness. The waiters were very nice, smiling all the time, and speaking three different languages while working quickly to serve everyone. We came in at 10pm and despite them closing at 11pm, they allowed us to enjoy a most relaxing meal and the waiters never rushed us and let us take our time. I will definitely come back again for other Tofu dishes served with plantains. This is my go-to now after a crazy-ass Bikram class. Never mind that I also thought the waiters were exceptionally cute and adorable, wink wink.",25,0.9968

About 10 mins away from yonkers which is the first city technically being ""upstate"". -The community itself is very diverse with lots of people from all walks of life and backrounds. from old Irish tradition to hip hip/jazzy vibes you have a little bit of everything here in this location-Kingsbridge arms is a co-op apartment complex with a full blown community room (100 dollars to reserve for the day up to 2am), full laundry mat with numerous of washers and dryers (closes 9pm daily)-Has 9 floors and each floors has its own garbage room so if your too lazy you can always throw your trash in that room.-this place also has a intercom system with security guards so you need to know what apart your going to and they each all know who lives in each apartment they each have their way of making themselves known to the tenants here! -again..... I LIVE here lol -walls are very thick do you cant here people business unless they are yelling or physically doing something loud! So you will feel comfortable sleeping at night.- did I forget to mention that I have a BALCONY!! -I live in a 3 bedroom apartment so it's a lot of room for a descent price!

I ordered the dancing spicy ramen and my boyfriend ordered the california ramen. I actually thought the california ramen wasn't so great, but he really liked it. It's got this weird tomato broth that's kind of refreshing, if you're into that kind of thing.I wanted thick, creamy, garlicy ramen, which is exactly what I got. The calamari was delicious and fit in surprisingly well, even though I thought it was an odd choice when I ordered it. The broth was filling, perfectly salty, super savory...I definitely want to come back and try a few other things on the menu.

I heard from a friend that they had an amazing 6-course tasting menu for an affordable price ($75) and they were able to snag a Michelin Star within the first year of opening. All these accolades are EXACTLY on point!To start, the service here is impeccable! When we arrived at our reservation, our hostess was very apologetic about making us wait and she offered to buy us drinks. We opted for the Smoky Kiss and The Queen's Punch. Among the two, the Queen's Punch was the better drink, with a little less of an alcoholic aftertaste.When we were finally seated, we chose the 6-course tasting menu. While we were waiting, our server gave us a choice of a couple different breads: sourdough, bacon and cheddar brioche, and rye. Like any starving individual, I stopped listening when our server said bacon and ordered the brioche immediately. AMAZINGGGGG. We asked for seconds and thirds throughout the night and our server happily obliged. The sourdough was pretty good as well, but no contest for the brioche.Our dishes were paced perfectly and in this order:- Broccoli soup | oxtail | parsley: The oxtail croquette was SO DELICIOUS. Be sure to savor this one! The broccoli soup was a great appetizer for a cold night. It was thick and had great texture without being too heavy.- Cold smoked scallops | cucumbers | black garlic | pears | sea beans: This dish had the best presentation. It was served with smoke bubbling underneath a glass cover and when the server lifted the glass, the smoke dissipated into the air, drawing the attention of other patrons sitting near us. The rolls of pickled cucumber here were my favorite. Everything on this dish complemented each other perfectly. - Quail | blackberries | bread sauce | roasted onions: I haven't had quail too many times before this, but I really enjoyed this one. The bread sauce was very unique and tasted great with the tender quail, which fell right off the bone. I only wish there was more meat!- New Zealand red deer | flavors of gin: This was my favorite dish of the night. The red deer was cooked perfectly and did not have a gamey taste to it at all. The portions looked small at first, but as I was eating this one, it didn't feel that way at all. I think it was just the right portion to satiate an appetite without being overwhelming.- Grape | ginger: This was a really interesting palate cleanser. I liked how at certain parts it tasted somewhat like a peanut butter jelly sandwich. It was bright and sweet without being too overly saccharine.- Chocolate mousse cake | pear | almond: I wasn't a huge fan of this dessert, but it was still pretty good. I'm big on textures so I really appreciated the medley of flavors and combination of textures on this plate.This is probably one of my best dining experiences in NYC and I will definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone!

But what I do want to share is that, despite the receipts you see on here, Yasuda has one of the best deals around for high quality sushi.Especially after spending 2 weeks eating my way through Japan this summer, I realized how lucky I was to be able to find similar quality sushi at my doorstep.While you can opt to get the omakase (which don't get me wrong is fantastic), if you don't want to spend $150+ you can also do the following (assuming splitting between 2 people):- 2 orders of Sushi Matsu: 12 pieces of sushi and half a roll each for $44 per person- Sashimi Take: 5 varieties of sashimi (you can order 1 extra piece so that you get 3 pieces each) for $27.50- order a few special pieces that aren't on the ""set"" menu. I always like to get an addition piece (or two...) of uniAnd that brings you to just under $75 per person!Tip: do try and get a counter seat if you can regardless of if you're doing omakase or a la carte.

Next was the Papaya Salad (Tum Poo-Plara) it is Isan salad with fermented fish sauce and field crabs. Unfortunately, the taste was too pungent for our Americanized palate. The waiter incidentally over heard us and was kind enough to offer to replace with another salad called Tum Thai Kai Kem (spicy salad with salted egg). +1 star for that!The fried Isan sausages (Sai Krok Isan) were simply epicurean. the grilled coconut marinated beef skewer (Moo Ping Kati Sod) with sticky rice on the side made our dinner sumptuous.With top notch customer service and its inexpensiveness the competitors near by should really be worried.",22,0.9636

It was good, and I only had to wait in line for about an hour. But it really doesn't live up to the insane hype. Their current seasonal menu offers a Gingerbread Croissant ($4.00), which is far superior. It's perfectly flaky, and comes cut in half, having been stuffed with toasted pecans, a caramel coulant, and topped with marshmallows and powdered sugar. It's seriously good, and requires no wait!I've also had a few of their savory menu items as well. The Perfect Little Egg Sandwich ($5.00) is just that. Perfect, fluffy, and delicious. It's served on a warm fresh brioche bun, and comes with gruyere cheese. It's an awesome snack, and a great pairing if you're looking for something to offset the sugar coma. For a more heavier savory option, their Mustard Braised Cabbage & Burrata Panini is also a decent vegetarian choice. Although the egg sandwich is better. The secret is their soup though. The Parsnip and Cauliflower Soup ($5.50) is delicious, and it's served with homemade Cheese Gougère, one of the best breads my tastebuds have ever encountered. Just get the soup, you won't regret it. Unfortunately, this place is super touristy, and can get really crowded but they have ample amount of seating with a back patio garden.

820,16,10,5.0,"City Bakery brings its popular offshoot, Birdbath, to Midtown East. Here you have a bakery that is dedicated to fresh, organic ingredients for its salads, sandwiches, and soups. With that comes a relatively steeper price point for most breakfast and lunch seekers who are not picky. It will annoy some who notice that prices are not listed anywhere. An average meal can set you back $10+. For others who appreciate the concept of an eco-friendly eatery, Birdbath has everything going for it. The salads and soups taste very fresh and flavorful leaving you not feeling overdosed in oil or sodium by the end of consumption. If you are allowed one bad eat for comfort, then their mac-n-cheese will surely hit that spot. The vegan chocolate chip cookies are excellent without being ""oversugared"", and the amazing City Bakery hot chocolate (with giant marshmallows) can be found here as well. The enormous Baker's Muffin alone, with its crusted top sprinkled with powdered sugar and soft interior loaded with raisins and walnuts, makes it worth giving Birdbath a visit!",20,0.971

Walking through the door, you'll be a bit surprised just how peaceful and pleasant the space is. The front desk staff is incredibly warm, friendly, and accommodating, and the masseuses are nothing short of talented, skilled, and remarkably effective. (Hailey is my girl.)

Gentle frou-frou, it's not; therapeutic ecstasy, it is.Now, for the clincher: It's 39 freakin' dollars TOTAL for 75 minutes of massage (which I usually divide between back and feet).I selfishly, shamelessly beg you: please book your appointments from 9 am-5 pm, M-F.

Finally, one Friday night my friends and I came in after a Tango class we took near by. We were in good moods already and wanted to keep the evening going, it was after all, a beautiful Friday evening in Manhattan.We walked in and immediately noticed the really cool decor and ambiance. It's homey, chic and a little rustic. The food is really good here, but you will have to order a lot if you want to be stuffed, which is great because you get to try a lot of different things! Jon had the paella, I had the arepas and I must say that the guac is definitely on point and is a great snack to have with evening drinks. Even though anything you pick will be a delicious choice, I would definitely suggest coming here especially for the drinks. They are simply amazing and will blow your mind. I had the Spicy Coconut Mojito and I really wish I had ordered more than one (I switched to another drink which was also a really great choice, but I am still thinking about how crazy amazing the mojito was). Another nice surprise were the napkins. Where else can you grab a drink and learn different pick up lines in Spanish?What you'll find here is very good service, a super nice & chill vibe, and drinks that will make this place your usual drinking spot. It's a perfect spot for an intimate date, or to come and chill with friends. Since coming only once, I've already raved to all my drinking buddies (I mean come on, who in Manhattan doesn't drink a lot) that we will be coming here to enjoy some specialty cocktails. I am very happy that I finally came by and absolutely will be back again soon! Cheers!",11,0.9986

825,15,7,5.0,"On 11/4/14 my friend convinced me to sign up for the $39 for 30 day deal & attend my very first yoga class EVER; bikram yoga. A short background on myself: I HATE heat, have asthma & heart conditions/issues, & I dislike sweating. So with that you could fairly assume that I would've walked into the studio & turned right around to walk out, but I didn't. I kept going after my very 1st day & I finished their 30 DAY CHALLENGE, which is THIRTY classes in THIRTY days. #dedication ;p (whoo-hoo)Studio Lobby:You can either take the stairs or take the elevator to the 3rd floor. When you get upstairs you remove your shoes & place them in one of the cubbies provided. You then check in at the counter & there you can rent/buy items; e.g. coconut water, smart water, yoga clothing, mats, towels, etc.Locker Room:The women's locker room is kept pretty clean. There are a lot of lockers & definitely enough for the # of students that would be attending the class. Don't forget to bring your own lock, even a small luggage one would do. The locker room is very narrow so can/will get crowded when classes are coming/going. They provide some toiletries for everyone; e.g. soap, shampoo/conditioner, q-tips, etc. They even supply blow dryers, brushes, etc. There are 4 showers & they are limited to 3mins.Studio:The studio is on the 4th floor; you can take the elevator or the stairs. Be careful when taking the stairs as there can be a good amount of sweat, so use those handrails. There is also a little outside area where students can hang out before/after a class (but usually after). Everyone falls in line outside the studio to wait to be let in. An employee usually comes to ""turn"" the room in between classes ~15mins before the next class is to begin & that is when the next class can start entering to claim their spot. The studio gets super-crazy-ridiculously hot, but that's the point. The room is carpet, as bikram yoga is supposed to be so not sure why some of the other reviewers were complaining about it, but I do see the concern w/the sweat. This is very true & you can definitely see/feel the sweat in the carpet, but it really isn't that bad IMO -- or maybe it's just me. I will say that they do need to vacuum a bit more as there can be a good amount of debris on the carpet. The classes fit 39 people & you can sign up through their app/website or at the studio.Bikram Yoga:The class itself is rough & definitely something you need to keep working on. Though you do the same postures in each class, you realize you can always get better & go into each posture more -- in my case I'm still trying to learn how to do all of them correctly or just get into them in general. I've met people who have said they've been doing yoga for over 40 years & they still need to take breaks in class. I applaud them & hope to keep it up myself. Also the instructors always remind you to only look at yourself, so there is no competition here, you are only there to better yourself.Instructors:Here are the list of instructors I've taken in the last 32 consecutive days, the # of times I had them, & the order I had them = Patrick O'Keefe (1x)Omri Kleinbeger (5x)Melissa Ritz (8x)Eddie Marco (3x)Justine Gartner (3x)Patrick Lynch (1x)Yvette Velasquez (2x)Maayan Yefet (2x)Luke Strandquist (1x)Natalia Maldonado (1x)Charly Seamon (2x)Lesly Klose (1x)Summer Saunders (1X)Emily Faurholt (1x)They all have their own ways of teaching, but the foundation is all the same. Some instructors like the class more humid, some w/more heat, & some w/a good balance of both. Also some instructors teach more ""military"" style & others are a bit more laid back. But something that goes across the board w/ALL of them is that they are all INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE. Like seriously, so supportive of you, your needs, your practice, & everything in between. They are such positive beings & as I continue to practice I am trying to get it to rub off on me. As you continue to go you'll begin to have your favorite instructors, I know I have mine. I just don't feel it is fair to post mine as everyone is different & you should come & try a few classes out for yourself to see what fits.After finishing the challenge not only has my physical health improved but so has my mental health. I am much more patient, kind, & encouraging to the people around me. Also I've learned how to ""brush off"" a lot of the things that would normally get to me. There were/are some days where my cardiac/asthma issues are getting the best of me, but I still attend class. When people doubt my decision I explain to them how I would not go if the instructors weren't as encouraging/supportive as they are, or if it were a competition with the other students. I go at my own pace, and the instructors respect/support/encourage that. When in the room I feel detached from my life & any other stresses; I am there to just focus on myself for 90mins -- & that alone feels refreshing.",22,0.9985

After one bite, I understood why this is the un changing dish at per se. Waiting service is impeccable. The waiter was very attentive and actually offered to shave off a very generous portion of extra truffle on our pasta dish. It was beautiful to see piles and piles of shaved truffles a mounting on top of my pasta. :) The whole experience took us about 3 hrs and while we were eating, we watched the sun goes down the columbus circle.

Only in New York City... Voila, Amelie! Also the name of my favorite movie. I had walked past this restaurant many times in my old days of living in Manhattan. So we stopped in, and it was PACKED. The staff all spoke lovely French, and added to the authentic flair of this modern French restaurant. They worked hard to seat people as quickly and efficiently as possible in such a tiny space. The wine selection was amazing, and they had excellent happy hour specials. The lighting was dim and the atmosphere intimate. We tried the escargot, and it was shockingly nice. Also, sopping up the delicious garlic parsley sauce with the fresh bread was half of the fun. I had the smoked salmon/avocado salad (I couldn't have anything heavy that day for some reason), and he had the duck confit. Both were excellent, and the wine pairings were on POINT. In my crazed hastiness to get some bread from the bread basket (ok fine, I had also had a bit of wine), I accidentally knocked over my wine glass and it shattered. The waiters were so sweet about the accident- ""Was there wine in it?"" ""No, I drank it all."" ""Oh good, that's the important part."" I offered to clean up the mess, since I am a server at another restaurant. Of course they did not allow me to, but at the end of our meal, the waiter ran over and gave me a dollar tip.

828,13,17,5.0,"One imaginary teardrop rolls slowly down my right cheek! (sniffs) It is a joy experienced while simultaneously reflecting on the triumph over hardship.

I've gone to that site countless times with wishes not to see the neon red ""Coming Soon"" sign. It never happened. Then what?

I have no idea how many times I've made that trip with the sole purpose of grabbing a cachapa. It's a good thing I have an annual CitiBike membership. The temperature was hot, tepid, cool, cold, frigid, brisk, warm, and sweltering again. I remember doing google searches for any article that might shed some light on the magical opening date that changed over and over again. I remember peering in and seeing the long wooden bench on the side of one wall, and stainless steal metal seats on the other to match the stainless steel tabletops. I remember seeing the sign, being excited and posting a storefront picture on Yelp. I remember being equally thrilled when I saw the sign saying, ""we are hiring."" ...all just toying with my emotions. (sniffs again) This is bitter sweet!

Both, the Shredded Beef Patacon and La Gourda Cachapa, were certified by my Colombian friend who has eaten both on many occasions while visiting Colombia (Colombian names differ). I think that lends more cred to the food at Patacon Pisao than I can, considering I was just recently introduced to Colombian and Venezuelan food.Cachapas: sweet corn bread like cake sandwichesPatacons: hardened and flattened green plantain sandwichesArepas: white corn meal patties...lots of flavor regardless!The tequenos are extremely popular at the Inwood location and should be tried with the lightly spiced pink sauce. They also have several ethnic flavored drinks to go along with the experience.The neighborhood spot has great tasting food not found anywhere else in the area and should be a hit.

835,14,7,5.0,"**Dinner tasting menu review, FALL 2014*I had a friend come into town and of course, he wanted to try a Daniel Boulud restaurant. With only a couple days ahead of time, we were able to secure a spot for two at Cafe Boulud, thankfully, at 9:30pm. At 9:30pm, this place is still very bustling! Our table had a 45+ min delay which was one of the few downsides, so we hung out at Bar Pleiades next door.We were seated side by side by the wall, allowing us to people watch while we ate our dinner. We were probably the youngest people there. Decor of the restaurant is lovely, but I will say that towards the end of the night, the very powerful heater kicked on and I was literally sweating just sitting still because it was so hot and uncomfortable. Not enjoyable at all, but by that point at least we were ready to leave.We did the $125/pp tasting menu with a few drinks in between as recommended by the waiter. Best decision ever. I LOVED the fact that instead of bringing us both the same dishes every course, we each got a different one. Essentially, a 7 course tasting menu turned into 10+ and I was beyond ecstatic. I'm not sure if this is always the case, so I would check with the waiter first.I'm not going to go into detail about each dish, but they were all tasteful and well worth the price, especially since you basically get to taste the menu if you go as two. Notables:- Olive bread - you get to choose out of multple kinds on tray, but the olive bread is for sure the tastiest.- Amuse bouche - everything was delicious - chef's choice of 3- NZ Venison - never had anything like this before and the oats/seasoning on this is just absolutely amazing- Chestnut veloute - oh my god.- Dessert - all of it.Service was of course amazing and the waiter made sure to explain each and every dish we got and even stuck around to chit chat when we had questions about the food or wine. Staff is quite knowledgable on the dishes and drinks.If I return to Cafe Boulud and do a la carte, my go-tos would be the foie gras, chestnut veloute, vension, and Marrakesh delight (seasonal dessert, but the thyme creme brulee was good as well).",17,0.9942

First, remember to add the garnish. Second, wipe off the excess drops of sauce that eagerly dripped from your ladle and splashed onto the barren white plate that is your canvas. Time is quickly running out and before you know it, you're down to the last few seconds of the clock. Boom. Time is up.Clearly, if you can crank out amazing dishes under intense pressure, you can only begin to imagine the quality plates Top Chef Season 1 winner Harold Dieterle can assemble under ample time. Shortly after his win, he opened Perilla located in the West Side. Despite its rampant growth in popularity, Perilla has remained modest. The decor strays from opulence and is instead enhanced with tasteful simplicity. The lighting is resplendent and brilliantly golden. Altogether, Perilla presents a very charismatic and handsome atmosphere. Perilla has a menu full of fine, fresh American fare. The ingredients are heavily dependent on what is locally available and thus, the menu seasonally changes. The menu clearly reflects Dieterle's love affair with Asian ingredients. The menu is embellished with vibrant asian notes: basil, kimchi, black sesame, and bok choy. A separate menu was created for New York Restaurant Week 2014. Steamed Mussels are the perfect appetite primer. They are steamed and tossed in rings of sautéed yellow onions. The mussels are topped with a coarse mixture of garlic bread crumbs for a satisfying texture and bathed in a creamy stock. Minuscule pieces of tasso ham are also sprinkled onto the dish for a smoky flavor. This was swiftly followed by the Roasted All Natural Chicken (26). This features a thick slab of chicken breast served over a bed of pearl barley. The skin was perfectly salted and crispy, the breast was oozing with au jus. This entree playfully incorporates the flavors of roasted peaches, coriander, cumin and fresh chilies. All desserts are designed by Laura Jackson. The Panna Cotta unites an eclectic combination of flavors: lime, jalapeños, and gooey melted caramel. It is adorned with cereal-like puffs of amaranth for a delightful crunch. My favorite element of the dessert was the sweet sorbet that was transformed from watermelon juice. Perilla's wine list is extensive! I ordered a glass of sherry, Valdespino Contrabandista Amontillado ($10). It has a deep nutty flavor with strong accents of plum. I definitely recommend this for people who enjoy fruity, concentrated, and medium dry wine.Some Pro Tips: Cards are accepted. Restrooms are a little small but well-kept. Perilla features booths that are appropriate for larger parties. There is a bar large enough to seat 10 comfortably in the first half of the restaurant. The staff was extremely welcoming and the service was spotless throughout the night.",31,0.9944
838,15,9,5.0,"The other night was my birthday so I reserved a table of 15 (which just also is the biggest table they have) for a big and fun Chinese AYCE (all you can eat) hot pot. A handful of my coworkers and some friends from around the neighborhood swung by for the 7:30 reservation (yes they take reservations). With that said - they do take reservations - and if you book early enough you can book out all 4 semi private rooms that can each hold about 10-15 comfortably. So think of a party of like 60 can be seated and hanging out all having a good time.Also - it's BYOB. They don't have a liquor license yet so they aren't serving alcohol - but if you feel like you want to drink - you can bring your own. Not sure if there are any liquor stores near by but if you want to bring beers, wines, liquors etc. you definitely can.The hot pot is great - all you can eat except for some premium stuff on the bottom - but really - you don't need all that. Just pick and choose what you want and you'll get everything in a timely fashion. There is usually a 2 hour time limit - but if you have a big group and if they aren't busy they won't bother you. Just make sure you know what you're getting in terms of soup bases. Just know that the spicy style is sechuan spicy with the pepper corns that have that numbing spicyness. They do have a kim chi version as well.",23,0.9692
839,10,10,5.0,"Not much to be said here that hasn't been said. Just a few pointers:1) Try to avoid the 9:30pm seating (it's the last bar seating) and at this point, Nakazawa-San will no longer ask if you want additional pieces after your omakase. We wanted an extra uni and toro piece but could not get 'em :(2) He also didn't ask us to pick an urchin to open up for our uni piece...I suspect this only occurs during the first seating, but am not positive.3) There is no waiting room in the restaurant, so be prepared to huddle in a corner until it's your turn.4) If you can't get a bar seat, I'd continue trying and pass on the dining room as it's very far away from the action AND Nakazawa-San only prepares the sushi for the bar diners. 5) However, if you must, try to get table #20, which is right next to the bar. Usually reserved for VIPs.Service was great - they paid extra attention to me since I was the girl on crutches #crutchlife. ALSO, Nakazawa-San is as endearing as all the other reviewers made him out to be! He dipped quickly after our omakase, not but before making himself a hand roll to snack on (approx MSRP - $18).",21,0.8105

Not only is it the best food I've had in months...I've never had Persian food before, and I had no idea what I was missing. They only had 3 options the day that I visited, so I sampled (you must get samples!) of all three. I ended up going with the one that is the crowd pleaser. Did I mention it's like the cheapest meal you can get in NYC? Oh, and healthy!

I have never seen a show/musical where the show was bigger than the venue. The show is so good it makes the entire place seem bigger than it really is. It's hard to explain this feeling unless you see it. It was amazing. It feels like the theatre was too small to contain the energetic, flashy, and 'big' musical. But at the same time I am so happy that it's at a small theatre because the show was so up close that it made it even more amazing. I couldn't believe it is an Off-Broadway show! There were really no bad seats in the Arclight Theatre because the theatre is tiny. We sat in the second row so it felt like everything was happening right in front of us. AWESOME! I knew nothing of this play when we decided to go see it because of the 20 at 20 promotion. So glad I convinced my bf to go see the play with me. He would have never believed how good the musical is if he didn't go and see it for himself. The evil Lord Cimex completely reminded me of Dr. Frank-N-Furter from The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I loved every character. The actress who played the mad scientist Carly is an amazing singer and actress. And I totally loved Dionne Salon played by Brian Charles Rooney. I laughed through the entire show. It was the most entertaining and fun time I've had at a musical. Because of the writeup from NY Times, Critic's Pick, the show has been super popular. Bedbugs!!! continues through Oct. 26, 2014 at the ArcLight Theatre. I suggest you run to see this show before it is gone. You gotta see it!!!",16,0.9975

At 10pm, the place still had a few tables and the vibe was really chill, cozy and welcoming. Good deep house playing also helps. I arrive early and didn't want to wait outside as it was blustering cold. I walked in and was greeted by a very handsome staff. He was friendly and sat me right up close to the bar. I order a Cuvee bubbly to get the warmth going. I sit at the bar for about 20 minutes waiting for the lust of my life. And while I waited, I got to chat up the staff. Everyone that works here is European, no Americans. The handsome Italian with insanely sick dimples was very kind to also charge my phone. Now that is good service. And extremely mesmerizing eye candy. My date arrives and we are moved to a table that faces the front of the restaurant. We order up a few draft beers and decided on the mezze platter ($35) which includes hummus, stuffed grape leaves, spicy feta dip, roasted eggplant and artichoke dip. This was a nice serving size for 2 and it came with plenty of pita bread. We also ordered the shrimp mezze ($15). Everything was excellent albeit a bit pricy. But remember, you are in Nolita. You're paying their rent also and feeding those models. I was told that on the weekends, it gets pretty lively and they kick up the deep house music a bit.

845,15,13,5.0,"My new Warby Parker glasses and I are still casually dating, but I think we're going to get a little more serious because I'm starting to really like them. I've been wearing contacts daily for more than ten years and only ordinary (i.e. sad-looking) glasses for those times right before bed and such. When those ordinary glasses broke recently, I knew that it was time to get a pair I could actually wear during the day without embarrassing myself.This location is on the smaller side, but there are also fewer customers. Frames (both prescription and sunglasses) are placed on back-lit shelves, and customers are free to try on as many pairs as they'd like. I love:1. the staff. When I was first browsing, they completely left me alone, but when I grew a bit overwhelmed with the selection (I guess my body language made it obvious?) one staff member swiftly came over and eased my anxiety and suggested frames that went well with my face. Even though I took forever in making a decision and asked at least three different staff members to pick from my top two, everyone made the experience seamless and enjoyable. 2. how easy it was to purchase frames. All prescription frames are $95 total with an option to get high-index lenses for higher prescriptions at only $30 more. They accept eyeglass prescriptions that are up to a year old, but they can also call your eye doctor or schedule you for an eye exam there for $75.3. their home try-on system. I went to the store because I live relatively close by and because I wanted to try on as many frames in as many colors as possible, but most people opt to do the home try-on. It gives people an opportunity to get up to 5 frames to try on for 5 days with free shipping both ways. The only sad thing is that some frames aren't part of the home try-on for some reason.4. the Warby Parker blog. It seems the Warby Parker team is very interested in all things literary; the most obvious clue comes from the library setup of all of their Manhattan stores, and the less obvious clue comes from their blog. They update their blog with infographics of things to read and see, and they're oftentimes very funny. I also learned that the store's name is derived from two Kerouac characters: Warby Pepper and Zagg Parker (Zagg Pepper would also have been a cool store name). 5. their buy a pair, give a pair philosophy. They make a monthly donation based on the number of glasses sold, and those funds go to training, glasses, and eye exams in developing countries. 6. their monocle (warbyparker.com/monocle).Likelihood of another visit:When these glasses break.",20,0.9927
846,13,11,5.0,"tl;drThis place tops everything I have reviewed. 5.5 stars.tl;dr 2If you don't read anything in my review, go to Benton on a Friday (EARLY! like before 12:30 PM) and get their Friday special chirashi. Then come back and read this review. You will know why I freaking rave about this place.----If I could give 5.5 stars, Benton gets it. No, Chez Panisse and Ippudo are nowhere close to getting 5.5 stars.What makes Benton so magical is that they make the most incredible benton boxes that I have ever tasted -- no, EXPERIENCED -- in the United States. I spent some time studying abroad in Tokyo when I was in college, and I used to drop by this bento shop after my language school classes were over at around 4:30 PM. They were still selling the leftover bento boxes from lunch at a discount, and if I'm lucky I could score a bento for just 750 yen or so and have it as a yummy dinner. Benton is the reincarnation of that neighborhood bento shop in New York City.Benton's bento boxes are REALLY TASTY. I repeat, REALLY TASTY. You are probably used to shelling out $15 for the Soba Totto or the Sakagura lunch specials. To be honest, I stopped going to Soba Totto or Sakagura for lunch altogether after I discovered Benton. Their lunch specials are just as good, for HALF THE PRICE. It's so amazing, I have no idea how they do it.Every single one of Benton's bento boxes is a carefully curated symphony of flavors - it's crazy how many contrasting tastes they can pack into one bento box - we're talking a main course, rice, plus 3-4 side dishes! The side dishes are truly the stars of the bento - for example, you might see a clump of spinach next to your katsu for lunch, but rest assured, that spinach will certainly not be the plain boiled spinach you eat at home. One day it will be lightly tossed with vinegar, the next you might find a small dallop of sesame dressing at the bottom. Some of the small dishes are simply delightful - they often make these cute little vegetable skewers (we're talking 3 inches long) and then they deep fry the whole thing and pack it into a bento for your dining pleasure. Who does that??? What do YOU eat for lunch? A box of randomly chopped vegetables that cost you $10 at Chopt? A greasy hamburger smashed together over a smoky grill with onions and tomatoes carelessly thrown on top??I really admire the dedication and the time that is simply so evident in Benton's bento boxes. Yes, they may make food ""to go,"" but I would honestly pay double the price for sit down portions of their bentos in a restaurant. Woorijip in Ktown used to a go-to place for packed boxed meals, but I was just at Woorijip last night and it almost makes me angry that Woorijip is such a large establishment and open at all hours, while Benton is a small corner storefront in midtown that's functionally only open for lunch. I'm angry that Woorijip's food is so inferior compared to Benton, and I'm angry that Benton does not get more recognition.Anyways, just go and prepare for your mind to be blown. And it will be, if you know what good Japanese food taste like ;)IF YOU GO:-Benton has amazing (usually some form of sushi donburi) lunch specials on the weekdays. If you want to partake, please go EARLY. They are usually almost out by 1 PM and certainly out any time after that. The bento boxes luckily are not part of the special but they usually run out by 2 PM too.-Not only does Benton have amazing sushi/bentos, their cold noodle/rice bowls offerings are great too! I had the opportunity to try their bibim-noodle (like a bibimbap but with noodles, get it? :P) and their hiyashi chuka (cold noodles with sesame sauce) and both are fantastic! I also like their sauce katsu rice bowl.-They also make hot food (soba, udon, and ramen). I've actually never seen anybody order it because it probably takes some time, but you could try it if you want.-Free miso soup with purchase of bento. Make sure you ask for it! Sometimes the cashier doesn't give it to you unless you ask for it.-They have a rewards program, but it's unfortunately one of the most low-yield reward programs, to the order of something like buy 25 bentos, get 1 free. But still, better than nothing!-They're open on Saturday, but the selection is very small and looks almost like recycled Friday food (even though I'm sure it isn't). I would recommend to pass on Saturday.-They also have bread and onigiri if you don't want a bowl or a boxed lunch :)-Every meal is around $8. Seriously.This is so much text. I can't handle it. Just go. Sparknotes now:- Go on Thurs/Fri lunch and get their chirashis (Friday is better)- Try ANY of their bento boxes- Repeat. Rinse. Fall in love. TRY ALL OF THEM.I had two weeks when I was just studying for my board exams - I had Benton every single day for lunch. I was so happy. I was in love :)",15,0.9992
847,16,12,5.0,"If, by chance, you started a foolish quest to try each of the top 250 beers on Beer Advocate within a calendar year, The Jeffrey would be a frequent source of aid. You might encounter bottles from The Bruery, Maine Beer Co., and even, on rarer occasion, the rarest Belgians. And assuming you're sane enough not to attempt an endeavor so frustrating, the bar remains more than worth the trip. The rotating drafts run the gamut from the accessible (at the moment, Captain Lawrence's Liquid Gold) to the arcane (at the moment, Anderson Valley's The Kimmie, The Yink, and The Holy Gose), and change frequently enough to warrant stopping by more often than your wallet will appreciate. However, what propels The Jeffrey to perfection are the generous, extensive, and thoughtfully curated Growler program (not to mention the loyalty program therein (buy 9 growlers of beer, the tenth is free - after the 30th, get a personalized growler and 15% off for life)), and the fantastic lunch and happy hour specials. Lunch is a mere $10 for a happy hour brew and a sandwich or salad, and none of the food options are afterthoughts. The sandwiches are preposterously good, not in comparison to typical bar fare, but in comparison to standalone sandwich shops. Happy hour is impressive in both the breadth of hours and the depth of beer selections available. People may lament the fact that The Jeffrey is all the way up on 60th and 1st (whiners), but truthfully, the area was in need of a place so objectively great. Being far from the useless hipster masses is just a bonus.",19,0.9875
848,13,9,5.0,"TOP FIVE DINING EXPERIENCEBest steak I ever had, wonderful service, cool yet unpretentious atmosphere.Reservations are not easily had, let's just say they aren't on opentable and you just can't call up- if you get the number. Entering through a door next to a graffiti covered storefront, you have no idea that a Japanese steak place would be at the end of that long hallway- well, yes you do, this is New York and we all know about going through phone booths to get into bars and standing on our heads and spinning three times in front of the Statue Of Columbus to get into Thomas Keller's secret speakeasy underneath the Time Warner Center...oh you didn't know about that one- you should go try it out, let me get my camera.So getting back to Bohemian, it is small- seven tables and a bar for four. As others have pointed out on here, it is like being in someone's living room. The chairs were fine for me, people have mentioned some awkwardness in trying to eat because the chairs were too low or something but I was fine. The service was really great- all smiles all the time, very gracious, made us feel welcome. The food: me and my wife each got the short rib sashimi, the foie gras sushi, we split the smoked bacon, and split a 13 oz waygu strip loin. The first three dishes were all great, and I loved everything- but the steak was not of this earth. It literally melted in my mouth. When you get a porterhouse or a ribeye, sure there is a ton of flavor, but you get a lot of fat and crap you can't eat. Every part of this steak was eaten, there was nothing left over. And I would say that one a scale of 1 to 10, the flavor would be a 9. I've had some steaks that were 10, but again, they would be very fatty or a little chewy. So to have a touch less of that beefy flavor and have a 10 in texture- that is my idea of a perfect steak. Yours might be different, but I guarantee you will love the steak here. And at $73 for 13 oz for a high grade piece- not bad.",11,0.9959

We had the miso ramen - which was decorated beautifully and made so quickly. Also, be sure to ask for complimentary green tea. Goes down so well with ramen.Just note - this place is fairly small (but it includes a bar set up in the front for single seaters so it's great if you're coming alone), so it's not the best place for groups, but they will always try to accommodate.

For example, I bought a chain for a long necklace that was $0.60/ft whereas across the street at Bead Center they sold a similar chain, with cheaper quality, for $3.00/ft. I also bought a chain with an infinity link online (it didn't seem to feel like real metal, felt light and almost plastic like when compared) for a couple of cents cheaper than the infinity link chain I bought at Toho - it was shinier, had a good weight and looked more expensive, for about $1.80/ft.

855,21,11,5.0,"One of the top 5 meals I've ever had. And it wasn't even my birthday. Came here for my roommate's birthday and some friends, for the third installment of our Ron Swanson series. I set up everything through Open Table and we got seated upstairs, near the window, which had a really nice view. The overall atmosphere is very lively, and we were glad that we were placed at a table that was a little less loud. My friends thought I had planned the table placement, but I'll never tell. Anyways, we started off with some drinks, and our server was very chatty and great with recommendations. I went with a Lagavulin, neat, just like Ron Swanson would. Delicious and smokey, and just the right start to our meal.My friends and I each ordered our own steaks and I ordered the sides for the table. We got the mushrooms, potatoes au gratin, creamed spinach, cauliflower, and skillet potatoes. It was crazy because a flock of waitresses came out with the sides and distributed them to our plates for us. My favorite sides were the cauliflower and the spinach. Cauliflower was roasted perfectly and the spinach wasn't too mushy and actually had some texture with all of that cream. All the sides were great, except I probably wouldn't order the skillet potatoes again, because it was like ordering homemade potato chips, which were good, but not $14 good. That being said, out of all of the steakhouses I've been to in New York, the sides at Del Frisco's, as a whole, are probably the best I've ever had. I ordered the prime porterhouse, which was prepared at just the right temperature, and well-seasoned. I tried my friend's ribeye as well, which was delicious, but a bit on the fatty side. But yeah, the steak was great, as expected, and everyone was too happy to talk for awhile. Our waiter kept checking in on us and told us stories about NFL Draft prospects coming in that day (the day before the NFL Draft) and being too scared to order nice things. Those kids. They'll learn soon enough.The waiter caught wind that it was my roommate's birthday and surprised us with a complimentary wedge of lemon cake, which was enormous and delicious. The cake itself was moist, and the frosting had a bit of tang and wasn't too overwhelming. We had to loosen a few belt buckles, but we didn't feel disgusting afterwards, which was great.

Here are some tips:- teamwork is required! Otherwise precious time will be lost- pay attention to the clues from the clue master - there are hints between the lines- think outside of the box- touch and play with everything in the room but don't break anything!- come with a buddy who thinks like you (you are, after all, working with mostly strangers)My competitive spirit definitely emerged among the adrenaline rush. This is a game of patience and creative intellect, so don't try to hulk smash everything/get impatient/give up easily.

862,23,21,5.0,"This place could also be called ""Quantity Italian"".This amazing restaurant has both quality and quantity, a feat that is rarely achieved to such extremes.As a man that loves his quantity almost as much as his quality (or vice versa maybe?), I read about ""The Biggest Chicken Parm in the world"" here on Thrillist and knew I had to come try it immediately. And I did. And it was glorious, from the bread to start to the also over-the-top desserts at the end.The bread they bring you to start is some of the best complimentary bread I've ever had. It is four little segments of steaming hot garlic knots. They bring you olive oil and salt as well, which are unnecessary since they are so deliciously oily and salty already. If I didn't have 10 pounds of chicken to eat coming shortly, I would have definitely asked for more of this.We still of course needed a starter before all the chicken, so we got the Sausage & Pepper Garlic Toast ($13). This was a great starter. It was pretty oily, but it was really delicious. It was like an upscale version of a sausage & peppers hero.And then, the main event: the Chicken Parmigiana ($26 per person = $52). This thing is insane. It is as delicious as it is ridiculous and over-the-top. I feared some quality would be lost with the novelty, but I was luckily wrong - this was some amazingly good chicken parm. The beautifully huge portion, which is served like a pizza pie, from the way it looks down to the way they cut it up into ""slices"" with a pizza cutter, was shockingly neat and well-made.To get through all that chicken, they also give you a small Arugula salad, which was very refreshing. Not so refreshing, but incredibly delicious, were the other sides we ordered. We got the Rigatoni & Meatballs ($12), because you clearly need to have some pasta when you are having chicken parm, and the Corn Creme Brulee ($10). I was thinking we should opt for a vegetable to stave off a heart attack, but our great waiter suggested this as a specialty of theirs using Joey tactics (Corn? Gooood. Creme Brulee? Goooood.), so we had no choice but to try it, and we were not disappointed. This was a crazy dish - it really was like a creme brulee, with the crisp shell on top, and a sweet, soft interior, only it was made of corn. It was delicious.After suffering through my half of the parm pie (I can't believe I ate 4 of those huge slices), we were food drunk and our judgement was obviously impaired, because we ordered two desserts.I was shocked again at the value and quality of these desserts. We got the Coffee Bun Crumble Gelato ($6), which was incredible. They give you a massive amount of gelato for such a nice place as this, and it was really delicious. The cinnamon crumble and candied walnuts complemented the coffee gelato perfectly.And lastly, the Zeppole Workshop ($18), another great, excessive treat. They bring you a massive spread consisting of TEN piping hot zeppole ricotta balls, along with all the accoutrements: honey, melted chocolate, powdered sugar and ricotta gelato. A great, fun treat to end an overly satisfying meal.Along with the amazing food, everything else about this place is perfect too. It's a really nice upscale atmosphere, offset by some good, seemingly out of place hip-hop music. Most of all though, the service was perfect. Our waiter as well as all of the busboys were super polite and friendly, and my glass of water was constantly full, key to combat all that deliciously salty parm.I love this place. I want to come back, but maybe with more than one other person next time to try to conquer that delicious parm and some more great entrees.",27,0.9993
863,16,13,5.0,"Hot damn! I always knew the Frick was considered a sort-of-hidden gem, but I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. It's a small museum--if you take your time at each painting, you can still walk it all in 2-3 hours. It's big enough to wow you--I kept seeing paintings I recognized and thinking, ""I didn't know we had this in NYC, too!""--but small enough not to overwhelm you. Its collection of art spans centuries and is eclectic. I don't think it's heavily frequented by tourists, and it doesn't allow children, so it's pretty peaceful. (I was there on a weekday, though, so that may've contributed to its relative emptiness.)Scattered thoughts:* You won't feel guilty for not reading all the details on the placards by the works, because there are no placards. Most of the works have no notes other than the name and the artist. * If you do want more detail, the audio guides are free. I didn't listen to them but I've heard from others they're detailed and very good.* An introductory movie plays every half hour--it's only ~10 minutes long and is worthwhile. It gives you a brief overview of Herny Clay Frick and how the museum came about. If you're pressed for time, the video plays on the website as well.* Highlights include:- All of the Turners. You can recognize them from across a room, they're so distinctive--bright colors, huge landscapes impressing NATURE upon you, impressionistic swathes (before Impressionism was a thing) mixed in with extraordinarily fine architectural details.* The Fragonard room! These paintings all ought to be kitschy, with their unreal lushness and macaron colors, but they overwhelm you with their skill and exuberance. Also, they are amusingly perverted--just look at the one with the bosomy blond dreamily eyeing the sky while her hand's down between her not-very-subtly spread legs. She's fully clothed in an elaborate dress, but it doesn't change what's happening. You look at this painting and imagine Fragonard had a very good time in his studio.* Rembrandt's The Polish Rider may not be a Rembrandt. Its status is contested.",16,0.9932
864,9,6,5.0,"Let me start out by stating that the $128 pre-fixe menu with three dishes plus desserts is TOTALLY WORTH IT. I chose:Sea Urchin, Black Bread, Jalapeno and Yuzu: generous portion of sea urchin served on top of lightly toasted black bread - they went together very well. I first thought a hint of yuzu on top of sea urchin was a bit weird, but the combination definitely grew on me. Turbot with Chateau Chalon Sauce: this was the first time I've tried turbot and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The fish was only lightly seasoned, but the texture was so soft that I didn't even have to use a knife to cut it. The highlight of the dish was, of course, the chateau chalon sauce! I don't even know what it is made out of, but it was so good that I was practically licking the plate in the end. It went very well with the lightly seasoned fish and made the dish very flavorful yet not overwhelming overall.Duck Breast Topped with Cracked Jordan Almonds: perfectly grilled to medium-rare. The meat went very well with the almond crust on top as well as the sauce on the side. It was possibly one of the best duck dish I've ever had in the city. The portion was quite generous, so I felt very full in the end. For desserts, you get to pick one from chocolate, strawberry, fig and summer special. I went with strawberry since I was craving something light after my heavy duck dish. The sorbet and sponge cake were excellent, but I kind of wish I had picked the chocolate one; my friends seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their warm chocolate lava cake and white chocolate ice cream. The pre-fixe is complemented with several small-bite dishes (broccoli soup, three different kinds of sorbet, etc.) here and there and I was satisfied with every one of them. Even the complimentary bread served in the beginning was great.In sum, this was one of the best fancy dining experiences I've had. I was a bit taken back by the fact that the noise level was higher than I expected (certainly not loud, but not quiet and serene either), but I think in retrospect that it made the overall experience less overwhelming and more enjoyable in the end. Needless to say the service and ambiance were amazing through and through. I highly recommend this place for any special occasion; given the quality and portion of food, the pre-fixe is definitely worth every single penny.",16,0.9988

One of the best things about this city is the abundance of dollar pizza spots, and this one far exceeds others I've been to. It's rare that you'll get a slice that's cold or isn't fresh because they only keep two pies out at a time. The slices are very reasonably sized and really really tasty. In fact, their pizza is better than the $3-$5 dollar slices I've had at some other pizza places. And obviously, the value can't be beat. It's a tiny shop so there's no seating or standing room inside, but most people just stand outside to eat their slice. There's often a line outside the door but it moves really quickly.

871,9,7,5.0,"Eating at Ippudo (Westside or East Village) is a guaranteed wait, but the wait at this location is much more reasonable than that at its sister location. My co-worker (""D"") and I strolled over from our office and arrived just before 6 pm, to find ourselves with a 30 minute wait time.. unheard of (in a good way)! So naturally, we decide to order a bottle of sake* to nurse while I scoped out the restaurant. The space is definitely smaller than I expected, but I loved the view and layout of the communal table in the first dining area. The second adjoining room of the restaurant has the more standard seating arrangement (i.e. tables and booths accommodating 2-6). All in all, the interior was sleek, tasteful, and better-lit than the sister restaurant in East Village.Once we got seated, our friendly server runs us through the menu and the day's specials. Collectively, the three of us (including the waitress on this one) decide to order:- Lobster Hasami (Special of the Day) -- lobster claw with maitake mushroom, celery puree, yuzu pepper meringue, and ikasumi sauce (squid ink miso reduction): D and I couldn't stop raving about this dish. That puree and meringue was interesting... and amazing!- Tako Wasabi: I don't know how I never got around to trying this, as D tells me it's on the EV menu as well. It had just the right amount of wasabi to pair with and accent the fresh octopus.- Pork Hirata Buns: They were as succulent and tender as I remember (hooray for consistency!), but as I was telling D, the buns are now considered a given in the Ippudo dining experience. A staple that I won't ever stop ordering, but it lacks the excitement a good ""new"" dish provides.- Miyazaki Wagyu Steak: OH.EM.GEE. (I'm salivating as I write this) This was the best dish of the night, hands down, for both D and I. The slivers of steak were cooked to a perfect medium-rare, accompanied by a trio of dipping options (salt, wasabi soy, and something more ponzu-esque). So tender, so juicy, so delicious. The price ($28) is a bit steep for an appetizer and the portion too small to be an entree, but worth every goddamn cent. Our waitress gave us the 411 on this beef and apparently Per Se uses the same source/distributor and prices it at 4x the price. GET IT, GET IT, GET IT! I can't say it enough!- Karaka men (with Nitamago): The spicy ramen in pork broth had so much flavor, with a good spicy kick. The texture of the noodles are to die for (as always) and perfect for soaking up the broth.Needless to say, a VERY satisfying meal. D says he was pleasantly pleased to find Ippudo Westside as good as Ippudo EV and that he & I will be going back as often as we can.

872,16,16,5.0,"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways:1.) Location, location, location. Propped next to Harlem Public, it's a hard choice to choose between these two places, even though I know their homies with each other. (I see the love fests on Twitter. Haaa.) Still, how nice is it to have some awesome new bars popping up in West Harlem, thus saving us kids that live in Upstate Manhattan constant trips downtown? VERY nice. 2.) The drink selection is excellent, not overwhelming, and inexpensive. Two cans of hard cider, a shot of whiskey, and a few fingers of Glenlivit only put my tab up to $33. Those ain't downtown prices, quite happily. 3.) An amazing jukebox is filled with interesting, varied, yet oddly complimentary choices. I'm talking Pharcyde, Common, Mos Def, Bloc Party, ""Aquemini""-era Outkast, Fleetwood Mac, The Kinks, ""Paul's Boutique"", and so on. I found a dollar on the floor and I'd like to thank whomever dropped it. I picked ""Ms. Fat Booty"" and ""Bombs Over Baghdad"", and those choices were met with universal approval from fellow patrons; as for the latter, two girls next to me started screaming and dancing when Andre 3000 started spitting his first few verses. That made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, aside from the 48 ounces of hard cider inside of me.4,) The space and interior design are amazing. They worked with the space quite interestingly. The bar has a gorgeous curve that juts into the main area, and there is additional smaller table near the rear. The entrance also boasts what's best described as bleacher seating, just two rows of seats to just post up and chill on. The rear holds a game area with table hockey and the biggest freaking game of Jenga you've ever seen, surely. It took a little getting used to the sound of the blocks falling, but soon, the beau and his friend and I were watching from the bar, cheering everyone playing on! 5.) The bathrooms have the best feature of any bathroom I've ever seen in a bar, and I'm not talking about the dry erase walls and markers they encourage patrons to use. I'm talking about locks that indicate if a bathroom is vacant or occupied. In bars that are noisy, it can be annoying to knock on a door to see if someone is in it, and it's simply awkward to be unsure if you heard anyone and pull on the handle. Thank you, At The Wallace, for being so damn smart and putting those locks in! (Now it's just up to patrons to actually lock them when they're in there. Ha!) As for the dry erase markers, I had to separate the fact that I've worked in Infection Control for 5+ years and could only imagine the germs on those markers. Hey, it's all about building up immunity, right? Ha! So I allowed myself a little bit of fun with the markers, but definitely washed my hands for 20 seconds afterwards.My only gripe, one that can be easily fixed? The bar was almost constantly wet. Bartenders whipping out drinks were spilling and not wiping. That can be easily fixed with a towel, however. It just sucked that I ended up with wet elbows and a wet phone on occasion. Heh. But, if you can't handle getting a little wet at a bar once in a while...hahaha...The older and wiser I get about establishments in and around this fine city, the more hesitant I am to give out five star reviews on Yelp.

After checking in, we were informed by the host that we had to wait a little because the table before us was lingering. Fine, NBD. Wouldn't be a Chelsea restaurant without a wait. ;-)During that wait time, we talked about the decor, looked over the Morimoto cookbook that was on display, took photos, until we realized that 45 minutes had passed. We were getting a little impatient and the host was kind enough to treat us for drinks for our wait. Could we really be bought by alcohol? The answer is ABSOLUTELY. The boys got beers, while a few of us got this delicious Bulleit Bourbon cherry drink that was sososososooso delicious. Bourbon's the best (next to scotch). Finally, an hour later, and after the host profusely apologized, we were sat. Was this wait ridiculous? Yes, but I noted to my friend that I could not fault the restaurant too much for it because they were so kind to us (even treated us to some appetizers that were brought nearly immediately after we sat because we loved since were absolutely starving) and thoughtful. The appetizer thing - I couldn't think of anything more comforting than being able to eat SOMETHING immediately after sitting down. We were gracious, because probably we would have been really upset had they not gone to all the trouble to make us feel better. As far as food goes, I ordered the surf and turf ($39) that composed of a wagyu skirt steak and hamachi ribbons, herbed potatoes (that were to die for - I couldn't believe potatoes could taste THIS good), crushed citrus & avocado. The hamachi ribbons were prepared tableside (which was cute and quick). I also split the veggie of the day (sunchoke with pesto for $8) with a friend, and it was the perfect combination. My friend Jodi ordered the Sushi plate (the $45 size) and was pleased by all the fresh sushi choices on her plate. Tran ordered the chirashi sushi, which was a HUGE portion of fresh fish. It was $33, probably the least expensive dish, yet came in a gigantic bowl and had about 10-12 things inside. She was absolutely stuffed.

The sangria here is awesome, actually some of the best (and strongest) I've had. I ordered the Havana Banana, Punta Cana and Tropical- in that order. But I tried the Spanish Harlem, Fresas and Roja- in that order. Hey, it's unlimited people. Don't judge.Oh snap, I was so sangria happy I almost forgot about the food. We ordered the Gallitos for two and it definitely hit the spot. I strongly suggest this if you're looking for a light but fulfilling meal. But people, that complimentary bread was a WINNER! I asked our waiter for details, he told us how it was made and the country it was from. Sadly, I don't remember anything.I'm coming back, and I'm coming with a group.",20,0.9898

I'm a fan of their blood soup - not the best summer choice, I know - a hearty[1] treat. Their jaeyook bokum - spicy pan-fried pork with veggies - is also filling.Whatever you get, their banchan will keep you amused. And you get yogurt drinks for dessert. Free. Their kimchi is also cut generously, and fermented for maximum impact.Muk Eun Ji is a low-key spot for any meal, lunch or otherwise. They sport lunch specials, and last I was there, they had check-in specials too. Fast kitchen, fast service.

I met my friend here on a Wednesday evening, and we were able to grab a table just for drinks. Bartender was great, and explained all he was putting into the drink. I had the Summer Kiss, a tequila-based, citrus-y drink with blackberries and egg whites- I'm a sucker for any drink made with egg whites. Light, frothy and delicious. My friend had the Southern Fraise, a sweet Vodka cocktail with fresh muddled strawberries. The attention the bartender put into each drink was impressive for sure. The bar has live jazz often without a cover (though we unfortunately missed this), but wonderful jazz music playing in the background at any rate. Check out the old jazz books and records in the back. There also seems to be a private room that holds large parties.Will be back often.",13,0.9764

There's a number of reasons to visit this place:1) Because I said so!2) The only place you'll find Earl Grey macarons in town... the world?3) They have a Cheetos flavored macaron... cheetos. It's one of those combinations you never expect to go together until you try it, like nutella on pizza or nutella & sex, they're all delicious combinations. Fun Fact: The most popular edible lingerie flavor is Cherry. Chocolate being the least.4) They hold macaron making classes. Pretty fun.5) They make custom-made macarons. To name a few: Hello Kitty, Ghostbusters, & their cat (I believe his name was Mr. Socks or Captain Socks). Sometimes it's too cute, you almost feel guilty eating it... almost.   OH! Also, they were listed as one of the top 5 Macaron spots in NY, they were also acclaimed for their Blondies. I haven't tried one myself because I'm always too distracted by the macarons.",12,0.9864

From the Ukranian Flag hanging outside to the waiters & waitresses dressed in traditional garb, it was a great and fun-filled eating experience.The television has some Ukranian old school movies playing and the entire place has different Ukranian decour around it. Unlike the also locale Onegin (Russian ""Fusion""), this place totally took the ethnic theme and rolled with it.I came in with a groupon, which was a really good deal and came with 2 cold appetizers, 2 warm appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 drinks. The waiter came by and gave some A + recommendations.We started with Roasted pork with garlic. It was quite tasty, be careful with the horseradish sauce though ;0. Also had the Olivier salad which consisted of Boiled Chicken Filet, Potatoes, carrots, and eggs and tasted similar to a potatoey coleslaw, also hit the spot!Round 2 was the Potato draniki, which was essentially 4 potatoe Latkas with sour cream, it was hannukah for my taste buds! t was cooked just right. The third round was Lean borsch (picked over the one with veal). I must say, for a usual non-fan of Borsch this hit the spot. It was just the right mix of beetroot, onion, carrot, and sweet peppers with potatoes. Oh and more sour cream ;0.The final course was Pork shish kebab & Chicken A la Kiev. The Shish Kebab was tasty, but a little salty for my tastes. The chicken A la Kiev I was a bigger fan of, as it was crispy and rolled around butter and herbs. The side salad was a nice touch too.I almost forgot, the drinks. How can you go to a Ukranian Place without Vodka! The deal came with an infused vodka shot, and I chose the lindenberry one, it seemed to be almost more than 1 shot and was on the strong side, but tasted great and I'm not one to complain about too much alcohol.Overall, the service was good and this is the type of place where you don't want them to rush the food out, but bring it out gradually course by course. On exiting the girl in the front stopped us and offered us 2 free shots, with a cucumber. A great final touch for a fun evening in Kiev.... oops I mean SoHo. ;0.",18,0.9936

The layout and vibe is even similar to that of Third Floor (why yes, I did get confused the first time I went). After 11 PM, you get the packed drunken crowd, but the reason why this is a gem is that sweet spot during dinner when things are quiet, the waiters are attentive, and the kitchen has time to do what they do best.First up, the side dishes. There's only one big side dish but don't be fooled! It's a great light mixture of acorn jelly, daikon, and chives. And let me tell you, the pickled veggies here are THE BEST. If you're a fan of the pickled, sour, been-in-the-ground-for-centuries taste, you will hate it. But if you like the fresh, slightly flavored and spicy, pickled goods with that crunch, this place will be your best friend. Ask for the picked green peppers too. You'll become addicted.They make sure the food is hot and all dishes came out on heat stands. The pajeon wasn't overly oily, was crispy, and yes - kimchi was fresh, lightly grilled to perfection. Now top that with the pickled green peppers+sauce and you've got yourself a winner! And you don't have to worry about the food getting cold!Apparently the owner of this place also owns Pocha (?) so of course we got the budae chigae (what else would you get?!) And true to its promise comes a big pot with noodles and just fresh everything! I think this is why I love this place: it tastes so fresh - the seafood, the veggies, heck even the ramen noodles! The portion is smaller than pocha and there's no ludicrous amounts of cheese, but - wait for it- they make fried rice out of the leftovers of the soup. MINDBLOWN - WAIT WHAT?! You think you're full, then comes this fried rice from the amazing soup that you just had, and if you love the crispy crunchy rice at the bottom of the rice cooker, that's what you're going to get. Apparently they load it up with cheese, so if you don't think you'll like that - ask for the fried rice without it.You get a side of rice free before 8 PM...but it's not just ""rice"". It's a huge heaping pile of jasmine with an egg and seaweed flakes on top. MIND. BLOWN.The bo ssam was so so. Though tender and well cooked, it lacked flavor and was a bit bland.

No, I'm not talking about the penetrating stare and inappropriate growl you received from that passing cyclist on the street... you're actually paying for this one.My favorite thing about live shows, is that performers have the ability to break the fourth wall. Comedians smoothly conjure up jokes about select audience members under pressure. (Let the Asian jokes commence!) The Stand has plenty of comedians lined up each show. It just isn't stand up comedy without inappropriate, sexist, and stereotypical monologues. The Stand's comedians are always sharp and creative: Wyatt Cenak, Pete Davidson, Rachel Feinstein, and Sherrod Small are some of my favorites. Most comedy clubs in NYC reel patrons in with a very affordable ticket but conveniently forget to mention a two drink minimum requirement... per person. Alcoholic, at that! The Stand is honest, you get what you pay for. It's $20 admission at the door per person and $15 online. They usually have amazing vouchers available for purchase on Groupon, LivingSocial, or Gilt City. The space at The Stand is perfectly intimate but comfortable. Service from check in to check out is extremely organized. Friday night shows are packed but I have never felt flustered. They have a very diverse and creative cocktail menu designed by mixologists from Minetta Tavern. Their cocktails are mixed with an eclectic of ingredients and tastefully garnished. They have an ample amount of servers on the floor so you can expect to receive consistent customer service all night. Their menu is a mixture of small plates of comfort and bar food. You can count on The Stand for steady streams of laughter. Well, unless the joke is made at your expense.Some Pro Tips: Let loose and laugh at everything.

They have an extremely fresh taste to them and they are quick. It is as if the items used to prepare the food were harvested or slaughtered earlier that morning. I can recall going to visit Los Tacos soon after getting both of my lower wisdom teeth removed. Did I know I was in for a challenge? Yep, sure did! Not a care was given!

Everything on the menu looks good. I got wither the second or third dosa on the menu and it was delicious. Next time I would get the jaffna curry. We waited in line for almost 20 minutes and normally I would take a star off but they have ginger beer cans that I used to drink in Sri Lanka so I was a happy camper.

But be forewarned, you have to have some knowledge of yoga before coming here. I came here for a 6:30pm Open class. The receptionist checked me in quickly, gave me a tour around and explained everything to me. They have a cafe in the studio, so that is cool. They also sell tons of merch (if that's your thing). The locker room is basically only for changing and they have one shower stall. The bathrooms are separate (good idea, alleviates congestion). No lockers really, so take your things into the class. Make sure you also take all your clothes with you too (that's what the receptionist recommended, which means clothes have disappeared), yikes! That would suck to come back and your clothes were gone. Water fountain right outside the changing room. The yoga practise room is big, can probably fit 40 or more yogis. My class wasn't that packed, so we could all spread out. Our instructor was amazing. She started off with some singing and harmonium playing. And then read an excerpt from her lessons. And the theme was ""what is your identity?"" Got me thinking about that, cool. The practise was challenging and I really enjoyed the challenge. It was very humid the night I went, and so I was sweating profusely. The instructor noticed and came over and rubbed menthol into my neck and back. That really helped to cool me down. She also stretched me out nicely in reverse warrior. She wedged my knee into her legs and kept me stable and kept my knee from bending inward, that helped a lot. I appreciate when an instructor can see your limits and just push you that much further. I reached another level with this instructor. This class is definitely about proper alignment and the further I get into yoga, the more I am aware of how important alignment is. If you don't align correctly, you can get injured. The class ended after 75 minutes. And I have to say the final Oms we chanted were some of the most beautiful. Our instructor has a beautiful voice. I will def be back regardless if I have a pass or not. Just be prepared to work and to reap the rewards later.",30,0.9906
894,15,9,5.0,"Hidden and tucked in a basement level floor, Bangia is a very typical Korean joint, though you're in for a great night here. Expect full authenticity when it comes to their service, food, and drink. There could be the potential for some language barriers, so it certainly helps to have a guest who speaks the native tongue, but not required. Their pricing is right, they have plenty of TVs for sports loving folks, there's a full bar, many tables/seats to go around, great food menu. They have the right setup and atmosphere for larger parties. For a night of full-blown eating and drinking, Bangia is definitely the spot to check out. Bangia is all about drinking and eating, more eating and more drinking. And, repeat. Order bottles of soju and two or more of their appetizing dishes, ideally meant to be shared with another or amongst a group. Their dishes come large in portion. We came as a group of three, split four bottles of soju, along with two large platters -- The marinated Pork Feet and the Seafood Dukbokki (spicy rice cake with seafood resting in spicy sauce and tons of mozzarella). This is clearly Korean comfort food at its best. The pork feet was delicious, though the ultimate, clear winner was the Seafood Dukbokki. Simply amazing. No doubt, their dukbokki is a must-try. The preparation is wonderful, portion is more than generous, and it's just an incredibly satisfying comfort food dish. This was perhaps the best dukbokki I've experienced in Ktown. It's loaded with seafood, mozzarella, and rice cake. The ingredients were all in balance. I have no complaints regarding the food. Some negatives, however -- The service can be a bit slow. Servers do come around quite often, so you can wave them over should you need something. Because their dishes are on the larger side, expect at least 20 minute wait or more on preparation. Otherwise, no outstanding issues to note. Bangia is simply the perfect casual, no-frills Ktown spot for binge eating and drinking. I'll be sure to return again for many, many bottles of soju and their mind-blowing Seafood Dukbokki.",17,0.9983

896,14,17,5.0,"You know what I might like the most about 11B? The name. Maybe every bar and restaurant should take a page from the 11B playbook and just name itself after its location. Then, maybe one day, I could have the pleasure of texting one of my degenerate friends the name of a bar or restaurant to meet at without getting the response, ""ok where is it?"" every freaking time, like they aren't already holding a device that would have answered that question in less time than it took them to text me that. Ah yes, let me Google that for you...YOU LAZY PIECE OF SH*T.Speaking of my very special friends, 11B has become our unofficial Friday Night Family Dinner gathering spot. Besides being one of the only dining establishments that my friends can locate on a map, it's also BYOB - so, like, holy crap. ...God? is that you?.... And now, I must interrupt with a public service message: In case you haven't noticed, BYOB restaurants in Manhattan are becoming an endangered species. It's like that old saying - Manhattan without BYOB is like a yellow Porsche without a douchebag behind the wheel. It just doesn't make sense. I can't keep all of the remaining BYOB places in business by myself, okay? Everyone needs to step up and be a regular patron at one of Manhattan's remaining BYOB establishments...BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. Because if 11B ever falls off the BYOB wagon or implements an inflated corkage fee (which is basically just as bad), the guilt won't be on MY shoulders, ya hear?Lastly, I want to give a shout-out to the badass owner of 11B, Vinny Sgarlato - who will probably claim not to know me after reading this review, but it wouldn't be the first time that's happened. In all seriousness, Vinny's personal investment in this restaurant is obvious, and I think that many restaurant owners & managers could learn a lot from him. Recently, my friends & I ended up being the last table there (...shocking...) and Vinny sat down and had a conversation with us (we got to talking about Yelp reviews, actually).

897,12,8,5.0,"**Dinner review**Upstate gets 4.5 stars, rounded way, way up. My sister and I arrived around 9:30pm Saturday evening and was given a 1 hour wait - we were also last on the list of names, pretty much, before the kitchen closed at 11. The hostess man texts when your table is ready, but we opted to stick around the area and were outside when our table was ready at about 10:15pm - was so, so, SO excited!Famished and overly excited, I proceeded to order too much food, but not really, since we managed to scarf it all down.The oysters - 5/5 - I probably could have eaten 20 of these by myself. I know nothing about oysters so I told the waiter tell me about each of them.  Ended up with a couple larger east coast oysters and a west coast oyster... they were so fresh and so delicious.Crab cakes - 4/5 - that spicy honey arugula salad was to die for. The crab cakes were meh - nothing beats a Maryland crab cake and these weren't comparable, sadly. Still delicious, but not anywhere near comparable to the best crab cakes I've ever had. Would liked to see bigger crab chunks.Steamed clams - 6/5 - if I could give more than 5 stars, this would get it. Those clams were way bigger than I was expecting and they were tender and oh-so-juicy. The beer broth was salty and flavorful and they gave you bread to soak in the yumminess. I'd come back to Upstate every week just for these.Scallop entree - 5/5 - grilled over a bed of squash, zucchini, and mushrooms. Sis had this dish and she loved it. I had a bite of the scallops, grilled to perfection and the veggies, which were a nice and simple filler for the meal.Clam fettuccine - 3/5 - sadly, my least favorite of the night. After seeing many good reviews, I guess I was hyped up and ready for some deliciousness. I was hoping for something more like the Italian clam linguine, but it was not. I guess I'm not much of a fan of fettuccine pasta to begin with, but the extra super buttery sauce with the breadcrumbs, onions, and cheese just didn't do it for me. The bread stuff kind of reminded me of my favorite Stouffer's tv dinner dish, so maybe that's what ruined it for me. The smaller clams were delicious, though.Complimentary whiskey cake - 5/5 - if you're a fan of whiskey, this stuff is for you. You can definitely taste the whiskey in this - reminds of the the Jamaican rum cake from my cruise ship days.Despite a couple hiccups in a couple of the dishes, I still loved this place and know I will love this place the next time I go back and try some other stuff - that is, when I feel like waiting for an hour+ for dinner again.",17,0.9977

I came here after enjoying a few tapas somewhere else so I didn't order much and I regret this. I wish I could've stretched my stomach out three times so I could get a taste of everything the Black Ant had to offer.First off, I love the feel of this place. There is outdoor seating for those who want to bask in the summer sun, and the vibe out here cannot be more different than the one inside. The inside is very dark and trendy. The walls are covered in different types of art, all centered around ants. In the back there is a really funky one with many colors. On the side walls there are tiles of golden ants. The decor is beautiful, without being over the top, and I really enjoyed admiring them while waiting for my food to come out.I had the cucumber margarita, which while nothing special was a good drink, very refreshing. I also had the Huarache de Nopal( $12), which is grilled cactus pad, black mission figs, asadero cheese, pilonsillo chilhuacle marmalade. This sounds a lot fancier than it is, but it was very good, especially all the asadero cheese on the bottom. I've never had such good cactus. It was prepared well, but if you aren't a big fan of vegetarian dishes, I could not recommend this one. Instead, I would recommend the Una con Todo ($8), which is a bucket of chorizo, pork belly, yuca fries, and cheese cochoyotes with a side of tabiche salsa. The salsa was super flavorful, packed an amazing punch to otherwise bland ingredients. But wow, the chorizo and pork belly were mind blowing. So tender, my teeth pierced right through it. Better pork belly than Ippudo (which is a big compliment). The little yuca fries had an amazing texture and were fun to eat.

So I was really hoping for great things from this place.Whoa.First of all, if a place has lychee flavored sorbet & Thai iced tea flavored ice cream, I'm already going to give it a chance. Exotic and unique flavors are a must. Must be different from the grocery store flavors. Mind was blown. There was no taste testing.

900,10,5,5.0,"This is only the second location for this popular Brooklyn-based bake shop that opened a few days ago on 125th Street. Their advertisement mentions that they're the former staff of the legendary baker ""Cakeman Raven."" When I stopped by over the weekend it was only their second day doing business and they still had a few noticeable touches to make both the inside and outside of the shop. Nevertheless, they seemed to still be pretty well stocked and ready to introduce Harlem to their cakes. They were even giving out samples right outside. I should mention that it's a pretty small shop with no inside seating and just a few seats outside for those who prefer to sit and eat rather than take their cake on the road. And as far as I can tell they basically just sell cakes, cupcakes and ice cream. Prices are low with slices of cake going for six dollars and three dollars for cupcakes. Not bad at all.I've already heard a lot of talk about their Brooklyn shop, so I'm looking forward to adding this place to my list of regular neighborhood drop-in spots.  So far, I've only had a slice of their signature red velvet cake, but I enjoyed it very much and felt that it well exceeded my expectations. The cake and frosting were both surprisingly very light, and not too sweet--perfectly balanced. And the slices are really big too. I'd have to say that for me it was probably the best red velvet cake that I'd tasted anywhere, which means that I'll be dropping in again soon.",9,0.9692
901,13,8,5.0,"Zhà-Mi or Asian fried rice balls is the Asian interpretation to what gastro-fiends like most of us know as the (Italian) arancini. Zhà Pan Asian has come up with a winning formula to bridge two worlds of flavor. I tried their fare at (pardon the pun) Hester Street Fair while coming here on the second week of the Fair's opening. Their staff is friendly and on-point with suggesting choices that work with my palate. Coincidentally, one of the owners (Steve) who worked the event that day touched on how they came upon this idea.The rice balls we ordered were fried to perfection. Crispy on the outside, flavorful and moist on the inside without leaving a greasy taste that normally would accompany fried foods. I have one word: YUM. Embedded in each were Thai Chicken Curry, Chinese BBQ Pork, Korean BBQ Beef and Tofu with curry sauce. Yes, practically bought several of each. My favorite had to have been KBBQ Beef (Bulgogi) not b/c of my affinity for Korean BBQ but that of how the meats were marinated.The open air venue makes for a very low pressure purchase. Nibble or nom, the choice is yours... but I'm also been made aware that they operate within another storefront during other seasons in the EV (East Village). If you don't find your way to the Fair in time, look them up. You'll probably find them established in another store or pop-up since people have taken notice. It's been cited by NBC, Village Voice, Twitter (I won't mention celebrity names).My only regret was having missed their Korean Fried Chicken & Waffles, which sold out earlier that day... (Ugh, talk about heartbreak!) Hopefully I'll be able to revisit for that next time.",15,0.5974

Super cozy and our waiter was VERY attentive. Odd thing though, the decor does not match the whole french vibe. All three of us were a little confused. Although the setting was quite intimate, we felt like we were in one of those ""wants to be trendy"" Thai restaurants (think Spice). Besides that, FOOD was delicious and they were all small portions so we had many dishes to choose from and try. My favorite dishes that we shared were the escargot (so good we got 2!), chicken liver mousse (this was my absolute FAVORITE!! I couldn't get enough and goes perfectly with the bread in the sack), and the 6 oz filet mignon with fries (entree dish - medium rare and cooked to perfection!). The other things we ordered were ok, but those three were my top choices. One awesome thing about this spot is their wine flight happy hour from 5-7! 3 SUPER generous glasses of wine for $10! There are a few options to choose from, but I loved my choice (can't remember the name, but it had a rose wine among the three).I HAD THE BEST BIRTHDAY DINNER HERE and CANNOT WAIT TO COME BACK!! :)",14,0.9964
903,10,7,5.0,"Boyfriend and I had a very nice time here tonight. Good food, good drinks, good service, good space. We both went for the massive Heisenburger, which was 10 ounces of meaty Pat LaFrieda goodness topped with caramelized onions, house-made pickles, lettuce, tomato and your choice of cheddar or Swiss. I had no idea the name was a Breaking Bad reference, since I've managed to avoid watching a single episode of the show, but that did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of what was a hell of a burger. Thick, juicy, and perfectly cooked, this was the best burger I've had in quite awhile.Boyfriend also ordered fries, which I opted to skip, considering the burger behemoth I was about to consume (so massive, in fact, that we were initially asked if we intended it split it). In a thoughtful touch, the kitchen split the fries evenly between our two baskets.Wednesday through Labor Day they are hosting ""Owl Hour"" from 6-8, with tea-infused cocktails for just a nickle. You can only get one, but the full price is still a very reasonable $8! They were using a ""Pink and Black"" Owl Brew mixer, and had three drinks to choose from. An excellent, slightly spicy lime and cilantro drink was the most inventive, but a fruity white wine ""santeá"" was also quite good and went down a little easier. The third option was pink and black mixed with bourbon, which was surprisingly smooth. I'll admit I didn't have the highest of hopes for a tea cocktail mixer, but I'm officially a fan. Overall, there was a nice, casual vibe, bustling, but not overly crowded. The staff seemed totally friendly and efficient. I was also impressed to see the chef/owner, Chris, tending bar and taking orders. I imagine it might get pretty busy on the weekends, but it's good to know there's a cool, reasonably-priced place in the Meatpacking District.",11,0.9974

905,15,6,5.0,I was looking for a Mexican brunch spot to host my hubs milestone birthday brunch since his bday falls on the day of the dead. Ofrenda didn't flinch when I said i had 30-35 guests for a Saturday afternoon brunch. We arrived at 11:30am and all stayed till close to 4. Took over their entire outdoor seating since the weather was perfect for dining al fresco. We literally ordered everything on their brunch menu 3 times over. Guacomole was a huge hit as a starter and the inventive drinks kept coming and were delicious.

Yeah, it's cheap boxed wine, but I'm a college student, so I have grown accustom to it haha.Not only was the free wine awesome, but the food we had was awesome as well. There was 3 of us and we shared the Szechuan dumplings, chow fun with shrimp, chicken with three different nuts, and the mixed Chinese vegetables. I have been craving their Szechuan dumplings since I left. They were in a delicious peanut sauce with hot oil. We contemplated getting another order, they were that addictive. I used the leftover sauce to pour over the white rice that came with our entrees....such a good decision. The chicken with three different nuts was definitely my next favorite. The glazed walnuts were my favorite part and added some sweetness to the dish. I didn't have much of the chow fun but the mixed Chinese vegetables were a great choice to sort of balance out the other dishes.This place really hit the spot after a long day of apartment hunting. I would probably come here all the time if it wasn't all the way in the UWS. We were in the area to see Celebrity Autobiography. Service was nice and friendly and the prices are cheap (bill for 3 people was under $40). They refilled our wine supply at the table multiple times without us asking and even when we were paying the check...a smart idea to get us feeling more generous!",13,0.9978

This reminds me, I need to regale them with stories of how I grew up with no iPad and only Mint Chocolate Chip. They love those stories.After agonizing over choices like Salted Pretzel and Salt & Pepper Pinenut I opted for Salted Chocolate.

Here are some top reasons. 1. The SOUP Bar - If you're in the mood for some organic soup that's cooked on-site daily, this is a great spot to pick some up. My personal favorite is their beef stew. Great vegetarian and vegan options. When you feel daring, try mixing a few together.2. Non-Dairy Ice-cream-ish Desserts - This market has some really delicious dairy free frozen desserts, including cashew milk ice cream, almost milk ice cream, and sorbets galore. 3. Samples - If you're curious they've got samples. Every day it seems like there is something new. Try something different and pick up whatever they are selling. The nice thing about this market is that they give the little guys a shot. I've met a lot of potential up and coming companies who come in here to get feedback and let customers try their items. 4. LOCAL, when they can, they seem to have locally grown veggies. If the Greenmarket is closed, this is a great spot to pop into.5. Juice Bar + Premade items - this is a GREAT quick solution to being hungry, and staying healthy. It's hard to cram in a good healthy meal when you're in a hurry.

We were greeted by a host in a suit with a leather reservation book at his desk. Despite the fact that we were an hour early for our reservation for 4, they were happy to accommodate us. The COO in our midst was pleased that he could check his luggage since the tables themselves are quite small.Before we even ordered, there were green beans and noodles delivered to the table (presumably complimentary) and portioned onto the smaller top of two plates stacked on top of each other. We ordered a bottle of red and a bottle of white which were expertly served by one of our many waiters. At some point the manager came by to tell us that every server is here to accommodate us, so if we need anything we should simply ask. Everyone was suuper friendly. We started with an order of vegetable dumplings and the dumpling sampler (shrimp, chicken, etc). Each dumpling appetizer had six per order. Being that I was a vegetarian, the restaurant served each of us a mixed plate with, of course, only vegetable on mine. They were steamed and soft, but didn't fall apart when lifted off the plates with chopsticks. The dumpling sauce was yummy, but a bit watery. I liked the fact that the table setting included both chopsticks and forks. No presumption or shame either way.My dinner order was the vegetable ratatouille. Big chunks of tomato and broccoli and onion over thin pasta strands. Yum. We ordered a side of spicy broccoli for the table and that was really delicious.

There were definitely four to five other people milling about outside since we were about 10 minutes early before they opened for the night. This isn't my first rodeo. I will say I have never been to the original location, so I don't have much to compare it to, but I was pumped up anyway. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Sasha Petraske, so how could this possibly be bad? My friend and I were greeted by the friendly host and seated right away at one of their tables up front. Perfecto. As is the Milk & Honey tradition, we were not given menus, only asked what sort of cocktails we love most. I went with my classic ""Ahhhh, I love Old Fashioneds, a little sweet, cardamon, clove, cinnamon flavors...yeah"". The mixologist had no problem at all creating something I loved, which is no shock to anyone that has ever been mixed a drink by one of Sasha's mixologists. That guy doesn't mess around with his staff. My friend loved her drink, too. We sipped on a few more, each time the mixologist changed up our drinks slightly which kept it fresh and interesting, and our waiter would explain all the ingredients in detail and how it was crafted. So I loved it so much I went back a second time, which comes as no shock to any of you. This time with the same friend. She's so fun. We sat at the bar this time and had no problem getting a seat. She was considering it for a private party so we looked around the back room which is super cozy and great. Our drinks this time were just as good as the first time, and completely different, which I love. I went back a third time for my aforementioned friend's birthday party. She had rented out the back for cocktails and small bites. What a pleasure. They did have menus this time, but with the basis for all their cocktails. You could order off the menu, or have them craft you a personalized cocktail. Shockingly, it didn't take forever for your drink to arrive, either, which was awesome. The staff was so friendly and nice. Everything we asked them for, they provided. We brought in our own cupcakes, which they happily served on platters. The food was very simple, but very tasty. Actually, really smart drinking food. Miniature sandwiches with prosciutto and brie, and others with apple, honey and brie. There were also salmon deviled eggs and a bruschetta, but those sandwiches were pretty good. Nothing too special, but good little bites to help soak up all that bourbon.Smart bar bites and amaze cocktails are completely my jam, so now I'm coming up with reasons to throw my own party there ASAP.

Thank you EMP hostess for not making fun of me or making me feel like a total moron. They kept wishing us a happy anniversary the whole night and I swear they must have googled Brian because they remember he worked in the same building as EMP. We've both been to our fair share of Michelin restaurants in NYC and EMP is definitely in the top three. The amount of work the staff puts into explaining the dishes and the time they take to lay out the silverware in between each new dish is extraordinary. I accidentally moved my fork and someone immediately came over to put it back into its proper place. I kid you not! This may all sound super uppity, but the earnestness of the staff makes it feel completely casual in a way. I never once felt uncomfortable even though I'm sure I was sitting close to some crazy high roller on a date who kept ordering bottle after bottle of wine. At the end of the night, they gave us Mast Brothers chocolate covered pretzels to take home. I devoured mine right away and attempted to steal Brian M.'s as well. Before we left, our waiter came by with a box full of the chocolate covered pretzels for us to take home. Amazing!

It was the name of the eatery soon to be replacing it: ""Old Tbilisi."" I rubbed my mind's eyes in disbelief. Whaaaaa? A Georgian restaurant on Bleecker Street? (For many years, and until the last couple, you'd have to go to Kings Highway, Avenue U, or Brighton Beach in Brooklyn to get some decent Georgian food, not counting all the pan-Soviet places that infuse their menus with dishes from the Caucuses.) But signs don't lie. Not with the rents you pay to open up a business in this part of town. Ever since that day, I kept watch on the windows, watching Old Tbilisi gestate from occupancy permit to posted menu to, this past week, open for business.As soon as I saw the open doors and the waitstaff...well, waiting for diners in the doldrums of the very early evening, I lined up the SO and my brother for an exploratory trip. As soon as we entered, we were told that they didn't have their booze license yet, in case that would influence our decision to partake. We went in with this very expectation, but I appreciated the full disclosure (I'm sure it saves restaurants aggravation with folks complaining after they sit down). It should be noted that there is no BYOB option due to recent changes in the law, which I have seen with other places that opened in the past year, but they will have full booze soon*. They already had a couple of diners there and luckily there was still room in the nice garden in the back. We walked past the bar area and long dining room (some changes have been made since Slide times). There was a large stone waterfall fountain that actually looked fairly real (these can look quite tacky sometimes).Then our feast began. My brother was there for one thing above all: the khachapuri. They have a couple of varieties but the one he wanted was Khachapuri Adjarian (straight-out-the-oven Georgian bread with an ""open lid"" in the center filled with delicious sulguni cheese topped with a poached egg. Whisk it around (the waiter will show you) to create the delicious mishmash that makes this Georgian calzone one of the tastiest things on the menu. Of course, we also noshed on other tasty appetizers, starting with a basic tomato/cucumber/onion salad (one of my all time favorites); then a very good dish of marinated zucchini, eggplant, and peppers; and, finally, some obligatory khinkali (Georgian dumplings). We got the pork-beef variety but you can go for lamb, too. You'll get three oversize dumplings, the spiced meat encased by thick tee-pees of dough. OTG offers spices and flavors new and old. It's hard to think of a more authentic purveyor of Georgian food in the 5 boroughs, at least one that I've come across. There is much more menu to explore in Old Tbilisi, and I will be back as long as they stick around.

They stagger the ticket times, but it's all the same show, so I definitely think it makes sense to just book the earliest entrance time possible to spend the most time inside. The ticket says ""dress to impress the Queen"" so it was very cool just to see how dressed up my fellow New Yorkers were. Definitely a nice chance to pull out something formal or crazy or furry or sequined from your closet! The men were almost all wearing suits and ties.I think everyone's experience inside will be a little different... Immediately after going inside, I got pulled aside by an actor to a tiny room where he gave me a palm reading and a little sparkle sticker on my cheek... with a note to deliver to the bartender (which, in retrospect, I should have read but didn't!). My boyfriend got pulled aside too and kissed on the neck and had his hand drawn on (comes into play later in the show) by some woman.There are lots of drinks ready at the bar. I picked up a pink champagne / vodka / honey drink that was delicious. There are some hors d'oeuvres going around too if you're hungry... had an amazing deviled egg and mini foie gras donut. There are various acrobatic acts going on in the center of the room before the real show starts. There's not as much to explore as Sleep No More, but we did wander behind the stage into an entirely wax room with a topless woman in a bathtub...They kind of randomly grab people and seat them once dinner time starts although there's clearly some reserved seating for those who have the more expensive tickets. The show consisted of either dancing or acrobatic acts that come together into a vague story about the Queen's daughter's initiation. Actors will come around and dance around you or whisper to you or touch you during the show too, so there's definitely more going on than just on the stage. At one point, I got hoisted into the air to assist in the Chinese yo-yo act...Food was delicious. Our table had the cage of lobsters. They were probably the most enormous and tasty lobsters I've ever had. A little messy to eat in your nice clothes, but they do provide bibs, lobster crackers and forks, and wet napkins. We also tried some of the paella (which is what vegetarians get) and suckling pig from nearby tables. My favorite part was the end where everyone gets up to slow dance (so it's a really nice date idea to go as a couple!) and then got fed bites of awesome dessert.",18,0.9975

I'm no boba/bubble tea connoisseur, but I've had my fair share of boba in this city. I judge my boba based on how good the black milk tea is and the consistency of the boba. It needs to have the right texture and chewiness without being mushy. Of all the boba tea spots in NYC, I have to say Kung Fu Tea is the best for NYC. This new location is much bigger and definitely much more comfortable than the last location on 10th street. This location has indoor and outdoor seating and the best part is.. They're open late! I can finally satisfy that midnight craving because this location is open til 1am!!!! :)Just as the other locations, you can control your sugar level and ice level to your liking.Some of my favorites at Kung Fu Tea are; black milk tea, green milk tea and the grapefruit green tea.

This is not some random wings place in a sports bar, the owner/ head chef is actually from the Culinary Institute of America and he makes all the sauces himself.In addition to the usual BBQ sauce for your wings, this place has exotic flavors such as Spicy Thai with Basil or even Vietnamese Chili Mango. My favorite sauce was the Mexy Q. Imagine a delicious, rich, BBQ sauce with a nice Mexican Chile kick to it. I also enjoyed the Garlic Parmesan Beurre Banc, which balanced out the Mexy Q because it was lighter. You can opt for boneless wings or wings with the bone. If you don't eat meat, fret not, they have vegan nuggets and turkey wignettes. Now let's talk about french fries. You can't have wings without fries. What makes the fries so special here, is once again, the different flavors! I had both the normal fries and sweet potato fries (yes, I know all of you out there love sweet potato fries). You must try the Indian Masala fries, which were delicious. Where else are you gonna get Masala fries? We also had the pepper Parmesan fries and Southwestern. Make sure you get some dipping sauces, they taste even better when dipped in ketchup or chipotle mayo. A lot of people ordered take out from here but if you decide to sit in here and eat, let me tell you, the service was amazing.

A line usually forms at about 5:30pm ish, but if you get here before 6, you're almost guaranteed one of their 32 seats when they open. Anyone not within the first wave of guests will usually have to wait about 30 minutes.As for the pancakes, the serving size is big, with 3 pancakes and you can easily get full just off 2 alone! If you come here with a guest, it's best that one of you get the pancakes and the other get some other item so that you can share. Usually many guests will split the pancakes and also split an order of Chicken & Waffles, which is also INCREDIBLE! Clinton St. Bakery's fried chicken is some of the best I've ever had. The skin is super crunchy and the meat is very moist. You can see the moisture on the meat the second you peel the skin right off of them. The meal comes with 4 pieces of chicken, so be assured you will be stuffed from all that chicken plus a giant waffle!Now back to the pancakes. They are amazingly soft and fluffy with the topping usually covering about half of the top pancake. Included with every order is a small cup of warm maple butter. If you thought the pancakes couldn't get any better, the warm maple butter (YES it's as good as it sounds) add another layer of richness to it. When you slice off a piece of the pancakes and dip it in that warm goodness, the pancake melts in your mouth. It's very addictive and that might be an understatement.Out of the pancakes I've tried so far, I'll have to say the Crunchy Banana might be my favorite. It's got a beautiful balance of sweet and sugary flavors with the banana and cinnamon-chocolate sauce. The warmness of the sauce is such a good compliment to the pancakes. I feel there's a really good balanced flavor for this pancake because no one flavor dominates the pancakes and you get a good taste of the banana as well as the chocolate syrup.I can't say enough good things about their pancakes and if you don't believe a word I say, give them a visit. The pancakes really do speak for themselves as real words can't do those fluffy saucers justice!----------------------- UPDATE -----------------------I came here recently for the 1st time since their expansion and what can I add that I already haven't said about this pancake haven? YES, their pancakes are STILL the best as I recently tried their Japanese Pumpkin pancakes, which were absolutely as delicious as EVER. The pancakes not only had pieces of pumpkin on top, but they also had filling inside! As always, the pancakes were fantastic and still the best I've ever had (yes, I've been to Cafe Luluc).However, this updated review is not to shower more praise on their pancakes, but I wanted to touch on the awesome expanded restaurant they opened up on the corner of Clinton and Houston Streets. The expansion of the restaurant was a brilliant idea! There are now about 20+ more seats than the original restaurant, which is awesome! It just feels like there is so much more space, almost double, than the original location. The original location is still operating, but I heard that it only opens on weekends. The tables in the new location are not on top of each other and there is plenty of walking space. In addition, it's very clean and simple and looks like it can accommodate parties of all sizes with the amount of booth space they have. I'm glad to see they didn't try to squeeze in every possible table and seat allowed inside.I'm not sure when they made this change, but they now open at 5pm for dinner so for those who can get out of work and head straight there it's perfect! You don't have to wait outside in the freezing cold, specifically during Pancake Month. We arrived around 5:30pm on a Thursday and there were only a few people inside. Unlike the old location, the restaurant didn't fill to capacity until around 7ish and even then the table turnover was quick. The service in the new location was excellent still. The dining area area was dimly-lit and the kitchen is actually exposed so you can see the cooks at work. In addition, I love the new bar area as you enter the restaurant. It has about 9 seats and is perfect for single diners or people who prefer to sit at the bar.Same ol' pancakes and service, but a better home now!",13,0.9996
920,10,7,5.0,"I absolutely love this place! It is the epidemy of an English gastropubs, without all that English plague. Vibrant food, mulled wine; The Spotted Pig is buzzing each night and you are bound to run into someone here. With that in mind, prepare in endure long waits and cramped seating. Definitely a place for some mean eats. Don't be confused with the menu here, just know that this establishment belongs to that British subgenre called the ""gastro-pub,"" a bar serving simple, straightforward food. However, straightforward at The Spotted Pig means traditional English food transcending into an Italian twist. And for those of you who rather prefer to drink your dinner, their 100 bottle wine list and casks of beer will warm your soul. Also a great for brunch with the standard West Village brunch prices. But where else can you get Gingerbread Pancakes with a light vanilla cream, candied almonds, and a blizzard of powdered sugar? Or their Deep Fried Poached Eggs with Chorizo Stew? Did I mention their Fried Duck Egg with Ramps and Anchovy Dressing? Or their Two Poached Eggs with Roast Pork Hash? Damn, I'm hungry again!",13,0.9545
921,9,10,5.0,"Piora was simply amazing and I had a wonderful time at this cozy restaurant in West Village with my friends. The restaurant newly opened under the command of Simon Kim, the restaurateur and Chris Cipollone, an amazing chef. Our experiences here could not have been better. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating providing an impeccable service, the bartenders were amazing (gotta try the Sake Nog!), and the food was fantastic. No wonder why Piora received so much publicity and was raved on magazines, restaurant reviews, and newspapers by so many! The ambience was just perfect for a small party, not too loud, but intimate enough to really have a nice meal with friends. With the beautiful lighting in the back of the restaurant, I would highly recommend this place to couples as well. For those who want a meal under a more casual setting, please feel free to sit at the bar to enjoy your meal with a friend or even by yourself. In any way, this small restaurant can fit all! Our meal started with the complementary starter potato truffle soup, which was tasty and followed by Monkey Bread, Sweet Potato, Barbeque Octopus, and Carrots. My favorite was the carrot, which was so unexpected. The yogurt sauce blended well with the carrot and created perfect harmony. It was certainly a new taste, simple and elegant. Barbeque Octopus was also amazing with an interesting twist. I definitely sensed the Korean element in this dish, which was done in a contemporary approach. The texture of the octopus was great, sauce blended well, and wonderfully presented. Sweet Potato, which is common in Korea, was perfect, just the way it should be and it brought out the nostalgic feeling in me. Monkey Bread with seaweed and rosemary lardo butter really kicked the door open for our demanding appetites.Our main dishes were Bucatini and Rohan duck, which were both out of this world. Bucatini with dungeness crab, black garlic and chili added a light scent of spiciness to the dish, while elevating the beautiful mixture of garlic and crab taste into a perfected crafted pasta. Rohan duck was quite possibly the best duck dish I've had in New York. The jujube sauce and the tangy flavor created harmony with the richness of the duck. It was just perfect. We finished our dinner with a Mango sorbet w/ cotton candy that was not only beautiful in presentation, but also heavenly in taste. Mango pieces chopped with mango sorbet, basil sauce, creme, and small meringue pieces was delightfully light and refreshing. I am looking forward to come back here to try out other dishes as well. My dining experience here was amazing and I can't wait to see the new menus that will be rolling out as the year goes. Also, Shinya Yamao is also a key attribute to this wonderful place as his charismatic presence parallels his skills for the most wondrous drinks. If you are not looking for a meal, feel free to swing by and sit at the bar for drinks. You will be pleasantly surprised. Thank you Piora!",9,0.9997
922,14,11,5.0,"Yay! We have been walking past this place for a while, eagerly awaiting its opening. So exciting to have some healthy food on our block! (Instead of Chipotle, have a collard wrap?)We decided to stop in to check it out, since we had never been to any of the other locations. Zack was really friendly in greeting us, and gave us a grand tour of all of the offerings. He was hilarious and honest about how he usually survives on fast food, and had no idea that healthy food could taste so good. He joked that he is often taking ""shots"" at work, referring to the booster juice shots they sell. We theorized that it would be a great idea to have a shot happy hour. They have hot soups for $5, pressed juices, daily cleanse options, salads, wraps, various meal replacement ""mylks,"" and yes, desserts! All vegan! The chocolate mousse (made of avocado base) is delicious. I was in lactose-intolerant heaven! The immaculate display of juices and vegan meals also articulated the benefit of each item (e.g., +energy, meal replacement, immunity, etc), which is definitely helpful if you're not sure about what you're looking for. They also offered delicious samples of smoothies to help us make our choices. Definitely a convenient grab-and-go place. It's not cheap, but the salad and wraps look like good portions, and you know exactly what you are putting into your body. As the big wooden plaque says above the display: ""Take care of your body.

923,8,4,5.0,"I am pretty much am all about brunching in Tribeca on the weekends. I mean I'm kind of lazy and there are just so many amazing choices to choose from just down the street from where I live! Locanda Verde is a must for this weekend favorite meal. My bestie and her bf have been here before and they always wanted me to try brunch here. Finally, just this past Saturday, we were able to secure a coveted reservation and headed over after a late night on the town just a few hours earlier. The inside is simply beautiful. Jon and I totally fell in love with the decor here. Mirrors that reflect the natural light from the outside, cool lamps, and an awesome bar that was lit up on each shelf- AWESOME! There was also a really cool chalk board with the pastries and specials near the cafe area. Now onto the food... some of the portions could have been a little larger, but I have to admit, everything was super delicious. For the table, we started with the Sheep's Milk Ricotta with truffle honey and burnt orange toast- this was so amazing and was definitely a great way to start the meal. Kelly's been here before so she opted for trying something different from her previous visits, the 8 Hour Tripe and fried eggs. Jon is a pancake kinda guy so he had the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes with blueberries and meyer lemon curd. I'm not huge on pancakes but I can agree that this was simply heavenly. The Lemon citrus sauce really gave it the extra pow. Lastly, Kelly suggested I try the Uovo Modenese with cotechino hash, spinach and tomato hollandaise. Not only was this so pretty to look at on the plate, it was one of the best brunch dishes I've ever had. I love eggs and it had the perfect tomato and veggies amount to balance out the sausage. Although the bill add up quite easily here, if you are looking for an impressive brunch with amazing food and good service, I suggest you quickly make a reservation and enjoy the best weekend meal here.",12,0.9988
924,14,9,5.0,"Diners beware, you will leave here in a full on meat coma. I don't know how I stumbled upon The Cannibal - I think I typed in ""dinner outside"" in Flatiron and voila, it came up in my search and I am so glad that it did. I met up with one of my best friends for dinner here last night and we feasted. I arrived first and sat at the bar. They have a very extensive beer list and quite a few wines to choose from. I let the bartender choose for me because I found him entertaining (especially when he asked the other bartender if he peed when there was a wet spot on the floor). Once my friend arrived he ordered a beer and we sat outside. The seating is semi-communal and since we were a party of two we shared a table with four guys, no big deal. We wanted to maximize our meat sampling, so we decided to order a few smaller items instead of going with the apparently infamous half a pig's head (which I will be trying next time when we come back with more people). We started off with the ham plate, which was basically three different kinds of piggy! It was divine. I love ham. Next came the bone marrow, which kind of grossed me out because that is the part of the meat I avoid, but I did dip some bread in the juices after my friend ate all of the marrow and then finally came our delicious jalapeno sausage. Ummm... yum. This was the best sausage I have had in my entire existence. So good and I can't wait to try the other kinds. We also threw in some broccoli rabe for good measure, but it's not really worth mentioning because it is not meat and who cares. It was a vegetable and it tasted fine. The vibe here is very laid back and not like most places you find in the area considering Flatiron is basically full of pretentious people and wannabes trying to be cool. I would 1,000% come back here and would recommend to anyone who loves MEAT!I gained 2lbs today, but it was worth it.",12,0.9942

926,14,7,5.0,"Prosperity Dumpling is about as good as it gets for cheap food in NYC. Usually you get cheap, or you get good, or some pseudo mixture of the two, but rarely does a place provide the best for the least.My standard order is 2 orders of fried dumplings (4 + 4), plus a sesame pancake. This is exactly $3. These fried pork+chive dumplings are just like my family makes from scratch in China -- very authentic. Not too greasy, perfectly fried and the right size. The sesame pancake is light and crisp on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside. You can even spend a few pennies more and get it stuffed with some meats and veggies.  There is always a line out the door, but don't fret as they are very quick. The constant and predictable hoards of hungry patrons ensure constant and predictable cooking of dumplings. It's just like how Two Bros always has pizza right out of the oven because they always have customers.If you follow my reviews, you know I am a nut for good value, and Prosperity Dumpling is the leader of the pack when it comes to bang-for-the-buck.

But instead I can tell you that you can find me here, and surprisingly often, and all of this even while I am still very much alive. Shocking? Yes. In New York we all seek sanctuary in places that shield us from the chaos and manic energy and noises that we call home. These places are called 'bars'. But sometimes you need a little more! Like, an actual sanctuary. I make a habit of parking myself in a pew during any given non-Sunday, usually for no more than thirty minutes at a time. When I leave, I feel refreshed. Not for any religious reason, but because I was able to think clearly without my brainwaves being intercepted ten billion times by anything and everything whirling around. It's a huge beautiful space, quiet, clean, free, and almost always empty.

928,11,10,5.0,"Montmartre is fantastic! I came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday night looking to satisfy a French food craving - and Montmartre definitely delivered. We had a reservation for 8pm and when we arrived, we were promptly seated and excited for a delicious meal.We were pretty hungry, so we went for three appetizers: the French Onion Gratinee, the Steak Tartare and the Sunchokes. I love Steak Tartare, so I had to order it even though we really came to try the other two dishes. It ended up being the perfect amount of steak - not too little that would make me crave more and not the sometimes over the top amount that other places serve. The dish can sometimes end up being a little much, but Montmartre's was right on point: it satisfied my craving and I still had plenty of room for the other two appetizers. The French Onion Gratinee was awesome, I had never had a french onion soup with oxtail in it, the pairing was phenomenal. The oxtail was cooked perfectly: very, very tender (and don't worry, no bones to worry about!) and the flavor paired perfectly with the rich onion and the melted cheese. This is definitely worth giving a try. Finally, the Sunchokes were amazing! They had so much flavor and was a great vegetable pairing to go with our other appetizers. The flavor of the vegetable came through the glaze to make what was definitely a refreshing dish and a great preparation for our main courses.For our entrees, we chose the Arctic Char Salad and the Brandade Tartine. The Arctic Char Salad was much more impressive than we were expecting. It was a multifaceted meal that paired arctic char with mustard greens and also acorn squash with wild rice. The arctic char and the mustard greens sit on top - the pieces of cod were cooked a little more than seared, but not quite rare. This gave the fish a firmer texture for the salad while still maintaining all of its flavor. After working your way through the arctic char and mustard greens, you're still in for a treat: the acorn squash is delicious when paired with the wild rice. On a dish that I was already totally satisfied with, this extra feature really put it over the top for us. Not to be out done, the Brandade Tartine was amazing. Here's how the dish was set up: the brandade was spread thick on a piece of toast and topped with a heap of ham, roasted red peppers and olives. When I was considering ordering the dish, I was a little worried that the brandade might be a little too salty for me, but it wasn't - at all. The light, seafood flavor of the brandade paired perfectly with the ham and each piece of red pepper came through with each bite. I wish I could eat a sandwich like this for lunch every day! Aside from the great food (which was already a huge win), the service at this restaurant was impeccable. Each time either of us had gotten up, someone had folded our napkin for us. Whenever any member of the wait staff (not just our waiter) walked by, they would make sure our water was topped off and cleaned up all plates we weren't using. Since the restaurant is on the smaller side, this kind of service made sure your table wasn't overly cluttered with plates, we still had plenty of room to move around, even when we had three appetizers on the table simultaneously. I highly recommend checking out Montmartre, it was an amazing experience that I can't wait to have again.",9,0.9993

The bread that comes with it is rustic, toasted, and drizzled with olive oil, yumminess of crunchiness. I had the prosciutto, parmesan, steamed eggs with toasts, it was very good.

She was very patient about my questions and really did a great job of explaining how to build an attractive bracelet. After checking out a bunch of samples, I was able to purchase a set that made my lady happy when I gave it to her.While I was in the store, I had a chance to check out their other merchandise. They had a nice selection and it was good to see that they offered attractive jewelry at reasonable prices (with the Pandora items being the same as the list prices on the company's website). What really is good about this store is how friendly and accommodating the folks are. I wasn't sure if the length of the bracelet I purchased was appropriate and Robin told me to come back if the size was too big. Two hours later we came back to exchange it for a smaller size, no questions asked (I also ended up buying two more charms, simply because I was impressed with their service).In the future, we will definitely back for our upcoming Pandora or other purchases at this store.

It reminds me of what is known as a ""Low Country Boil"" or ""Beaufort Stew"" back in South Carolina.(Note: I've only had the boiled shrimp, crawfish, and king crab legs)TIP:Do yourself a favor and get the House Special Seasoning, preferably with at least medium spice. The House Special is strong and bold, enhancing the taste of the seafood just enough while steering clear of being abrasive. Perfecto!SIDE NOTE:You may be urged to take the remaining season left in your bag home with you to sop up with a biscuit or something. Try your best to resist this temptation.ANOTHER TIP:The wait for this place is ridiculous on a regular basis. You can either get their early, say about 5 to eat immediately with your party. Or you can arrive, make a reservation in person for a specific time, and then go back. Of course the later you wait, the less flexibility and perhaps the longer the required wait. Fortunately I can quickly get back to my place quite quickly via CitiBike so reservations aren't terrible. DISCLAIMER: These are only guidelines and not a guarantee. I've noticed weeknights and inclement weather can shorten wait times.WARNINGS:The combos, or 2 pounds or more of an item come with A corn and A potato. I over looked this in my liberated state the first time with expectations of how we prepare this dish back home. All of the seafood is joined in the boil with abundant pieces of potatoes, corn, and sausage.TIP x3:Be prepared to leave smelling like some good @$$ seafood. Things will get messy and juices maybe flying. You can dress accordingly to your liking with that info.TIP IV:You might want to double up on the rubber gloves. The sauce seeps through. What's more, a lemon, or other strong citrus fruit goes a long way to cutting the seafood garlic smell on your hands. The Boil does give you little wet wipes thought to clean your hands after your indulgence.HEADS UP:Only cash is accepted. There is however an ATM at the front of the store. One option is to visit the ATM of your local bank while waiting.SUGGESTION:If you're not sure how to eat crawfish ask your waiter/waitress. They will be happy to demonstrate the procedure for you.

937,21,11,5.0,"Note: This is a review for ""The Office"" escape game. It's a rarity when my high expectations are met or exceeded, and Escape the Room (NYC!) was definitely one of those rare occasions! Reserve a ticket on Eventbrite (Friday through Sunday times only). Each time slot will hold up to 10 people. Once there, you'll take an elevator to the 15th floor of an office building and wait for all members of your group to arrive. You'll be trapped inside of a seemingly normal-looking office room. However, there are hidden objects to be discovered and codes, locks, and puzzles that need to be solved using the creative brain power of the people in your group. You'll have an hour to find the key that unlocks the main office door to make an escape. You'll also be given two cards that your group can turn in for two clues (clues of the game master's choosing) at any two points within the hour. Since the room is currently being shared with a graphic designer, there is a small section of the room that isn't part of the game where you will put your coats and bags. In addition, the game master will actually be in the room with you and give you the time remaining while also silently noting the genius and not-so-genius parts of your escape plan! The clues were VERY challenging, and it was such a thrill to work together. My competitive spirit was definitely released. Every time we made progress, we all clapped and yay'd in unison. My group was unfortunately (frustratingly, disappointingly!) not able to escape though we were pretty close. I do think, as Brian R. mentioned, that 10 people may be a bit much.

938,18,23,5.0,"Is 'Sun Vin Grocery' indeed an anagram of 'nervous crying'? Well, one cold winter day, I was almost in tears after being unable to locate my favorite Ginger Milk tea at some of the hole-in-the-wall grocery stores on Mott Street. Only to find it within minutes in one of the many fluorescent-lit, relatively spacious aisles of Sun Vin, just a short walk away on Mulberry.Grocery shopping is an unpleasant chore. But Sun Vin makes up for the mundane nature of the pursuit with its colorful assortment of fruit drinks, Pocky sticks, teas, candy and gummy snacks drawn from China, Indonesia, Thailand and parts of the world where the purchasing power of the dollar is still not deserving of mockery. I even found those tea cups that I bought at the French Concession and Tianzifang in Shanghai--they are fully 20% cheaper at Sun Vin!The checkout experience is no-nonsense and quick even if not friendly. Interestingly, every item in the receipt simply reads 'Grocery'--so much for SKU data and UPC codes. Then again, I quite like the abstraction, especially when what is concealed in the line items is my shameless love for cloying candy and sugary snacks.We have a winner in Sun Vin. I shall be back soon!",26,0.7671

Her name is Effie, she always makes me look smexy and fresh, and ofc they charge an affordable price!Anyways... so about this new shop, just gonna make it quick and sweet:- Relatively small but its good-sized. Fits about 5-6 people at once.- Very modern interior with a bright and metallic theme.- The staffs here are all blazed up and pressed up in black and white. Very trendy looking.- Felt like I was sitting in a lounge at one point because of the music in the background (it was Disclosure's song)- Look for Effie, she's off on Thursdays only. Some other people mentioned Roy in their reviews, I've not tried him before, he looks like a nice dude.- 20% discount right now as it is a new shop.Get your hair cut today!!",27,0.9316
940,31,28,5.0,"It's now quite obvious that I might never have to leave the proximity of where I live for a downtown experience as long as wonderful spots like DTUT have opened in the UES/Yorkville part of town. Why schlep down to 14th street or Brooklyn when places like this rivals or even betters anything they have to offer? This coffee house and cocktail joint rocks! A terrific addition to the neighborhood indeed.Where else would I go to experience a great selection of coffee drinks, snacks, wines, beer, and cocktails all in one place? Right around the block from my crib. Heck, they even serve up coffee cocktails if looking for both a buzz and caffeine rush at the same time. It's not just a coffee shop but a liquor bar too! Oh, bring some friends to play board games they have on hand here. Read one of the books they have on the shelf for all to enjoy. Use the free wifi they offer Monday to Friday if you need to get some work done or just surf the net. Weekends are made for conversing and socializing so it's a great concept keeping wifi off on Sat and Sun. Drink and have fun! Talk to each other! Don't forget to satify that sweet tooth as they offer two different sizes of ""make it yourself"" smores and fondues. Bring a group or just come on a date as DTUT has something for everyone. As their name stands for Downtown Uptown they have really perfected the downtown vibe right up here on the upper part of Manhattan. With most of the old school coffee houses that many of us grew up with disappearing it is totally refreshing to have a real coffee house in the area now that is not associated with any chains. Such a chill inviting vibe here. Friendly staff and owner. Exposed brick walls. An eclectic mix of carefully arranged shabby chic furniture, comfy old couches, big plush chairs, tables, stools, ottomans, pillows and cushions. Retro Edison style lighing and mirrors along with cool artwork adorn the walls. Some great music from indie rock to country to old school jams to etheral tunes are on constant play. Loyalty card too to collect a free drink. On those nice days the front opens up with an old wooden window seating counter to kick back at and watch the world walk by. Cozy and relaxing environment.Dare I say it that the UES/Yorkville part of town has a bit of hipster cool up here now? Just come and enjoy what DTUT has to offer, grab a drink, and ride the caffeine wave.",36,0.9986

I love spots with great craft beer so naturally it is my go-to spot when in the area. Spitzer's has two bars- main one and another one in the back room. It's can get a little crowded and it's sometimes hard to find a spot to sit. If you'd like a table you might have to make a reservation of some sort.  Great place to come with a small group though since seating may be a little tightBathrooms are located downstairs, which is nice because they are away from both bars and all seating.

943,26,22,5.0,"In a city where every establishment vies to be the best and everyone is jaded towards anything less than extraordinary, rarely do I find myself truly surprised anymore. My entire experience at Employees Only surpassed everything I expected and more.First off, the bouncer (excuse me, doorman) that evening was one of the friendliest guys working a door I've ever encountered. He needs to be cloned and have his clones distributed throughout Meatpacking District to replace all of the other bouncers and doormen.... for reals.Getting inside only took about 10 minutes on an obviously busy Saturday night and the whole time we were chatting it up with this man. Once inside, the palpable energy was uplifting and all consuming. Talk about an upper! As my eyes darted around the dimly lit interior, I fell in love immediately with the modern art deco feel which I took as a small homage to Prohibition times. True, this bar is not a legit speakeasy but you would probably walk on by if you didn't know any better. There is no sign saying ""Employees Only,"" just its symbol in the shape of a key on the awning plus a neon lit sign in the window saying ""Psychic."" You can usually just spot it by the line outside on an otherwise quiet block.The bar area was unsurprisingly packed. I noticed a small dining room area in the back for those who wished to avoid the livelier scene up front. Hey I'm sure it's more intimate but screw that! Like a highly renowned sushi restaurant, the bar is the place to be. You should want to be up close to smell the action. Watching the bartenders work their magic (and their hard biceps) is the new female aphrodisiac. Move over, oysters!Now I'm not going to lie, trying to get a seat at the bar can be a little bit of a game and dance but the amazing principal bartender signaled to me when a couple was about to leave. I then hovered like a pretty vulture to get the highly coveted seats staring down anyone eying my spot. Don't play the musical chairs game with me because I will win. As Sheldon would say, this is MY spot.For drinks I started off with the Billionaire Cocktail, because let's face it, I'm a balla. This yummy concoction was made with Baker's Bourbon shaken with lemon Juice, EO grenadine & absinthe bitters. My next beverage, which was bartender's choice, had a dash of black pepper on it. Can't remember the name of it but I know bourbon was used. My companions also had a few drinks of their own and thoroughly enjoyed them as well. I might have had a third cocktail but nothing ingested that night was less than delicious. This statement does not only cover the beverages but also the food as well!With great drink comes great responsibility to eat lest you become a mess. I had to have the Bone Marrow Poppers which in a nutshell are flaky little pastries topped off with dollops of fatty bone marrow goodness. So delectable. We also ordered the Braised Octopus with roasted fennel, celery & green olives. Delicious, tender octopus with the perfect flavor. I feel like most places don't get octopus right but EO thoroughly nailed it with Thor's Hammer.Since I'm always craving raw meat, I knew I had to try the Hand-Cut Steak Tartar. Now ladies, we all know when we've had something good and we HAVE to have it again... The steak tartar was no exception. I got it. Twice. Let me see if I can describe this act of culinary foreplay. Bartender brings forth a bowl of diced filet mignon which is so red and juicy looking. Next, he starts pointing out to me various ingredients that will go into the bowl. I'm thinking oh great, I get to mix my own tartar! Nope, wrong. The man mixing my freaking awesome cocktails is also mixing my raw meat in front of me! I think I'm in love. Verdict? It is honestly one of the best tartars I have ever had. No joke.I cannot rave enough about the quality of the bartenders here. Not only does it seem like they are personally attending to you amongst a crowded bar but their obvious dedication and love of their craft is so wonderful to watch. By now it's obvious that I will be coming back for more libations, scintillating conversation (what is it about speakeasies that makes me want to talk about sensual subjects?) and mouthwatering dishes. I have found a new bar obsession and it's mine... Don't bother me.------------------------------------------------Side notes:1. Yes they do have a ""psychic"" there on weekends! For a great deal of $25, Madame whats-her-face will read your palm fortune. I will not discuss the enlightening predictions she bestowed upon me *insert sarcasm here* but let me warn you now that it took a week to scour those damn purple marks off my hand.2. I've heard through the grapevine that the reason it's named Employees Only is because back in the day, it would only admit people who actually worked in bars in NYC... So in essence this place used to open its doors to only other bartenders and bar owners. HENCE THE NAME, ""Employees Only""",27,0.999

It's so easy to feel uncomfortable in these kinds of stores, and maybe even a little embarrassed, but like the other reviewers I can honestly say that I've never felt more comfortable & generally welcomed in an adult store before. The mom & son duo who run it are very professional, friendly and caring. Mom, who runs the lingerie section, is knowledgeable about her products and will help you find the right size in anything. What I love most about this place aside from the experience are the prices. I really doubt that you can find better deals anywhere else in the city. I've had a few conversations with the son and he always tells me that Yelp has been a Godsend for their business, so I knew I had to add to the already stellar record in hopes of drawing even more customers.

945,3,3,5.0,"I've tried acupuncture all over the city and while I've experienced some positive effects I have never felt transformed afterwards. In my experience it usually involves speaking to a practitioner for five minutes, being poked with needles and left alone for fifteen minutes then being sent on my way. All that changed after I started seeing Finbar. I'm an athlete and a dancer so I run into bodily injuries here and there. This past spring my back was in bad shape and went into spasm. I could barely walk without pain and definitely couldn't arch at all. I had a competition approaching and needed to recover in time for it. He worked on me by using massage techniques, acupuncture and recommendations for herbs and other natural remedies. I started improving within days and slowly regained enough range of motion to compete and take 2nd place!I've seen him for many other ailments as well. He is unique in that he listens, genuinely cares for your well being and offers affordable rates for detail-oriented service. I'm not saying that people should replace traditional medicine with only natural therapies to heal. I believe in a combination of Western and Eastern medicine.

I opted to go with the stewed chicken and stewed beef. It was served with white rice, a stewed spinach, some kind of peanut based sauce and a sweet root vegetable. It had the consistency of cassava, but it was sweet. The food was mildly spicy and delicious! Loved it. Going back or the lamb stew.",8,0.9751

It was everything I dreamed of and more. These guys created a pretty freakin cool place for anyone who wants to find real clean food on the go (even if you don't follow a paleo diet).There are about 4 different counters to order from including a coffee bar, mash bar, hot counter, and prepared foods section.The coffee bar had all different organic coffee offerings. On their milk bar they even have homemade almond milk and coconut sugar. Next you have what they call their ""Mash Bar"" which I didn't spend too much time at. It looked like they had some pretty awesome fresh juices, smoothies, and different types of concoctions with ingredients like grain-free granola, chia pudding, almond butters, etc.We headed to the back where the hot breakfast section was. I ordered a bowl where you can choose quinoa or root vegetable mash as the base. I got the vegetable mash topped with veggie medley and an over easy egg. My boyfriend got the primal french toast that was drizzled with cashew cream and syrup with blueberries. It was ah-mazing! We also got some of their grass-fed bacon on the side.On top of all of this there is a prepared foods section. From there we got some grass fed meatballs to take home. I also bought some grain free raw granola that has made for a yummy breakfast this week. AND to top it off we had to try a paleo treat.

The staff is pretty nice, and I have a large amount of respect for people willing to move gracefully around us dancers and still be friendly to us.

Their prices are insanely good on some items (greek yogurt for example). The selection is really incredible considering how small the actual store is.

Our table was a repurposed antique sewing machine! The pedals were right by our feet, so adorbs.Some people in our party were late, but no one at Feast made a fuss or seemed to care even though they were busy. The brunch comes with a drink, entree, & an array of apps. We were given a bread basket, yogurt parfait, carrot juice shots, potato tart. Besides being beautifully presented, it was super fun for all of us to have little tastes of everything. It's a really great way to start off your brunch!All of the entrees are just the right size without making you fall over with the itis. The whole brunch experience was filling but at the same time, light enough for you to walk away to enjoy the rest of your careful Sunday afternoon. My smoked salmon was so delicately prepared with pieces of trout & poached quail eggs. I thought it was delicious but I don't think i would order it again but quite frankly, I can get smoked salmon at a lot of places.

It was 6 fish courses and then 2 dessert courses. Each fish course was different, with a very different sauce, and a different white wine. This is the tasting menu to do if you are a seafood lover. If you live for red meat and wine then you may be disappointed. I am a dessert person and I always leave expensive tasting menus disappointed in the dessert course.

So the menu is not for the faint of heart (literally). They serve all kinda of animal body parts soaked in the most delicious sauces, and grilled to perfection. For example, the fois gras with chocolate sauce? Booyah. Short beef ribs buns w/ scallions and love, topped w/ this spicy mayo. Daddy. And of course, the most juicy slab of prime beef bbq'ed in front of you (the waitress cooked it because we were lazy and she did one heck of a job).

964,16,18,5.0,"OH. MERCY. I love me some fine dining. I really do. I am such a sucker for the service and the pulling out of chairs, and the way the champagne bottle is wrapped in a cloth napkin. Everything is just so...fancy.I would give Asiate 3,000 stars if I could. Make that an option. I went for my anniversary this past Saturday night. I was married at the Mandarin Oriental exactly one year ago, so it was fitting that we return for our first anniversary dinner. We arrived about 10 minutes early and were seated anyway. As we walked in, I loved the modern feel, the clean lines, the massive double height floor to ceiling windows that made the city your decor (which is basically why we decided to get married there). We were escorted to what I would call the best table in the house. It was in the front, in the corner, so both seats had dead-on gorgeous, breathtaking views of Columbus Circle and 59th street. Snow covered Central Park was so pretty, and even the glowing red lights of the CNN sign are so iconic to New York. Immediately our server came over with Prosecco. Turns out, my mom had sent it as an anniversary present. It was poured perfectly and we were off to the races with our menus. Even the bread was ridiculous. I chose the olive bread loved it. Crispy and had a faint enough olive taste to not be overwhelming. Oh goodie, that means the best is yet to come. We took our time with the menus and I decided on the winter truffle risotto with the extra black truffle supplement, because I was feeling all sorts of fancy. I also ordered the duck breast for an entree. I almost never order duck, but I figured if anyone would do it right, Asiate would. Before our appetizers came, the catering manager, James Munz from the ballroom one flight up came by to say hello to us. We had asked for him when we checked into our reservation. He told us that one year ago, our altar was positioned exactly above this table. My husband rolled his eyes as his heart is clearly made of cold hard stone, but I literally melted right into my ivory upholstered chair. Don't judge me. I hate PDA and almost never hold hands, but it was my ANNIVERSARY for the love of god. Come on, you all know you would have felt the same way. So now I am completely swooning and loving my husband more than ever at this moment (he can thank James later) and I have some more prosecco and our appetizers arrive. Listen you guys, you have the go for the black truffle risotto. You don't have to get anything else to eat. Just that. I grew up eating my mom's risotto and have a great affinity for it, but this was better. Apologies, Mama, but seriously thanks for the prosecco! This was the best most perfectly cooked aborio rice ever. And if you have ever attempted to cook risotto, my word it's challenging. But the chef at Asiate is some sort of risotto genius. It had a bunch of very large pieces of shaved black truffle on top, all lined up in a neat little row. My supplement! I had almost forgotten in the prior love-fest!You know how some dishes are just life-changing? I will never eat risotto the same way again. Nay, I probably won't eat it again. Ever. It won't be good anywhere else. I contemplated asking for more bread to sop up the remainder of the dish, but you know, I had my hair done for the occasion, so it was pretty special. I should act as lady like as possible. My entree arrived. I was a little bit concerned since I had ventured out on a limb for the duck breast, since I don't even really remember if it's something I like. Turns out, I LOVE DUCK BREAST. Oh wait, I mean I love ASIATE's duck breast. Mercy me, it was the god damn best cooked duck breast in the whole universe. The outside was crispy and delicate, the meat tender and flavorful, with miniature brussel sprouts all roasted on the plate and a sauce (a red wine reduction maybe? It might have even been a hoison sauce glaze of some kind) and I just flat-lined right there. Why is the rest of my life worth living after a meal like this?!Dessert came, which we didn't order but I think it part of the prix-fixe meal. It was a sampler, with about six little options, like ice cream and chocolate cakes. I'm not really a dessert person, and I really liked the dishes, but nothing stayed with me like that duck and risotto. They also brought another dish, which was a flourless chocolate cake that was completely gorgeous and extremely delicious, with happy anniversary written in chocolate on the plate. Really nice touch. I want to apologize for such a long review, but really sorry I'm not sorry because there is just no way to convey the way the heavens parted and angels sang while I dined. It's worth noting the incredible friendly and accommodating staff. Very professional, not at all intrusive, but we never wanted for anything. If you splurge on one meal this year (or in the next five years) make it Asiate. It's totally, completely, utterly worth it.",21,0.9995
965,8,4,5.0,"I have made it a rule not to review restaurants where I am an invited guest. Today I am making an exception. Eleven Madison Park, at the southern end of the Original Madison Square Garden, is the perfect location for a New American but truly international dining establishment. This is truly one of the best restaurants in both New York, and the country! I have always said that it is about the food, but let me say it starts here with the atmosphere and service which is unmatched in NYC. I love the spacious tables and the old school space worthy of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt himself!This is a perfect restaurant for a romantic rendezvous or a marriage proposal.  The caviar appetizer was exquisite, and the warm salad with mushrooms, pine nut, and kale combined a wonderful presentation with a medley of fresh, rustic flavors. My main course of roasted beef with root vegetables and black truffle was truly memorable. It was perfectly seared retaining its flavor and cutting perfectly. The dessert was very flavorful and subtle: Tart Tatin with Hibiscus Caramel and Creme Fraiche Ice Cream worthy of Paris, France. Eleven Madison Park is truly a special place worthy of the Annals of Madison Square Garden! It was a perfect place for me to connect/reconnect with many other Double Hoyas! If you are looking for a classy but friendly location this is the place!",16,0.9984
966,9,9,5.0,"4.5 stars.Crispo is also one of those places that's deceptive. When you enter, it's a narrow bar & dining area. But keep walking. You'll notice a few tiny nooks with seating & tables, a corridor where they've fit in some tables, and then finally it opens up into this rustic wonderland where it's christmas all year round! The lighting, exposed brick and fireplace makes it one of my favourite spots to dine at during the winter.I must have eaten here at least a dozen times. It feels so comfortable to me, it's almost home, and that's probably why I haven't even reviewed it so far. I know I'm not making a dent in the # of reviews here, but I have to say this. Crispo always feels like one of the most underrated restaurants I have been to. I don't hear much about it, it's always easy to get a reservation, and here it is on Yelp, with 500 reviews.Whether your party is big or small, whether it is date night or an office party, Crispo will fit your bill. They have an array of appetizers; like the bone marrow to appease the ardent meat-lovers, while still having enough on the menu to cater to the discriminating vegheads. I love the caprese here, and their tomatoes seem juicy & tart even in the dead of winter. They also have a lovely brussel sprouts dish with almonds. Ilili and Alta set high bars with their brussel sprouts.. so this one probably comes third in the race. Among their pastas, they have a beautiful whole wheat spaghetti with raisins and cauliflowers (a winning combo) and their black truffle ravioli always makes me want to lick the plate clean (and sometimes I do, so sue me.)In the dessert department, the only one that has captivated my taste buds so far is the cheesecake. Being Italian, of course they use ricotta instead of creamcheese.. giving an amazing texture and the taste goes beautifully with strawberries.Because of its perennial availability on the reservation front.. Crispo tends to be my go to option on several occasions, and that I am so grateful for.",17,0.9974
967,30,55,5.0,"My girlfriend doesn't eat.Well, she eats. But she doesn't Eat. When I started courting her, I plied her with all sorts of meals in the hope she'd be won over. But from Recette to Yakitori Totto, nothing elicited much more than mild appreciation. When I finally got it through my head that the way to her heart did not pass through her stomach, I despaired. The one arena where I thought I knew how to impress, and this gorgeous girl who I'd been falling for since day #1? Just. Didn't. Care. In fact, she found my fixation on food a little crazy.Fine, a lotta crazy.We got through two years of shared meals that way. Nearly 100 separate times, my dining enjoyment outstripped hers by orders of magnitude. 100 times, my dream to see her pupils dilate from eating faded a little more. By the time we got to Fedora, it was almost dead.Two hours later, she was kissing me in the street.What kind of Jedi mind trick had Fedora pulled?! Cocktails helped, so well-balanced that we excused the overly whimsical names. Our server/bartender's sheer competence was disarming too, menus and glasses smoothly gliding in and out of our hands.The bar he tended was quasi-historic, kept mostly unchanged from the property's previous life as a watering hole gone to seed. Many preservationist bloggers had been outraged, seeing this as a token gesture; to them, remaking the space for hipster appeal smacked of co-opting the past. But what co-opting! The decor was like catnip to my girlfriend, admirer of all things low-lit, wood-floored, tin-ceilinged, B&W-picture-walled.We puzzled over the menu -- ""everything sounds good,"" she said -- until hearing the specials. I can't tell you if her pupils dilated, but mine sure did. We ordered two, salmon belly and beef tongue. I confess to looking daggers at her when she asked for her belly to be done medium, not medium-rare; she reassured me, ""It'll be OK.""""But, but... you eat sushi, so what's the dif...""""Shhh, it'll be alright, love,"" she said, patting me on the hand. I couldn't know that the word ""alright"" would not cross my mind again that night.The salmon belly: Maybe thinking of pork belly, we thought the portion would be the size of a deck of cards. What came, however, was more like four decks. The look on her face was somewhere between desire and terror. After all, this lady had once termed half a grilled cheese, a few fries, and a third of a dessert ""a huge lunch"". For once, I sympathized with the plight of the dainty eater.I was distracted by the arrival of my tongue, another slab of protein plus a small moat of gravy and a fence of wonderfully crisp sweet potato fries. I wanted to check whether I'd need a knife, so I slid my fork through the tongue.I slid my fork THROUGH the tongue.That is, it felt like I wasn't cutting anything, like the fork was just passing through a hologram. This tactile absence was so incongruous that my brain short-circuited. I looked up to my girlfriend, eager to share the discovery.Somehow she'd already eaten two decks' worth. She guiltily whispered: ""It's... so good."" Yes, this is what Fedora reduced my Harvard-educated companion to.Even in retrospect, it's hard to be more cogent. The belly was like... the burnt ends of the ocean. Fatty, pink sea candy, dissolving in the mouth like the body didn't want to bother waiting for it to hit the stomach. There was some citrus note and some herb, but the details were lost on me. Like subtly applied makeup, the real art was in making it seem like added accents weren't even there.The tongue was just as tender as the forking had implied. The deeply flavored gravy actually made me a little mad that they hadn't included a spoon, as I had to lap it up with the fork instead.After those mains, dessert might've slipped into an afterthought. But cheesecake panna cotta with passionfruit caught our attention anew, with the... Agh, you get the idea. I loved the damn food at Fedora. Let the cynics cite Gabe Stulman's mini-empire as sign of runaway gentrification. But acknowledge that, even after the crackling atmosphere, the classy service, the alcohol... what was on the plate spoke for itself. Great is great.Even my girlfriend, so resistant to foodstuff charm, had to admit that. The spring in her step on W 4th Street afterwards -- I'd never seen her find so much joy in being so full. The silver bullet I'd sought had been in the West Village all along. Once I'd imagined telling her, ""Who's crazy NOW?"", but now that the moment was here, I felt only loving warmth for her, and gratitude for the spot of enchantment that a perfect meal can conjure.So, yup, maybe this review is biased. Maybe it's influenced by the fact that, out of those many many meals we've shared, Fedora is one of only two that my girlfriend has ever brought up again later. (The other? John Brown Smokehouse. Hey, she may not Eat, but the girl's got taste.)Maybe you should find out for yourself.Probability of return within 1 year: 99%",35,0.9982
968,11,15,5.0,"Guys, my foodie dream has been realized. I have eaten at a celebrity chef restaurant where that same said celebrity chef actually made my food. And then I got to meet the celebrity chef. And proceeded to tip over a chair in excitement...THE STORY:Boy & girl are given an unused primetime 8 PM Saturday night reservation by a friend to Gato. What luck considering reservations aren't really available for at least a month.Girl has done extensive research and knows exactly what she wants to order (thanks Yelpers!). She proceeds to order the lamb pizza for an appetizer ($17) & the kale and wild mushroom paella as her main ($27).Boy really isn't a foodie, doesn't know who Bobby Flay is, and orders the porterhouse pork chop ($29) because it seems the most filling.Orders placed, the girl notices Bobby Flay, who is working the line in the kitchen and starts getting uber excited. ""Wow, he is ACTUALLY making our food! Can this be?!""Waiter arrives with the food. Cue girl frantically asking: ""Does he ever come out of the kitchen to meet diners??"" ""Well, it's a busy night, but he does sometimes make the rounds."" ""OMG, can you please tell me the second he leaves??""-----SIDEBAR------ Lamb pizza - heavenly!!! The crust was beautifully crispy and chewy, and the tomato jam ""sauce"" really made this dish stand out. I only wished there were more lamb sausage slices on there. Kale & wild mushroom paella - PERFECTLY executed with a beautiful socarrat that is dug up from the bottom of the pan and mixed in for you by the server. The crispy artichokes and over easy egg on top were great additions that accentuated the dish. Porterhouse pork chop - Boy who only eats to live and literally NEVER says he enjoyed his meal takes a bite of his porterhouse pork and proceeds to exclaim that the dish is better than his beloved Peter Luger steak. I couldn't believe my ears. Yes folks, that's how you know how good the food here is. -----END SIDEBAR-----Distracted by the delicious food, girl temporarily stops fangirling and actually gives boy some attention. They both befriend the couple next to them. Fast forward a few minutes and whaddya know...THE MAN HIMSELF STOPS BY THE TABLE!!! The girl is so caught off guard and surprised that she abruptly stands up...and tips over her chair. Bobby Flay politely laughs and agrees to take a picture with his excited fan. The girl was so embarrassed that she can only fleetingly tell you the tarte tartin she got for dessert along with the complimentary sherry and biscotti were also fantastic.

969,9,8,5.0,"Back in my NYU days, I used to walk around in this area quite often in search of the notorious Num Pang sandwiches. Although there are a few other Italian restaurants in the area (Da Andrea and Vapiano to name a few), none do the craft quite as well as All'Onda. The hype is REAL!Prior to my visit, I made a reservation at 6:00pm, but as dinner with friends sometimes goes, a few of us (namely me!) missed the 15 minute grace period of our reservation. The hostesses were really nice and sweet and offered us a seat at the downstairs bar or the dining area near the door. That was fine with me, because our server (Kat) was the sweetest person ever! She kept checking in on us on drinks and appetizers before the last of our friends trickled in. I ordered the brussel sprouts and 3 cocktails for us - the Basil Gimlet being the most memorable. It was a tasty cocktail with basil syrup in it. What better than 2 things that I love mixed together? Basil and alcohol! An unusual, but very tasty mix. The brussel sprouts were cooked really well in a mixture of honey, curry, and pistachios.For our entrees, we ordered the Lumache (a lobster risotto), the Rigatoni (duck ragu and chocolate in a red wine sauce), and the infamous Bucatini (an eclectic mix of smoked uni and spicy bread crumbs atop pasta). The Lumache had a rich creamy texture and the chunks of lobster were a good addition to the dish. My friend liked the Lumache the most, but I didn't find it to be nearly as delicious as the other two dishes, which were packed full of flavor.The Rigatoni was my favorite dish by far! The rigatoni pasta was cooked perfectly to an al dente and the sauces were flavorful, but not overwhelming. The duck ragu was irresistibly tender and the portions of the protein in this dish were generous. The chocolate was very faint.This was my first time trying Uni so I had no idea what to expect. The Bucatini had a smooth buttery texture that was paired really well with the spicy bread crumbs. This was a wonderful mix of sensations that was a delicious experience to eat! The pasta noodles were again al dente, but a little softer than the duck ragu, which added to the buttery texture of this dish. Overall, I was really happy with this experience - everything from the service to the food to even the hidden bathroom on the first floor was absolutely fantastic. It's a really cute place for a girl's night out or a date. Heck, I might even bring my parents here when they come and visit.",14,0.9986

When my girlfriend's mother was looking for a place to celebrate her 50th, I eagerly pushed for Sammy's. I am glad I didn't end up looking like a shmegegge because we all had an AMAZING time! Let's start with the decor. Messy, dark, and cluttered; you'll feel you're basically in bubbe's bosom. Sitting at long communal tables decorated with pitchers of shmaltz and antiquated seltzer bottles, you're transported to a homestyle bar mitzvah from yesteryear.That's no reason not to get fapitzed though! Girls come well-heeled and men groomed so be sure not to come in any old shmata. The food here gets high marks for pushing the limits you thought your waistband could expand. Chopped chicken liver served up in a HUGE metal mixing bowl, delectable kreplach, latkes TO DIE FOR, garlicky beef sausages, and some of the juiciest skirt steak you've ever had (to name just a few dishes)! All this as I took shots of Ketel, which is served in a giant block of ice! If you're a health nut, stop being a piss-tachio and just ride the wave of fat with glee! Is this the best and most finely prepared meal you'll ever have? No, but that's what makes it authentic; this is REAL Jewish food done the right way.So why is Sammy my culinary beshert? Because of Dani Luv. Oh, what a shayna punim! He is the lox to my bagel. If you're a person who gets offended easily, then leave your tuchas at home because Dani doesn't pull any punches. He puts on a SPECTACULARLY hilarious cabaret performance complete with traditional Jewish standards and American classics. You'll be dancing the Hora around the tables, learning the original version of ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" and laughing so hard that you might burn off a latke or two. What I loved best though was the fact that Dani really plays to his audience (and off of them). We were a table full of Russians, as was another table that night (he joked that there were more Russians than humans that evening). For a majority of the night, he played all of the classic tunes we grew up on and really made us all feel such nachas! As for me, I will gladly come back to Sammy's and Dani Luv for another night of hard belly laughs and dangerous cholesterol levels.",6,0.9944

Massive variety.I'm not a fan of the upstairs restaurant or it's food which migrates down here. This place is good for a 2nd or 3rd place of the night.

They have an AYCD brunch that is damn good - though only if you order off a specific part of the menu (read: must have eggs). Been here with both large groups from 6 to 20, and smaller intimate brunches that are just the two of us. That said, every time I go to Agave, it is always an amazing experience - with attentive servers that generally make an effort to actually refill your drinks on unlimited brunch, to excellent food. I usually get the Sunrise Burrito, Energy Breakfast, or Egg White Frittata - I guess it depends if I'm trying to be ""healthy"" that day or not.The bottomless beverages only last two hours (which is really plenty) is until 4pm, and includes choice of mimosa, wine, champagne, or margarita. It appears they've raised the price by a few bucks as on their website it's posted at $27.95 ( I think it used to be $23.95 or something, so it's just a few extra bucks). Their guacamole and soups are good as well, but I usually stick to just my favorites - it's really hard to steer away when they are that good.Highly recommend Agave for brunch. :-)",17,0.9465

I've tried several of their soups, and they are delicious! Try the option of adding quinoa!When I called for delivery, they were so polite and honest about how backed up they were. They apologized and said it would be quite a long wait- and I loved that they were so sincere about it. They have healthy brunch options, and are very accommodating when it comes to making the plates vegan. The quinoa spinach cakes are delicious! I can't wait to come back and try their smoothies.

But far enough where you can talk without shouting, close enough where you can see the action and chefs at work. As a starter I ordered the burrata with prosciutto. The burrata was just how it is in Italy. Soft on the outside and super creamy on the inside so it oozes out a little when you cut it. The prosciutto was sliced very thinly and was very soft. I ordered the ravioli (raviolo since there was only one) with the quail egg. I compared it to the one at Armani, and it is just as good just different (says a lot since I'm obsessed with the one at Armani). Truffle butter and the egg was very runny and everything was just the right amount of messy. Soft pasta, cooked just right. Creamy cheese with just a very very small amount of spinach inside.Tried the tiramisu and chocolate cake. Chocolate cake had the soft melted hot chocolate on the inside. Not too spongey on the outside, again, just right. Taste tested everyone else's food and there wasn't one thing I disliked. Preferred some things over others, but that's just personal taste.

Expect a legit hole in the wall sushi bar but of course it is clean!It's hard for me to find amazing sashimi in the city unless you spend $$$$ on it. Nothing compares to the good quality at a $$ price like in California. But Tanoshi is a different story. Omakase that will actually fill you up for around $70-80 is a bargain in the city!

Anyways, it went ""How do you take 'em back to the farm after they've seen Paris..."" That is a perfect way to describe my experience here. How am I supposed to eat anywhere else after I've had the deliciousness that is Aurora? We started with wine, because... of course. The first bottle was from a vineyard in Tuscany that Aurora has a special arrangement with. They only produce 1500 bottles of this wine per year, and we had one of 'em. Talk about making a girl feel special! Then, when we finished that bottle we had the wine that Julia Roberts liked so much, that she agreed to endorse it for free in the movie Eat, Pray, Love. That bottle was even better than the first. Yum!We started with the artichoke appetizer special. OMG the artichoke special. It was flavorful and tender. It is the monster under my bed that causes dreams about it every night since trying it. And I'm not even a huge fan of artichokes!I arrived at the restaurant a few minutes early, so I sat at the bar and mingled with the other patrons, secretly pressing them for information on what to order. Lo and behold, I managed to find an off-duty food critic sitting at the bar. What luck! She suggested the Purple Haze (see my pictures) and the Paccheri alla Norma. Thanks to her for both. The Purple Haze beverage had a really fresh flavor to it. I'm always concerned that colorful drinks will be too syrupy. The Paccheri alla Norma was another winner. Many Italian restaurants rely on the deliciousness of cheese to win you over on a mediocre dish. Here at Aurora, the cheese was really secondary, and the chef allowed the eggplant and tomato to be the focus of the dish. Highly recommend. We stayed here for hours and I don't regret any minute of it. A little bit hidden away and hard to find, but it makes you feel like you've discovered a secret place all your own.

We finally made way on a Friday night, the wait was not too bad, we waited about 10-15mins for a table of 3.I'm not sure of all the dishes we ordered by their Greek names, since we had a actual Greek person w/us, we let him order :]-Veggie Chips w/Taziki Dip - this was yummy, their Taziki dip was very refreshing. You can taste the freshness.-Octopus - this is EVERTHING! So good. The octopus is so soft, not chewy at all! Our Greek friend told us the process to make this since his parents make it as well. The balsamic and olive oil they used goes very well w/the octopus. This is a MUST!-Lemon Potatoes - This was good, but nothing amazing. If you love potatoes, order it. -Greek Salad - I learned that a REAL Greek salad never has lettuce in it. This salad definitely does not have any leaves in it. Chunks of fresh tomatoes, blocks of fetas, olives, cucumbers and a little bit of olive oil, so simple yet so delicious! Definitely a MUST! I can see this being very refreshing on a Summer's day.-Red Snapper - we ordered this w/out the bones. It was prepared perfectly. Not too fishy, great w/the side of lemon potatoes. Our waiter was somewhat amazing. We ordered everything in Greek, he repeated it back in Greek and he didnt even write anything down! However, he got everything right! He didn't miss anything!!

I find it amusing that this place is classy and slightly expensive when Ootoyas in Japan are cheap and considered fast food. Still, this place is well worth your time and money.The staff is very polite and make the dining experience very pleasant. I love their interior decorating. It's very elegant with a mix of traditional/modern furnishings. It is dim inside but that adds to the dining experience. The restaurant is deceptively small. The small entrance makes it seem like it can sit only about 20 people, but it leads to a bar and quite a spacious dining area with upstairs seating. Still, this place is quite popular so you might have to wait up to and hour on a Thursday or Friday night. Other nights they have little to no wait. Unfortunately, they only accept reservations 6pm at night which is a downer for those who work late.The sets consist of a variety of small items, which may look like not a lot of food first, but is actually quite filling. These are the sets/items I've tried so far:Ika Shiokara - Sliced Raw Squid Cured in Salt and a Squid Liver Marinade. If you are not a fan of squid or anything slimy avoid this dish. Fortunately, I like both. This appetizer really packs a punch. I found the liver marinade extremely acidic and salty, with a very peppery taste. The marinade also gave the squid a slimier texture. Comes in a very little bowl so not sure if it was worth the $7.Hokke Yuan - The yuan sauce complements the grilled mackerel very well. The side of ponzu sauce they give you also tastes great with the white rice. The set comes with pickles, kabocha squash, miso soup, steamed egg, and grated mountain yam. The mountain yam (山藥 - San Yao in Chinese) has a weird texture when grated and raw. Tastes a lot better in soup or stir-fried.Tori Yuzu Kosho - The chicken thigh is very small but the but the Yuzu citrus pepper and sauce is amazing. Sweet, tangy, with a bite from the pepper. It has a kind of jelly-like consistency.Katsu Toji - Tonkatsu soaked in the soy sauce broth and was covered with scrambled egg. Really great flavor, but the breading was kind of soggy. I understand that's the nature of that dish, but a little crispiness would have made the dish even better. Eat this with rice to not waste the delicious soy sauce broth.Homemade Tofu - very soft and similar to the Cantonese dessert Douhua, except maybe the soybean flavor is stronger here. It comes with 3 salts. This was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again. Despite its freshness and it being homemade, it really is just tofu with fancy salt. Chawanmushi - Despite all the positive reviews of this, I'm actually not a big fan of their Chawanmushi. True, it has a very soft texture, but it's almost too soft and feels more like those Japanese pudding cups than steamed egg. It also has a plum-like flavor to it which makes it confusing whether it's a dessert or not.I would love to come back to try their Yakitori and get more of their Katsu.",18,0.9961

We were on our way home and walking to our car when we passed by this tiny little Taco spot. The waiting / ordering area is very narrow but there is just enough space to place your order your food. Despite many people being ahead of us in line, the wait was short and we were quickly served our tacos on metal plates. The guys here were really friendly and made our food very fast! We made our way to the back where there is limited seating. Honestly, the price is very reasonable, for $3 you get TWO tacos! This was absolutely a great way to end the night. We fully enjoyed our tasty tacos with onions and lime and the pork / beef meats that we chose. I'm not often in the East Village, but when I am, I think I will definitely be back. I can't say no to delicious and cheap tacos (especially after going out)!",15,0.9865

You know how professionals make it look effortless... well that was Victor. No tasting. Exact pours. Double fisted cocktail shaking and mixing. It was like watching an artist paint. I started with the Paddington. I wanted something fruity to cleanse my palate after destroying myself with a bacon wrapped hot dog and cheese fries at Crif Dogs. It was perfect. It contained Banks 5 Island Rum, Lillet Blanc, lemon and grapefruit juice, orange marmalade & St. George Absinthe. I loved it. The marmalade settled to the bottom and gave it a sweet finish. But I wasn't done yet. Next I ordered the Shark to keep the rum theme going. Plus, rum is my best friend. It's made with Butter infused Bacardi Silver Rum, Wray & Nephew Overproof Rum, Frangelico, Blue Curçao, lemon and pineapple juice, cream, Bittermans Elemakule Tiki Bitters. It's blue. How can you not love a blue drink? This one was even better than the Paddington. The overproof rum made it. I wanted another one, but note: they don't serve watered down drinks here. Heavy pours and lots of liquors. Two just became my PDT limit. Now I kinda wish PDT wasn't located inside Crif Dogs. I want to get dressed up and come here without smelling like fried food. It's quiet, sophisticated and too pricey to be juxtaposed with cheese fries and rootbeer floats. Uh oh! One trip to a speakeasy and I've become a total snob.",21,0.9425
981,42,43,5.0,"If there is one thing to be said about hidden gems is that you really hope no one discovers them and ruins your new secret hangout close to where you live. Being that this place is literally around the block from our apartment and down a side street along a spot on the Upper East Side/Yorkville part of town it seemed like a place that only a few locals would know about. It's in a barren stretch of an area that really needs an influx of new specialty bars and eateries such as this, and is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Alas, now that we have been here a few times and are fast becoming regulars we see that everyone else around here has also found out about Drunken Munkey. It's now at that point where you need a reservation to get in! The crowds have slowly discovered this wonderful new Indian craft cocktail bar and restaurant, and the adulation is much deserved!The Drunken Munkey - I really do love the name of this place - is being billed as New York City's first dedicated ""craft cocktail"" bar on the Upper East Side. They serve a selection of classic cocktails, wines, spirits and cordials along with offering comforting dishes of Indian style cooking. The decor reminds one of a throwback to the times of Colonial India with a generous touch of the legendary flavors and style of famous cafes and supper clubs you used to find in ""Old Bombay"". It's a cozy but whimsical spot with an affable owner, terrific staff, skilled mixologists, and downright delicious food. How can you go wrong with that? Well, you can't and Drunken Munkey is helping to usher in a new generation of affordable upscale eateries and cocktail emporiums to this barren stretch of the UES. We need more ""flavor"" up here and it is a delight to see it has arrived.It's the kind of spot that once you get there you settle in and never want to leave. Warm and inviting to help battle the cold of this long winter it fits like a comfortable set of gloves that you don't want to take off. It's a place that I can see as a date spot, or for friends and family to meet up at for a dinner over spitited conversation, or for those just looking to have a few cocktails and a bite at the bar in a lively environment. With such attention to the little things you will see monkey laden images and statues along the bar, mini bicycles along the wall shelves, grainy black and white photos of old Bombay, cricket ball bathroom door handles, and even the waitresses are dressed in churidar kurtas giving off such a cool ambiance to dine and enjoy. The one flat screen they have features Bollywood movies and Indian programming, while the music playing in the background features an eclectic mix of old jazz, to 70' and 80's hits, Indian tunes, to some rock. Somehow, it all works here. Can be a bit loud and boisterous at moments being that it is a small space but that just adds to the fun.As for the food? Now that we have dined here a few times I can say it really is delicious and I think I might become an Indian food addict here. We started of with an appetizer of Paani Puri -crispy flour puffs, aloo & chick-pea chaat, with tamarind mint water. Something I never had but was oddly good and fun to eat. Okra was off the hook! Crispy okra, onions, tomato & chat masala. These are dangerous! Mine! Mine! All mine! My precious!The Butter Chicken Tikka Masala is a classic comfort dish and they do it right! Everything is served on one large plate which makes it all too easy - main course, raita & ghee rice, kachumber, and some perfectly fluffy naan. Mmmmm......I could eat this every day. That soft tasty chicken. That creamed tomato sauce. Oh my. No really, I could eat this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Don't judge me! If an Indian restaurant can't do Tikka Masala right then I avoid it, but the Munkey has an experienced chef that is a master at what he does. The libations here are nothing to sniff at as they list a classic offering of old school cocktails for $12. Served in ornate glassware the bartenders here are killer and mix a mean drink. Pimms Cup, Singapore Sling, East India Cocktail, Royal Enfield Sidecar, Old Fashioned, among others help quench your thirst with a generous pour and enrich your soul. Even if you don't eat here it is a destination spot to drop in and have a drink to end your night or start it off. Don't forget dessert! Gajar Halwa - carrot pudding, crushed nuts, cardamom coconut creme is something that doesn't sound right but makes an amazing sweet concotion to top off a meal here. Just. So. Good. Listen to me and get it. You're welcome!I think I will become fast friends with this Drunken Munkey. He taunts me with awesome drinks and delectable food. He lives right around the block from me and might become a bad influence! You know how those monkeys are!",56,0.9985

Being that I'm a bit overworked and stressed the past few months, I wanted to take on some bikram, 90 minutes of ""ME TIME"". SO HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND BYLES (my only wish is that I've known about it sooner)! I don't mind wearing a bikini on the beach, but I do mind being half naked in a room with a bunch of people (hence why I prefer not to go to the gym). I am also not a fan of working out. This place however is completely unpretentious, warm, and welcoming. No one forces you to buy any packages or pushes anything on you. You just walk in, do your thing, and walk out feeling fantastic!If you're a beginner like me, def read the website on the ""what to do's"" before entering your first class. I read it twice. Brought my own mat, drank plenty of water the night before, had a masterlock to keep my things in the locker, had a BIG BOTTLE OF WATER in class, and brought the proper attire (with a change of clothes after). You're going to be sweating...ALOT. When I took my first class, I was like holy crap, I've never sweated so much in my life. Don't even worry about looking like a mess cause everyone in that room is sweating with you. Don't even fret about not getting the moves correctly! The instructors (my fave is Pamela) are super helpful and I've never felt uncomfortable in class. I truly enjoy bikram. I use to dread doing any type of exercise, but having missed a class here, I woke up the next day excited to go in. A plus: I've noticed I'm a lot calmer, healthier, more focused, and have been eating better. Let your guard down and get your bikram on!

984,6,7,5.0,"Man, I love Mancora. Although I commonly mistake it for the the Mancala game or the Macondo AYCD brunch spot, I still know this little corner spot in East Village has the best ceviche I've ever had (and that includes the amazing-but-contaminated real thang my friends and I paid the price for in Cuzco and Lima). You won't find better bang for your buck - the various mountainous rawesome entrees at Mancora are officially the ONLY ceviches that will completely fill you up, and at only $15 or so each. The norteña, with a variety of fish and shellfish in a flavorful, tangy lime/tomato sauce and fresh avocado, wins by a landslide, with the mixto de mariscos, a shellfish-only specialty bathed in a simpler lime juice base, in second place. Although their house hot sauce is nowhere close to Mamoun's on the scorch scale, it has some bite, and I'm a fan. While the ceviches take the cake, the skirt steak with fried egg is a bit hit with mis amigos, and the pisco sours are amazing and great on the wallet at $7 a pop. The appetizers are NOT to be missed, particularly the grilled octopus and calamari. The octopus in panca sauce is deliciously tender, but not for the faint of heart: these little babies are served grilled and whole, with tiny tender heads just asking to be torn off their deliciously chewy little tentacle bodies with your teeth (after being dipped in their amazing side sauces, of course!). Yum. Mancora accommodates large groups, reservations are honored on time, and you can typically make arrangements at the last minute. It's MUCH quieter at lunch or brunch (and there are great specials under $10), and loud, crowded, and more divey for dinner, but the delicious food and efficient service never waiver. After three years of living in Manhattan, I decided to have my most recent birthday group dinner here.

985,16,10,5.0,"The Ginger Man will undoubtedly become your favorite bar of all-time if you are a fan of beer, and I mean beer from all over the world. Okay, maybe you may not like beer, but I think you'll come to love beer because of The Ginger Man. This bar is just fantastic, and it's certainly one of the best bars I've encountered in the city. From draft to bottled, they go beyond domestics and possess a selection like no other -- Perhaps over 100 types of beers are available, over 60 of which are on tap. Aside from having a fantabulous beer menu, the atmosphere is inviting, warm, spacious, casual, and just perfect for any occasion. It does tend to get busy at certain times, so getting a table can be a bit of a challenge; first come, first serve. I advise coming here earlier than later, especially on an inevitably busy night. I'd say it always gets packed after 9PM. Service is always great though in spite of the bustle. Their staff is super-friendly and advise on what types of beers to try. While they have food, it is sub-par and average. I wouldn't say that is the focus here. They print a new menu daily. Front and back of their daily beer menu, they have what seems like an overwhelming list of beers on draft or bottled. However, they organize the beers nicely. They list the location of the brewery, the number of ounces served, the price, the ABV, and the type (IPA, Amber, Lager, Cider, etc). It takes out most of the guesswork because of how well they organize their list. For those who know their beers and those who don't, The Ginger Man will guide you to the right choice of beverage based on your personal tastes. My favorite part of this bar is that they serve the beers in their proper glasses, even sometimes with the proper branding/label on them. You won't be sipping out of generic pint glasses or mugs here.All in all, The Ginger Man is one of my top bars in the city. I honestly love this place too much. It's always beyond reliable. I've only told all my friends and their mothers about this place, and I can tell you that no one I've recommended this bar to has left disappointed. They take beer seriously here, and if you are a beer connoisseur, you will need to make a mandatory trip to The Ginger Man. For those who aren't keen on beer, they do have a full bar, although I can't speak for their pricing. Otherwise, you shall not be disappointed by what they have to offer with regards to beer, beer, and more beer. Take my word for it.",22,0.9938

988,13,9,5.0,"There's a book I read year ago called the Miracle of Mindfulness by Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh. It essentially talks about the principles that govern Buddhism: the incredible power of living in the moment, being fully cognizant of one's surroundings and the details that compose each aspect of our lives. It's a practice in awareness. Anyway, there's this section where he discusses eating: we typically chew fast, whether out of hunger or a desire to move on to the next thing in our day or because it's what we're used to. He suggests chewing slowly, taking note of each facet of what we're eating: where it came from, how it was made ... really relishing the sacredness of food as something that nourishes our bodies and is a part of the cycle of life. I bring this up because the practice of mindful eating was never something I have personally experienced. I'm a food lover and oftentimes that translates into me DEVOURING my food, gobbling up all it sweet-salty-light-rich-filling-creamy-tart-acidic perfection. My trip to Sushi Nakazawa was my first practice in mindful eating. But I'll get back to that in a moment.  So several weeks ago, I received an email from my husband, subject ""THIS PLACE LOOKS GREAT!!"" The body of the email was the link to the now famous New York Times Review ... yeah, the one that led the New York Times to declare Sushi Nakazawa as the Best Restaurant in NY for 2013. I was aware of the 30 day + reservation wait, but I decided to try anyway. I was desperate for a great Christmas present for Brian (this, with only a week left until Christmas and still no gift for him). I called and a fabulous female British (Kiwi?) voice answered. After explaining my dilemma, she kindly squeezed us in for the following Friday at 7 pm. He was surprised... completely clueless until we were steps away from the restaurant. It was fantastic.  The restaurant is definitely a study in understated and minimalistic elegance. There are only 10 tables in the whole restaurant. The coveted sushi bar was the first thing we saw when we walked in, Daisuke Nakazawa in the center flanked by his other chefs. We were seated quickly at a table. The restaurant's sake sommelier approached the table to inquire about food preferences and allergies, and take our drink orders. We opted for the $40 sake special (dubbed the best drink deal in NY by Adam Platt) to accompany or omakase. The sake pairings were delicious and portions were the perfect size to accompany each dish without overpowering it.  We were each brought a small dish of pickled ginger, the only condiment we would be offered that night. One of the servers then brought our first course, two pieces of sushi on a rectangular white dish. Brian and I looked at each other. ""How are we going to get full on this?"" we telepathically inquired. We both picked up our chopsticks and started with the sushi on the right. Initially, I chewed slowly because I wanted to savor it, in case we wouldn't be getting our next course for a while. But then I instinctively closed my eyes. I tasted the tartness of the rice wine vinegar, the buttery richness of the fish, the slight spice of the miso. It all melted together down my throat and I was amazed. There was no spicy mayo, no soy sauce, no vegetables or tempura batter or fruit to mask the flavor. It was just us and the fish. As the courses progressed, we realized we'd be more than satisfied with our servings. At one point, I inquired about how sushi pieces were paired together. The server explained that like fish was paired: tuna, roe, salmon, mackerel, shrimp, urchin, eel ... I'm fairly certain they ran the gamut with the selections. At one point, I inquired about Chef Nakazawa's signature dish. The server smiled ""that's your next course ... the final course"". I've never been one for Tamago, but when it takes anyone 10 years to master something, you have to feel a certain giddiness about it. It was smooth, creamy, delicately sweet and a perfect end to the omakase. The sommelier returned to our table. ""At this point, would you like to revisit any dishes that you've already tried, or perhaps continue the experience with some new dishes?"" I felt a little bit like Alice with that one. How much more was there to try? We decided on two additional pieces each (or $40 additional). The omakase was completed with a sorbet dish, served with pomegranate seeds and raspberries.  As we sat waiting for the check, it dawned on me what tremendous confidence Chef Nakazawa must have in his craft to serve 21 pieces of sushi that are so fresh, so superior in quality, that he offers nothing else at his restaurant: no amous bouche, no appetizers, no sides, no condiments. And in truth, his confidence is well deserved and fully earned. His sushi was the freshest and most delicious in its subtle flavors that I have ever had. As we began to walk out, I caught Chef Nakazawa's eyes. He smiled a full smile, one that started in his eyes and expressed deep gratitude at o",25,0.9991

Where in the world can you find Ethiopian, Sri Lankan, Indonesian, Trinidadian food all within a few miles of each other?I've had Sri Lankan food at Banana Leaf and really enjoyed it, so when friends wanted to come here, I was really excited about it. I didn't know there was another place in the city that serves Sri Lankan food. Cool, it pays to have friends. Sigiri is named after ""Sigiriya,"" which is also known as Lion Rock in Sri Lanka. Not sure what the connection is, as I didn't get a chance to read the description on the back of the menu. Sigiriya is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Cool, I also learned something on top of eating delicious food. For appetizers, we tried the Dhal Vade (lentil patties) and fish cutlets. Although fried, both were extremely tasty and came with interesting side sauces. For the main entree, I had the vegetable curry ($9.50). They have a few veggie choices which included string beans, beets and also soy protein. You cannot get a mixture, and have to order just one of kind of veggie. I was a bit bummed about that.To accompany the curry, we also ordered a side of Pol Roti ($9.95), which is a coconut roti, but it reminds me of cassava cakes I had in the Caribbeans. Our party also ordered a side of hoppers($11.95), which are water-thin, bowl-shaped pancakes and the consistency reminds me of a dosa.

All three of these items was absolutely amazing.To start, the Burrata was unbelievable. It's one of the best burratas I've had in Manhattan and I wasn't expecting it at all since this is not an Italian restaurant. The outside was not overly tough and the inside was perfect - the right balance between runny and firm. The glaze it sat on top of was pleasantly sweet and the basil was thin and delicate. Combining each of these with the cherry tomatoes surrounding the mozzarella and it tasted heavenly! I would strongly recommend ordering this course.The Duck Breast was cooked perfectly! The slices were moist throughout, pink in the middle and the skin was crispy and tasty. It came with a nice arugala salad, two pieces of brie and some blackberries. When I first read the entree's description on the menu, I was a little confused about the blackberries, but they definitely worked! There was something about the savory flavor of the duck breast pieces and the sweetness of the blackberries, that when combined, made the dish even better.Finally, the Striped Bass. The fish was perfectly moist all the way throughout (and it was a very thick piece). There were no bones to worry about, and the ginger crust was really crunchy, yet not burned or crispy. It sat on a bed of sweet corn and mushrooms that was absolutely amazing! I'm usually not impressed by corn, but this was really good. The sweet flavor of the corn with the bitterness of the mushrooms went perfectly with the soft, tender striped bass. I want to recommend this dish too, but unless I'm really lucky, everything on the menu at this place is probably amazing.One unfortunate thing - they no longer offer the Bone Marrow. In place of the Bone Marrow they are now offering a Mussels appetizer instead.

A large group of friends and I ended up here hungry after a day rock-climbing, so we tried everything that still remained for the opening. A great, healthy place that has some of the best-tasting, heart-healthy choices I've seen.Atmosphere: This sandwich shop is SO New York. Unlike the many questionably sanitary delis across Manhattan, this establishment's distressed wood, with stainless steel walls and minimalist light fixtures speak higher end. I really love the large full wall chalk board menu. Simple but practical. For my tree-hugging friends, you will be delighted by the compost, recycle, and trash break-out. I also very much appreciated ""local water"" is free in pitchers. Such an up-scale name for tap water. The Service: It's counter service, staffed by friendly folks who are happy to suggest. The menu is quite small, so they all know it well. Sandwich creation is pretty efficient. The Food: Good ingredients are always at the core of good food. In this case, this place is a thumbs up. All sandwiches are made with toasted ciabatta bread. Sandwiches are between $9-13. That seems expensive, but these are pretty special.  Rosemary Limeade: Yums. Highly recommended. Hibiscus Lemonade: A tasty refreshing treat, even in chilly weather. Will be lovely once NY temps warm up.Chili - Fresh, well-made, hits the spot, but I am a chili snob. This one gets 3 stars, a solid rating, but not spectacular. The Butt - This is a pulled pork sandwich with a dijon mustard (felt more like wasabi mustard) and broccoli rabe. I give it 4 stars because my friends loved it. I thought the rabe was slightly bitter for my tastes. I would have the chef look into ways to mask this bitterness a bit more. Sheemakers Bounty - For my vegetarian friends out there, this is a must try. The texture of the ciabatta bread with the cooked broccoli and almond butter is wonderful. The pickled raisin jelly is impressive to balance out the flavors. 5 stars.General Zapata - Think far healthier version of chicken parm sandwich and you will love this. The cilantro and radishes give it unique texture and flavor. 5 stars. Hot and spicy broccoli rabe. A bit bitter for me, but one of my friends loved it so much he got a side to go with his sandwich. Grain salad - They have to come up with another name for this, as it's actually looks visually like a rice pilaf salad. The rice looking stuff is actually not rice, but I think barley, and is extremely high in fiber. It includes mint, little jalapenos (not spicy somehow), little oranges and more. Definitely try this unique mix of flavors 5 stars.Sweet and sour cabbage - It's a mild, less tart version of sauerkraut, but so much better. Delicious. Good Batch Cookie - This is the texture of a short bread, with that slightly greater salt content. I found it quite delicious. 4 stars.Stroopwaffel -This must mean ""pure deliciousness"" in some foreign language. It looks like two waffle looking but flat hand size cookies glued together with sweet honey-like goodness. It's sweet, but not too sweet. Yum. 5 stars.The establishment also has beer and wine, in case you want to imbibe a bit before heading further for the evening.",27,0.9995

SMDH..I come here for lunch but I have someone with me who I never dined with before. I'm sitting next to a gentleman who I see orders this OUTRAGEOUS looking pizza. Meats, cheeses and the guy is by himself. I wanted to lean over and say Damn son, pass me a slice!This person who I was with, I'm not sure of her pizza funkiness. She says order anything and is fine with my choice, I want to order the CALABRESE with thick-cut pepperoni and homemade fennel sausage and her saying I don't like the spices isn't cool. I want to be respectful and I order the classic with fresh whole milk mozzarella, (I'm coming back here with my kids to get me some homemade fennel sausage)Our waiter? All over us, he brings out two oils. One is a chili infused olive oil and the other is regular olive oil along with my beer that I forgot the name, It was an IPA called sweet ass beer? I don't remember and the website doesn't show drinks.The pizza comes out and its bangin'! The crust is nice, its different. It's not like a Forcella pizza, soft and charred. Its not like a big 8 slice Pizza and its definitely not like Groupo pizza with its thin cracker crust.NO! Its like a Michael White, Chef owner of Osteria Morini pizza. (Kinda like Two Boots pizza but smaller) a corn meal, thin crusted pizza topped with some great cheese and sauce. It's not a NYC pizza but a Midwestern, Michael White pizza. Can I get an Amen?I'm getting ready to pay and I see Michael White! I walk over to him, say hello chef and told him I wrote the ROTD for Marea, He then rips up the check and says thank you. (Yeah right)This guy is like an Andre the Giant size dude. Massive! I shook his hand and it was like shaking hands with a buncha bananas. If I put a cap on him, he'd be a great Little John in Robin Hood. All these chefs, Alex Guarnaschelli looks like a girl from my neighborhood in Brooklyn. Iron chef??

Showcasing Isan cuisine that is now all the rage when it comes to Thai restaurants in the city, at Somtum Der you can get some of the best Papaya salads (Som Tums) and fried chicken in Manhattan. Two versions of the Som Tum that I've liked at the restaurant include a version with egg (Thai Kai Kem) that cuts the burn of the chillies and a more complex one (som tum poo-plara) with fermented fish sauce and (hard to the point of being inedible) miniature crabs. The fried chicken (Sa Poak Kai Tod Der) consists of juicy thigh meat encased in a crisp shell sprinkled with fried garlic and accompanied by a mild chili sauce. It's not a dish to be shared, and one to be ordered time and again besting almost all interpretations of the dish in the city. Should you be looking for something grilled as opposed to fried, skip the boring skewers in favor of the house special grilled marinated beef (Nue Rong Hai Der and Khao Ji). The spicy salads (larb) are also a strong suite and my favorite is the one with crunchy, grilled catfish with lime and fish sauces, dried chilies, and toasted ground rice. The rice and noodles dishes may not be the strongest feature, still for something different you can try the chef's signature wok-fried seafood suki.The range of flavors will ensure that your body movements are not limited to squirming and sweating uncomfortably at the spice level (though my lips did go numb after requesting one of the Papaya salads to be extra spicy), but in case you need to calm the taste buds end the meal with the Thai Tea Panna Cotta that comes with a small cup of condensed milk that needs to be drizzled over the dessert. While the Panna Cotta may occasionally lack the right texture, it's a fine way to end the meal with a light dessert -leaving you in the right mood to get back to yelp to rectify the injustice of an average 3.5 yelp rating. Somtum Der deserves better after doing its best to balance all the crappy Thai restaurants in the city that serve meals that range across the spectrum from ""bland"" to ""pepper-heads only"".",35,0.8653
999,20,16,5.0,"Eddie's is my main draw at the extensive network of shops and restaurants in the Concourse at Rockefeller Center.They purportedly ""specialize"" in a long list of services--soles, heels, custom dyeing, boot and handbag repair, zipper and lining repairs in leather apparel and shoe shines. But any casual passerby or serious client at Eddie's knows that it is all about the shoe shine. Five chairs. Thirty-minute wait times. Twenty-minute cleaning service. An intense routine involving an array of polishes and rag cloths. And service with a smile. For a mere $2.50!! I cannot cite a better bargain in the city. A minimum wage assumption of $7.25 per hour would suggest a 20 minute upper bound for the shoe shine, and I think Eddie's is pushing the limit. But then not all of the spoils end up with the shoe shine guys, so tip them liberally ... at least $3 or even $5. No one works harder for their money than Eddie's team.With one's shoes taking a beating in the snow and cold, and given the relative comfort of the concourse in times of bad weather, Eddie's does experience a surge in business during the winter and, consequently, the wait times are longer.

1001,13,8,5.0,"I've been saving this restaurant as a meaty reward for my boyfriend, who's been very good at eating his veggies. In my mind, this is the quintessential ""New York"" restaurant. There's a unique character to the fare (meat and beer and bicycles... oh my!), it's small and intimate, with a heated garden in colder weather, the playlist is a mish-mash of the greatest artists you've never heard of, and the service is absolutely top-notch. It's a hidden gem in this neighborhood.The restaurant doesn't take reservations for small parties, but on a Friday night at 8pm, we only waited 10 minutes for two seats to open up. We were seated at the communal table, where I rubbed elbows with my neighbors all night. Seating quarters are cramped. You've been warned!Bad news first: the restaurant was all out of Pig's Head, which was a bit disappointing since Yelpers rave about that dish (Looking at you, Xavier!). Good news: we ordered the Tandoori Lamb Belly, which looked so delectable when plated, everyone's eyes were focused on our food for a good 10 minutes. The entree is designed to be consumed by two people, but I cannot fathom how two people could finish all that food. The Lamb Belly is intensely rich and fatty. One bite and you've pretty much filled up on your cholesterol and caloric intake for the day. It comes with a side of watermelon chili lime salad. The crisp flavor of the watermelon helped sooth the fattyness pooling up in my mouth.As for drinks, we paired the lamb with the Gouden Corolus Dark Ale upon our server's recommendation. He knew his ish, because it was one of the tastiest beers I've had in a while.  The restaurant also sells the beer it serves, so I will be picking up some for at-home revelries.Now for the best news: Service is what bumps this to a 5 star review. The staff is friendly, so welcoming, and so knowledgeable about the dishes, the beer pairings, and so forth. It made my experience that much more enjoyable, and I'm definitely going to be a returning diner.PS. This would be a great spot for a gentlemen's chat over charcuterie and beer.

I suggest you stop whatever you are doing and run to Cheeky for the best chicken sandwich of your life! You think Chick-fil-A is the best? This chicken sandwich blows theirs out of the fucking water. I will deconstruct the sandwich and then give you a few personal impressions: 1. Incredible homemade biscuit placed on griddle (they also sell just the biscuit with jam in the mornings). 2. Marinated chicken, breaded or floured, and then deep fried to order.3. Red cabbage soaked in vinegar (this gives great texture and cuts the richness).4. Cream based gravy put on top of the chicken.5. Each element is thoughtful and delicious on its own, but put everything together and you are transported to a special place...umami heaven!6. When I die (which may be soon, if I keep eating here), I want to be reincarnated as a kosher chicken (gots to keep it real) and then promptly slaughtered and made into a Cheeky chicken sandwich...THAT GOOD! 7. Only $6 for the chicken sandwich and only a 5 min walk from my apt...bring on the morbid obesity, you don't scare me. 8.

1007,16,20,5.0,"All of these reviews are like ""the bartenders are great, they shake your hand,"" yadda, yadda, yadda. I have a much better story about the bartenders. I wish I had a video of The Incident because it is probably one of the best things (the best thing?) I have seen to date in a bar. Let me set the stage for you. It was Halloween weekend. The bar was crowded, but not packed, something like 10 pm. You might be interested to know they were running some unlimited drinks special, something like $40 for 3 hours of AYCD (they are doing a similar special for NYE). I was sitting at the bar next to a girlfriend. There were a couple of bartenders working. One was dressed as Batman. The patrons were varying degrees of drunk, but a very congenial bunch. In particular, there was one especially drunk Banana intent on flirting with every girl there, etc. He was harmless. However, there was one weirdo by himself, a post-middle aged man that I would venture to guess was under the influence of something in addition to alcohol. He was being seriously weird; it's hard to describe. He was standing behind me. I'm sitting there, chatting with Batman, who's slinging drinks and being very friendly when glass comes flying over my shoulder and smashing into the wall behind the bartender. Both of us are lucky we didn't get cut. The drunk post-middle aged man had smashed his glass into the brick wall behind me, and the shattered glass ricocheted across the bar. I can't even tell you how fast, so incredibly fast, Batman raced all the way down to the end of the bar and all the way back up to the front of the pub and pushed post-middle age drunk guy out of the bar (drunk guy's hand was bleeding profusely). Drunk post-middle age guy was furious, but Batman, oh-so-super-hero-ly forced him out and then SLAMMED THE DOOR! The whole bar erupted into applause and started chanting BATMAN! BATMAN! BATMAN!It was pretty epic. This is a no-frills kind of place. Very comfortable, not a see-and-be-seen place. I'd give it an imaginary sixth star if it would expand the beers on tap, or even just switch out the stuff you can get everywhere (like Guinness, Blue Moon, etc.) for a craft brew or two.",14,0.9812
1008,14,6,5.0,"Dinner at Bohemian is one of the most intriguing meals I've had so far in New York. Bohemian is a ""secret"" Japanese restaurant hidden behind a butcher shop in NoHo, and the only two legit ways to get their phone number (which isn't publicized on their website) are to 1) get it from someone who's been there before, or 2) email them with a self-introduction as per the instructions on their site. I love Japanese small plates style restaurants, so I decided to take the plunge and email them directly. Apparently ""Hi! I would like to inquire about making a reservation. I have heard great things about your restaurant and would love to visit sometime"" didn't suffice; I ended up emailing them an entire paragraph about myself before getting a positive response, and a month later I was on my way to dinner there with three of my friends.After finding the butcher shop storefront and walking down the long hallway next to it, we rung the doorbell and were ushered into a small, living room-esque space. It was a very intimate, lounge-y atmosphere complete with comfy armchairs and a small Japanese garden. Our reservation was at 6:30pm on a Saturday and we were the first people there, but within half an hour the place was already filling up.We were too indecisive to pick multiple dishes to order, so we opted for the $58 tasting menu--1) Farmer's Fresh Vegetable Fondue - The server brought the fondue first, let it warm up with a flame underneath, and then brought out what looked like a forest of colorful veggies planted in ice. There were red and orange cherry tomatoes, purple carrots, bell peppers, radishes, and purple lettuce leaves. The fondue was made of cream cheese, and it was yummy and flavorful without being too rich.2) Uni Croquette - The inside of the croquette was filled with warm mushroom cream, and it was topped off with dollops of uni. The uni was delicious, not too briny tasting, though I wish there had been more of it... I finished off the uni long before I finished the rest of the croquette.3) Washu Beef Short Rib Sashimi - My favorite dish of the meal! A bit of internet research tells me that Bohemian actually sources its beef from the butcher shop out front, Japan Premium Beef, which sells some very high quality (and expensive) wagyu beef. Each person got four bite-size pieces, and the beef was extremely tender. It came with garlic soy sauce for dipping, as well as pickled cauliflower on the side.4) Pan Roasted Branzini- A big dish that came with two whole branzini. The fish was lightly seasoned, and very meaty and filling. There were lots of grilled vegetables with the fish - potatoes, zucchini, brussel sprouts, garlic (an entire bulb!), and green beans. 5) Ikura Caviar Rice Bowl - The menu gives you the option of choosing between either the Ikura Caviar Rice Bowl or Bohemian's Washu Beef Mini Burger, and I decided to go with the rice bowl. There was a plentiful amount of ikura on the rice, and it was super juicy. On the side were cucumbers and tosazu jelly. I didn't know what tosazu was so I was expecting it to be something like ponzu, but it was much less pungent - turns out that, like ponzu, it's a vinegar based sauce, but without the citrus flavor that ponzu has.6a) Honey Lemon Panna Cotta - The panna cotta itself was amazing, super milky and creamy. I wasn't a fan of the lemon jelly on top though; it was too sour compared with the panna cotta's sweetness.6b) Sake Panna Cotta - Two of my friends got this instead, since our server told us they were running low on honey lemon and asked if some of us were willing to substitute it with the sake one instead. It was presented with a shot glass of unfiltered sake to be poured over the plain panna cotta, which was pretty interesting. Great food aside, one of my favorite moments of the night was when the manager came over to talk to us. He had read my introduction email and proceeded to talk about everything I said in it. He also told us a bit about himself too. What a wonderful personal touch to dinner!Conclusion: Dinner at Bohemian was fantastic, and I know I'll definitely be back. The tasting menu was a good choice since it was our first time there, but I think I'll order off the à la carte menu next time to try some of their other yummy looking dishes.",24,0.9987
1009,12,6,5.0,"Hello, lover. So it was an absolutely freezing evening in NYC. I was all ""hot toddies, please."" But I really wanted to try something new, and all my old favorites just get so crowded. What's a girl gotta do to get a hot cocktail and a cozy armchair in this city? Make it herself at home?? Not an option. But.NY Mag had done an article on best winter bars, so like any self-respecting New Yorker, I jotted notes about the best looking places into my iPhone. I had this little list and picked The Third Man because it was closest to my apartment and also boasted hot mulled cider. I went with my bestie JAK. We literally couldn't bundle ourselves enough to be warm on the way to the bar. But that's okay because once we were inside, it was toasty-city. It was very rustic, wood, steel, more wood. A U-shaped bar right in the middle and a few cozy booth-like tables spotted around. There were two empty booths so we grabbed one. It was pretty awesome. It was all snuggly and raised off the floor, which always makes me feel just a little more tucked away. No waitress service, but that's okay with me, my legs arn't broken. The menu had quite a few drinks I would like to try, but of course I went with one of my top two winter favorites, hot mulled cider with whiskey. JAK got the same thing. It was really, really hot. We definitely couldn't drink it right away. Which was fine, because even though the bar was super warm, my hands were still cold, so I wrapped them around my glass. When I could finally try it, it was really good. No frills, classic and well flavored. It also had a really great whiskey to cider ratio, which is always a concern. Too much whiskey really ruins your hot cider. Not enough whiskey is a like child's play. These bartenders got it right.We sat for quite some time with our drinks. The noise level was low, great for conversation, but not so quiet you could hear the guy across the room from you sneeze. The patrons were friendly, everyone seemed to have the same purpose: warm up with booze. When we were getting ready to bundle up again and head back out into the cold, it was definitely far more crowded than when we first got there nearly 2 hours earlier (we arrived around 10PM on a Saturday). I'm a bit fearful about adding another five star review to The Third Man, because I'll bet you by next winter you can't get in, much less get a table. For now, I will enjoy the welcomed cozy wintery bar while it's still relatively easy to get a table. Cheers, Third Man. You won my hot cocktail loving heart.",17,0.9983

They're the opposite of pushy, so I don't feel pressured to buy anything that I really don't need.I found out that they also fit running shoes. They have treadmills with cameras attached that you can see how you run, so you know what kinda support you need. I actually bought a pair of shoes elsewhere, and it is giving me some IT band issues. I went in to ask if I could buy insoles (because it would make no sense to buy another pair of shoes) for the shoes. And I asked if I could bring the shoes in next time, and see if insoles are the solution. They were more than fine with that!They have a great rewards program, which you don't need a card, membership fees, or harassment. Just state your name, and every $100 you spend, you get awesome free things that's not ""store credit"", (which prompts you to buy more things.)There was this one guy, whom I'm sure was his first day on the job, who was less knowledgeable on a pair of swim goggles. But he's really nice, so 5-stars away!",15,0.9837
1013,10,8,5.0,"Dear Katz,I have been waiting for years to come to this place. In fact, I have been waiting for 3 years! Don't ask me why I waited this long, I am glad I finally made it here.It was late at night, around 3am, from what I recall from my blurred memory. I walked out of the club and realized that Katz was across the street, a 1 minute stumble in heels. That seemed manageable. I pointed at it, and my girlfriends all agreed to go there. We stumbled in to Katz, stood in line to get out tickets and all got our roast beef sandwiches. It was surprisingly crowded at 3am, I guess all drunk people love to pig out. These sandwiches were massive. The guy working at the counter was nice enough to let us sample some of the roast beef. After picking up my sandwich, I made my way to the French fries station and got a plate of amazing fries. No, the not the limp ones like in McDonalds, these were nice, fat pieces of French fries. Then I made a stop at the beverage station for a bottle of water.Finally I sat down and started working on my roast beef sandwich. It was amazing. The roast beef was perfectly tender, and the greasy French fries complimented it. I managed to get through half my sandwich and took home the rest in a take out container. Then I walked to the cashier and paid almost $30. It was not cheap, but well worth it.The next day, I woke up, with no hangover. Thanks Katz!",9,0.9465
1014,17,6,5.0,"Does the transitive property mean that dining at Contra is equivalent to dining at Noma, Isa, and Mugaritz? Probably not, but who cares. Contra is an outsanding restaurant on its own and the chefs here have done an excellent job incorporating their past experiences to create a menu that is both exciting and delicious. I'm not a big fan of charging extra for bread, but if you just factor the $3 into the total cost, the overall meal is well worth $58. Or just a tiny bit more, if you add on a supplement, which I did. The goat's head is delicious by the way*, the brain is akin to bone marrow, if you're into that savory/succulent kind of thing. Don't be so afraid. I can't wait to come back.*Yes, the eyeball does taste quite gelatinous, but I heard it improves your own eyesight as much as 2 pounds of carrots does, so feel free to forego your annual eye examination after eating it!

1016,15,14,5.0,"Summary: This is as fine a speakeasy as you'll find in NYC. Compared to places like Raines or Angel's Share, Little Branch is more pared down, less plush, less pretty, less designy. But it knows what it's doing: it gets at the same sweet spot as the other places, it just does it by different means. Perfect for dates, and, also, for everything else.Details:- Came on a Monday at 7:30pm--it was nearly empty but filled up nicely over the next few hours. By 9 or 10pm, they started up with the live jazz. No vocalist, just a few instrumentalists providing background music you pleasantly half-recognize. Really well done.- Every other reviewer is correct: don't even look at the menu, just get the bartender's choice. The folks here know what they're doing. I had 6 drinks here and sampled my companion's 5 drinks--so, 11 in all, and not a dud among them. Not one. That's pretty impressive. Our drinks were varied, too--based on tequila, mezcal, gin, vodka, rum--and our requests became laxer as time passed: by the fifth drink, I think I literally just said, ""vodka!"", and the server said, ""sure!"" And a few minutes later, hey presto, a cocktail appeared, customized for me based on what I'd asked for previously.- Drinks are $13 each, which is a lot until you consider how other places of this sort charge $15-18, and sometimes more. To boot, the staff seemed pleasantly surprised that we were staying for more than a drink or two (maybe most people just pop in here to see what the fuss is all about, then skedaddle?), so they bought us a round. We got eleven drinks but paid for nine. Just remember: cash only.",32,0.986
1017,16,11,5.0,"After my first visit to Ootoya in Union Square, I was a fan. Fish fish and more fish? YEAH. I came back with the same dining companions this time -- and it's conveniently located near Bryant Park, my favorite of all NYC parks. At 5:10PM, a line was already forming. Anticipation built as 5:30 approached. We were in. This time, we sat at the bar, a unique experience that I prefer over a table. Of course, more than three people and you might want to be able to talk to each other. But who needs to talk when your face is buried deep in such delightful dishes? They're known for their mackerel, but we've been there, done that. - Mini soba is tiny ($15) but it's one of the best things on the menu. Why? SOY SAUCE GELEE. I couldn't believe what was happening in my mouth. - Kaisen Don -- it's basically chirashi on STEROIDS. All I really cared about was the uni, and they gave me three huge pieces. Salmon, fatty tuna, scallop, yellowtail were the other main characters. For a set, which includes an egg custard and miso soup, it'll cost you $31. - Pressed Salmon - 3 styles of perfectly cut salmon, 6 total pieces. I would like two orders of that... everyday...- Yakitori - amazing, pricey but tasty. You pretty much can't go wrong with anything on the menu.",21,0.9919

It is exactly as I remembered it. I would frequent this place in Madrid at least once a day for a quick lunch. First off, have you seen their prices? Their mini sandwiches range from $1-$2.50. The specialty ones for $2.50 are def my go-to. You will more than likely feel overwhelmed with 100 to choose from (hence the name). Please note- I recently returned and they no longer have happy hour deals and Wednesday specials are very limited to a few items. I should've deducted a star for inconsistency bc they also removed my favorite Montadito off the menu but the place is still awesome and the quality of the meat is excellent.",23,0.944
1019,46,39,5.0,"Highlander - there can be only one!As I trekked through the highlands of Scotland by way of NYC, weary and parched from our epic journey, we saw in the distance a beacon of comfort and safety. Slowly we walked up to the unassuming front entrance and pushed through the barrier door - lo and behold, tis be a fine drinking establishment indeed!Manly dark wooden accents, dim lighting, stained glass, long bar, hidden seating in the back, ancient paintings on the walls, warm cozy fireplace with cushy leather chairs to sit in and converse over many brews. A place that Scottish warriors and noblemen alike would be proud to call their own. Shoolbred's in NYC is the motherland for these fine people.The barkeep was a fine gentleman who handed us the menu and was very welcoming. We had told him of our journey to this far neatherland and he was more then willing to tell us of the special secret of the day. Something called ""happy hour"" that afforded us a wooden trinket to be handed in for another brew. My God, what kind of magic was this? We were taken in by it's spell. We chose an ale called Rare Voss made in some country called Ommegang, and a potion of Hot Mulled Cider that the barkeep whipped up as his specialty. Both were exceptional and worthy of a second round which we drank heartily. Methinks a return trip to this land should be planned to take in a hot toddy or two.Yet, we needed some food sustenance after a long day. Perusing the menu there caught my eye a perfect choice - french fries with malt vinegar. These fine spuds were served to us cooked dark, thick, and with a fresh potato flavor. Drenching them in malt vinegar only enhanced the experience more. Our thirst and hunger were quenched.I also gleaned over a dutiful selection of scotch and whiskeys behind the bar. Mighty tempting, but that be for another time....On this day we had arrived late in the afternoon, as it seemed the sun was just over the horizon at about 4:30 or so. Night was falling. Just a few local townsfolk and fellow travelers were inside resting their feet and bellying up to the bar. The sounds of music were at a soft level and conversation was easy. Yes, tis a fine establishment indeed laddies and lassies. I would recommend this a destination for anyone looking to replentish their souls for a wee bit.Our minds were now at ease, and we made on our merry way to further adventures.",47,0.9895
1020,19,10,5.0,"4.5 Stars (for now)Since yelp has already broken up the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway (NYC Greenway Path) and reviewed the Hudson River portion, I felt it only fair someone should finally recognize the apparent black sheep of that family...Sure the paths themselves on the East River side aren't as well maintained, nor in nearly as good shape (be careful biking at night).Sure it isn't continuous; it won't take you from Battery Park, all the way up the eastern shoreline to Inwood.Sure it's under construction in many places- But hey, at least it's under construction.So yeah, I guess that makes it the 2nd Avenue Subway line of bike paths- but, it's a start. Until they can get the full funding, and figure out how to move some United Nations offices, we're stuck with what we got. I've seen projections that say most of the Greenway could be completed by 2015, and others that say it won't be fully completed until closer to 2020. Until then, take advantage of what we have.I personally prefer the East River portion of the Greenway, as you get to see much more of NYC (as opposed to NJ, from the Hudson River side). I also prefer it because it's much less traversed, so you can enjoy that scenery without being overly preoccupied looking out for pedestrians, bladers, runners, unattended children, and so on...You get a great view of the Statue of Liberty and Verrazano-Narrows Bridge as you round the bottom of the island and on around passed the Staten Island Ferry (where there's a Citi bike kiosk)- there is still ongoing construction to this area (due to Sandy), so keep your eyes pealed for detours. From there you can see Brooklyn across the river as you ride north passed the South Street Seaport. Then you get to ride under the Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Williamsburg bridges as you continue uptown. There are dozens of great spots to pull over and take in the beauty of the city along this path; I personally enjoy hanging under the Brooklyn Bridge on one of the benches.As you're nearing the Williamsburg bridge, you will be riding adjacent to East River Park (an oft overlooked gem of the NYC parks department) from here, if you want to get off the greenway, you can take the footbridge over the FDR at Delancey st/Williamsburg Bridge. Otherwise, you can keep riding uptown, where the path narrows into a bottleneck around the Con Ed plant at 15th st. In another 15 blocks, you'll pass the Water Club (signs say to walk bike, no one does). From here, it isn't too much further until the greenway breaks off at 37th st (another Citi bike kiosk) and you must ride over to the 1st avenue bike lane if you wish to continue uptown. At 54th street you can cut back east, towards the river, until you get to Sutton Place. Take Sutton north to 63rd street where you can once again connect with the East River Greenway (Bikeway). Then you can continue on the path for another 60 blocks before you once again have to detour back into the city.I know we all want our Big Apple Pie and eat it too, but until then- let's be happy with what we've got. The East River Greenway is a wonderful, under-appreciated pathway for us to enjoy. So do just that- enjoy.",20,0.9956

Although the crowd can be a little older here and somewhat aggressive, don't let that deter you because it's still a really great spot to come drink, and dance. I'll admit it's weird that a few times someone tried to grab my hand... but I'm gonna let it slide lol.The music here is pretty decent although it is about the same every weekend. You can definitely expect to hear certain songs if you're here regularly enough. PS 450 is chill, and if you're hungry, the nachos are AMAZING and they come in huge portions. At the bar, the bartenders are pretty easy to flag down, and they're so nice! They're also not cheap with the liquor so you don't feel like your wallet got ripped off when you come here.

They have cheap lingerie here in pretty much any style your dirty mind can imagine. As others have said, not a place to get classy La Perla-esqe stuff.

1025,16,11,5.0,"If there were to be a french fry Heaven on Earth, this is it. Forget the calories, it's all right to indulge in some guilty pleasures once in awhile. For one, Poutine may be one of them. Until only recently did I discover the Poutine at Pommes Frites, and damn, that is one unhealthy, but freaking delicious 'snack'. Pommes Fries is the Manhattan institution of Belgian style fries, perfectly double cooked Belgian style fries, which can be accompanied by several different flavored dips. You can order them regular, large, or double ranging from about $5 - $8, relatively inexpensive I'd say. Get the combo sauce deal for $4 to try 3 sauces (or $1.50 per dip). They have your basic condiments plus a variety of mayo based flavored dips. You're going to want to try more than one dip though, and you'll want to try something more than just ordinary ketchup. First time, I tried the smoked eggplant, horseradish, and dill lemon mayo. No surprise, horseradish was my favorite. Midway torwards the end though, you may not be able to differentiate between the dips because, trust me, you'll be nomming away on those fries. French fry grease all over fingers and mouth and such. The fries alone aren't too salty, if at all. You can really taste the quality of their potatoes, and it's not just grease and salt. Their potatoes are not the type you just buy from Shop Rite either. Going back on POUTINE (and I capitalize it because I must emphasize it), let me emphasize that it's super unhealthy, but it's one of those unhealthy pleasures that you must indulge in, at least once in your life, or at least the first or second time you're at Pommes. Especially for someone who's never had Poutine in their life, prepare to have your mind blown. I never had it before, and the first time I had it at Pommes, I understood why everyone loves Pommes. Yes, it's that good. Cheesy cheese curd melted atop warm gravy, warm gravy and cheesy cheese curd melted atop Belgian style fries. Yes, there is a french fry Heaven on Earth, and Pommes is it. Nothing to be surprised about, but it's always busy up in this place. I've been lucky enough to get a seat the past few times because most customers will give up waiting for one the moment they walk in. Pommes is a very very tiny place, and it's certainly not about ambiance. I'm not really surprised why Pommes keeps their shop so small though, and I think it's a pretty smart business move on their part. A true hole in the wall joint, and if you're okay with the shabby appearance and lack of seating (but at least they got music in the background), then call this the perfect place to eat at any time of the day, but for myself, it's perfect for a late night snack (sober or not).",18,0.9969

The store is virtually packed floor-to-ceiling with lots of candy including the more common gummies and other ""by-the-pound"" stuff, but also some impressive imported things that I didn't think I could find in New York. I spotted about ten types of Scandinavian licorice including salt licorice (which I love, and is an acquired taste for sure), Turkish delight, a variety of French and Italian chocolates, and the largest variety of (German) Ritter Sport bars I have seen in any store, including places in Europe. My head was spinning, and not from the sugar rush! The prices are literally unbeatable ($4 per pound for Haribo gummies is a steal when they are usually 4x that here in NYC), and it's just a dizzying, fun place to check out.

I've made a couple of friends through this church since I went to the Apostlist (young adult group) events. The 5:15 mass is the young adult mass so it's very inspiring to see people my age take the time to go here in the evening. This church is also more on the liberal side so they have a GLBT group, and they try to address any controversy happening in the Catholic community.

I have been wanting to come to this studio for a few years now but always found some other distraction. But this past week, I finally made it in. For the month of December 2013, B&P is giving away 3 FREE classes, just like that. Now, if you come here just to take a class, it is $40 a piece. So, you see why I made beeline for this place?Now, if you are a newbie, you have to take the Intro to Pole class. And they recommend you take a few intro classes before moving to Pole level 1. My instructor was Ros and she was absolutely amazing! She has so much energy and she is really good at instructing. Let me just say this, pole dancing class is NOT EASY. You have got to be strong, flexible and have tons of core strength. But with that said, I had a great time and I felt like I got a pretty good workout. The class is 90 minutes and the first 25 minutes of class is warming up, stretching and getting those muscles nice and pliable so you can do some amazing things with the pole. There is a technique to holding the pole, doing dips and swirling. All of them require proper form and correct use of your muscles. Ross was very good at explaining what you should be doing so that you don't injure yourself. The 90 minutes went by fast and it made want to take another class! So, with that said, I went back out into the lobby and asked to join the flexibility class that was about to start in 15 minutes. This class was also AMAZING! Helena was the instructor and she really took the time to help all of us thru splits and straddles. She was also a very good instructor. Making sure to teach you the proper FORM. There is really nothing worse than teaching a class without emphasizing form and which muscles groups you are using. They have a locker room with ample locker space, and a well lit dressing room mirror. Also a water cooler for your use. Upstairs, there are 2 bathrooms and an area to sit and lounge. They also sell B&P apparel, water bottles and journals. And also, if you don't get in here before the holiday deal is over, they have an intro class package for only $25 so you can give it a try.

Time to party once I get the feelings back in all of my toes and stop hobbling up and down the stairs!I just ran the ING NYC Marathon on Sunday and it was my very first marathon.Actually, it was my very first everything... I never ran an official 5K or 10K or half marathon before this whole process. Ever. Yeah, I kind of woke up one day and randomly decided to sign up for this and do it because I didn't feel challenged enough in my own life... I must be crazy. I trained for 4 months in hot and freezing cold weather with my charity Team for Kids. In the middle of training I discovered I had leg problems I didn't even know you could have and had to have physical therapy. The end result? I went from being someone who never ran more than 3-5 miles at one time in her life to finishing a 26.2 mile run in just under 5 hours.I... still can't believe I did this. Never in my life did I think I could do a marathon. Just goes to show you that you can always surprise yourself and prove yourself wrong. The NYC Marathon itself is one of the most amazing and rewarding experiences one can have. From the start at the Verrazano Bridge in Staten Island to the very end in Central Park, you and 50,000+ runners all have the same goal- cross the damn finish line no matter what. Throughout the difficult course, everyone is rallying you on because they want you to succeed. It's such an amazing thing, knowing that.You'll never forget the bands on 4th Avenue, the gruesome uphill battle on the infamous 59th Street bridge, the roaring crowds on 1st, the amazing choirs in Harlem, the Japanese drums in the Bronx, the insuppressible energy of those around you cheering you on when you've obviously hit the ""wall"" and the feeling that radiates throughout your entire body once you've crossed that line. I think I can honestly say that my life will never be the same. Even if I never run another 26.2 miles, I am now and will always be a marathoner.",50,0.9704

Bottles of wine can be purchased for under $40 (I am a fan!) and the atmosphere is both welcoming and sophisticated. Chef Hong has also worked in Kittichai, JG's Spice Market, and JG's Perry Street. The name itself means ""beautiful"" and Ngam encompasses just that in every aspect. Perhaps the best part about this place? It's locally sourced and seasonal. Following all the yelp reviews we started with the Chiang Mai Fries, composed of pumpkin and sweat potato and served with both a red curry mayo and a sweet and sour peanut relish. They were crispy and delicious, however things only went up from there. Next we tried the ""Por Pia"" shitake mushroom spring rolls. Wow! These were amazeballs and the mushrooms were so unbelievably fresh. Then came the real star of the evening, and a surprising one at that: Authentic Old School Pad Thai. Yes, the pad thai! Now I know you're reading this thinking ""really? Pad Thai? Of all the things you could have ordered Lissa? I can get Pad Thai anywhere."" I'm here to tell you this aint just anywhere my friends. This is the home of the most mouth watering, food orgasmic Pad Thai I've ever tasted. Yep. I said it. Done and done. Even before I could finish my first bite I literally moaned out loud ""Ohhhhh myyyyyy gooooodddddd"" it was just that good. It's got the traditional Pad Thai vibe going that we all know and love but this wonderful charred flavor from Ngam's open kitchen. It's so good in fact that we finished every last bite and at one point I think I heard my girl say that perhaps we needed another order. They also do a Zucchini and a Papaya Pad Thai, which I would be curious to try but would order in addition to the authentic. We also tried the Kale fried rice but that didn't blow me away. So yea... in summary I am a fan! I will be back. I'm already craving Ngam again less than 24 hours later.",19,0.9919
1035,7,7,5.0,"Having recently moved into the city, my goal is to have one All-Star restaurant for every different cuisine (Yelpers, as soon as my collection is extensive, I'll turn it into a list!). I've already got my Israeli and Mexican places; this may as well be my Spanish go-to.Casa Pomona offers an amazing selection of authentic Spanish tapas, with a handful of innovative additions. The decor is beautiful, very emblematic of restaurants in Madrid. This is THE places to go ""tapear"" (Verb: try different arrays of tapas, to obtain a diverse culinary experience, and to shun the individuals who suggests everyone order their own main course). I came across this place through Blackboard Eats, a site that emails out new restaurants offering discounts; I took advantage of the 30% off deal to try out Casa Pomona. As for the individual tapas, here's what I thought. Patatas bravas: best fried potatoes I've ever had; crispy perfection, topped with a sublime tomato-paprika sauce. Cochinillo: pork skin wasn't entirely crispy, but it was juicy and flavorful. Cheese sampling: let the chef decide for you, he knows best! Albondigas: mama mia what an amazing meatball. Only two downsides: the sangria was nothing to write home about, and the service was slow (took a while to pay for the check, servers weren't super friendly). However, we had a large pitcher of water (steady access to water is important for me while eating out), so they were pretty minor issues.",15,0.974

1037,13,11,5.0,"In all my years of eating ice cream and racking my brain around the ""who has the best ice cream??"" debate, I'm finally willing to admit my (and many others) mistake for stubbornly getting lost hating on certain stores and all 50 flavors they serve just because we didn't like the two that we had that day.For instance, Sundaes & Cones is one of those risk-taking parlors. Sure, they have the classic chocolate and vanilla which are pretty solid. But if you have never tasted or do not like wasabi, ginger, or black sesame (in their actual forms), you probably won't be happy with those particular ice cream flavors that your asian friend recommended because he/she was trying to be exotic and demonstrate asian-pride. The fact that they can draw out those particular flavors into their ice cream is definitely impressive to me but I personally think those three flavors are absolutely disgusting. Well, the black sesame is ooooookay but it's still way too strong, in my opinion. So why 5 stars?? Because they have three flavors which, for my particular palate, are three of the most amazing scoops of ice cream I've had, one of which I would venture to say is the best scoop I've had in New York. Pistachio-Almond: Most would say if you want a good scoop of pistachio, you're better off going for some gelato, which I would completely agree with. However, for ice cream, this is really damn good. Bring in a scoop of pistachio gelato and have a scoop of their pistachio-almond and you'll taste the difference. It might not be as rich as gelato but the almonds definitely add a layer of flavor that is unique and works really well with the pistachio.Taro: For starters, the best scoop of taro that I've personally had is at Chinatown Ice Cream Factory (CICF). But Sundaes & Cones comes out in a close second and really, it all comes down to preference. The taro at Sundaes & Cones doesn't have the grainy texture but instead, is more smooth and easier for people who may be trying it for the first time. Granted, I think some of the flavor is lost relative to CICF but when it comes down to it, there is still plenty of taro flavor and for many people I've taken, they've been immensely satisfied having never had taro. Hazelnut: One word: Fragrant. If you want to experience what I think is the best scoop of ice cream I've had so far in NY, go get some hazelnut from Sundaes & Cones and judge for yourself. It's. Fucking. Delicious.oh yeah, the prices aren't too bad either :)",16,0.9974

CANDLES! yes, there are tiny candles at each table. shut up. i dunno . . . there's just something beautiful about a cute coffee shop, candlelit at night, great music playing. ya see . . . i'd rather fall in love with someone at a coffee shop (or library) than at some random bar. shrug.i didn't use the Internet (strictly a reading and writing sort of night), so i can't attest to how good or bad it is.regardless, i plan on being a frequent customer here. and i'm hoping i get better service next time i visit. not that service was terrible - i'm being picky here. but, it seems rather rude to ignore a customer for almost 3 minutes, especially when the place isn't packed. but, i'll give them the benefit of the doubt.",11,0.9979

All the way to Chinatown with its nondescript storefront. First off, I didn't know what to choose. All the sandwiches sounded great. But as I usually do, I hadn't eaten all day, so I needed something beefy. Braised Short Rib, spicy horseradish sauce, arugula, cherry tomatoes, on buttered & toasted challah bread. AWWWW SOOKIE! Guy behind the counter asked me if I was from New Orleans. For a second, I thought I was. That sandwich almost had me speaking in tongues. Of course I couldn't leave without trying the Chicken Biscuit. That I took to-go with an order of Ben-Yays... the teeny tiny babies of beignets. Okay, I'm going to be honest even though it'll make me look like a complete pig. That Chicken Biscuit didn't even make it home. So good. Spicy, perfectly deep fried chicken breast with crispy slaw. *Groan* Good food is always accompanied by sex noises. The location is out of the way and there isn't much desirable seating (oh there are benches aplenty, but more decorative than useful). But I will make the effort to return.

Seriously, Yelp friends? Where were you on this??The service was just as good as the food. One girl had this entire place under control. She brought waters without being asked. She handed out smiles and cheerful greetings like it was her job. Better still, like it wasn't her job, but like she really meant it. All the while, handling takeout and seamless orders.On to the food. I had the small macaroni and cheese ($5.50) and the Cowboy Hero ($6.50). The hero was soy pepper steak, tomatoes, pickled cucumbers, mixed greens and tapioca cheese smothered in a spicy chipotle sauce. I only got through about half of the sandwich before the vegan Mac and cheese came out. More of a buttery flavor than a cheesy one, it had flavorful crumbles that made it absolutely addictive.  It was way too much food for just me, but for that price.. Who cares?!?I just wish that I lived closer. I'm in love with Loving Hut. Think they'll deliver to Brooklyn?",14,0.9922

1042,8,10,5.0,"Have you been to MoMA PS1? Welcome to Preserve24. Except it doesn't have little plaques on the walls explaining that over 200 artists have collaborated to bring you a bar/restaurant with two floors of unique installations that appear (to the unknowing eye) to be common pieces of reclaimed wood and metal arranged together in uncommon ways.Do you see that giant two-level cage that is visible on both floors? Yes. It looks like it's for a go-go dancer. It's not. It's eventually going to be a freezer/sculpture with an iceberg in it that will be carved out of a glacier by hand in Greenland and then shipped on a boat to our very own Lower East Side. I don't know how they are going to accomplish this and I don't know when but I do know that it's a pretty f'ing novel idea. It's a large restaurant- perfect for big group brunches with people that like well prepared food and drinks. There is a bar on the top floor and another one on the lower level. On the top floor in the back you will see a long 10 person table separated from the rest of the restaurant and elevated slightly- my best friend, a princess with a Y chromosome whose 6th sense is Chanel, decided in 2.5 seconds that he wanted his birthday dinner to be in that very spot. We met some of the door staff and the event planner and the general manager- they are all very hospitable, they are all very handsome, they all genuinely care about and take pride in their restaurant.

1043,8,6,5.0,"Elsa is pretty much the only reason that you'll find me in Alphabet City. It's incredibly out of the way, far from the subway station, and getting here means you have to traverse East Village. Nonetheless, this place is quite an amazing bar, with great atmosphere, and equally great drinks. Elsa isn't a large cocktail bar by any means. However, I've never had trouble getting a table, and maneuvering throughout this establishment. Elsa's atmosphere is pretty laid back. Sure it can get a little noisy at times, but it's not to an unbearable level like at McSorley's. When you walk in, you're greeted with the bar on the right hand side. There are bar stools if you want to drink at the bar, but for those who want to sit down, there are tables galore. Even on a Friday night around midnight, the longest I've had to wait for a table was roughly around 20 minutes. Not too shabby at all. The lighting here is dim, which give it that slightly intimate feel. The noise level does throw it off a little bit, but it's still a pretty laid place to sit down, have a conversation, and drink in the process. If you're looking to get away from the typical East Village crowd, then you'll catch a break at Elsa. Sure, everyone's in the late-20s and early 30-s but you won't be seeing guys throw back shots of Jameson or doing Irish car bombs. Drink-wise, I've always gone with either the Manhattan or Old Fashioned. These drinks are made to precision, and thankfully, are nice and strong. The prices are pretty normal for cocktails, and thank god this place takes credit cards. In the end, if you're looking for a place to grab some nice drinks and actually not have to shout to have a conversation, then Elsa can be your spot. The staff is laid back, drinks are good, and the prices aren't going to break your bank.",9,0.996
1044,11,10,5.0,"You walk through the dark alleys of Chinatown and you can find anything. And this bar is no exception. It is nestled in the corner of a dark and grimy alleyway next to a basement Mexican restaurant. One would pay no heed to anything happening in this area of town.

You will notice a big brute at the entrance guarding the entrance like a mountain troll guarding it's treasure. Speak the password, and entry is given. (password for Oct is Fitzgerald). ""Step inside"" he says. And the curtains unveil a dimly lit and raucous bar filled with people enjoying their drinks and comfortably sitting on the velvet sofas.

Weak drinkers can ask the mixologist for a custom drink that wont be as stiff. But for the initiated. Go for any of the drinks that contain absinthe. The Bohemian Fizz is one such drink. And this is one of my favorite drinks. It's nice and stiff. Gives you a quick buzz right away. Be careful though. Too many and you might be floored by the end of the night.

1045,6,4,5.0,"Wow, this place is a godsend to me! I've been here twice, with guests visiting NYC and walking all over town in this humid heat, so foot massages were much, much needed! After doing a little research on my trusty Yelp app, I narrowed it down to just a few places. I don't honestly know if I'll make it to the other spots, b/c Yan Mei hit THE spot really well.First off, the service is pretty good. The host guy is very kind and accommodating, and the masseuse, though not all of them can speak English really well, are also kind and try their best to make it comfortable for you. This place is clean, hygienic, and has a pleasant smell. I have walked in, and called in advance, and either times I did not have to wait very long, that or I would just take a walk and come back - they will take your phone number and call you.What Yan Mei is not though, is totally quiet and tranquil - it can be a bit noisy - white noise. There's outside traffic for one, but also idle chatter amongst people in the back rooms and the lobby, and occasionally a masseuse will let their timer beep off for minutes on end. If you're really paying attention, you'll hear other guests grunting, and bodies being pushed up against, and hands on clothing with pressure, etc. Now, normally all of this could/would/should bother me, but the massage is so good that it's not hard for me to zone out and drown out that white noise. While they do manage to keep it quiet and relaxing most of the time, the slightly buzzing ambience might not be for the sensitive types; a warning for light sleepers, etc.Despite the white noise, the massages are great because they are efficient in pinpointing what areas of your back, neck, shoulders, and feet that really need help. They use an adamant amount of pressure, and you will feel the pain depending on how messed up your muscles are (especially if you're like me, and sit at a computer all day). But it's worth it to me, to get these knots ironed out, and they do it in a way that it's not excruciating for too long, after a while they get them out! Afterwards, I always feel refreshed, relaxed, and muscles looser, which is a great feeling.Like others say, this is a no-frills place, and it's cash only I believe. It's a clean place for Chinatown, small and simple. Sometimes the masseuse will use paper towels to massage your neck/back, but my guy was so graceful doing it the first time that I didn't even notice/care/mind. If you decide to go with the ""A"" option, which is a whole hour for $30 (which I 100% recommend!), they start off by having you soak your feet in hot water, while your back is facing them and they start with your neck, back, and shoulders. After 20 minutes, they turn you around and seat you in the chair, where they spend 40 minutes on your feet - 20 min on each foot. For the price, this is simply a great deal.The only thing I regret is not tipping my guy more. All I had left was exactly 20% in tips but I felt he deserved way more than that. He took his time, even though he was the last guy left and the place was beyond closing. I'll be back again soon though!",15,0.9949

My friend and I split a nice bottle of wine and it was decanted in the craziest decanter I've seen. We decided to split the 16 oz filet which was more than enough meat for both of us. The steak was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. We also shared three sides- creamy mashed potatoes with garlic, brussel sprouts with parmesean and mixed mushrooms. The sides all complimented the steak beautifully. They gave us a complimentary mushroom ravioli appetizer which was a nice touch.

Paint Along provides plastic cups and bottle openers!The instructor broke down steps in an easy-to-understand manner: she gave very good tips on spacing and shape-making, showed us how to mix paints accurately, painted an example painting for us, and made it clear that we could customize our paintings to our liking. She was very patient and a good multi-tasker, especially because she had to juggle teaching us, refilling paints, and helping those who needed a lending hand (guilty as charged).

1056,3,0,5.0,"The best car service in the city. $40 flat rate to/from JFK, $30 to/from LGA via East Village.How I came to find Quick Ride was a little like the story of Goldilocks & the three bears. I tried other methods of transportation to and from the airports around NYC, from Uber, to Carmel, Super Shuttle, and some other rando car services I can't even name...I was never satisfied. Either the rates were too high, the time it took to get me places took too long, they were LATE with pickups, or the automobile I was in reeked of cigarettes & B.O. (All true stories, by the way.)Then I found Quick Ride through this trusty website and haven't looked back since.For starters, I don't care that they don't have a website. They don't need one because whatever they're doing works. If you hate talking to people on the phone, there's really nothing to worry about. Whoever is on the other line at Quick Ride is literally 'quick' at taking down your pickup or drop off info and locking it in the system. I ALWAYS get picked up on time (or even earlier for that matter) and have never been late to the airport coming from my apartment in the East Village - which takes about 45-1 hour at most. They've also been consistent with airport pickups, and if anything are just 10 minutes behind schedule, which I don't mind.Friendly drivers who respect your privacy and never talk too much, always a plus in my book.",16,0.8787
1057,4,1,5.0,"When you come here, I think there are a couple things that you have to take for granted: you're going to spend a lot of money, and there is no way you're going to spend an amount that feels a bit high. At least that was my reaction once we got seated in ZZ's, which has a very speakeasy feel to it. You have 9 seats at 4 tables, and another 4 seats along the wall - and that's it. I'm pretty sure a reservation is required regardless of how many people are inside, just given the fact that you have a guy wearing a suit standing in front of the door with (what I presume is) a list of names and spots available - so don't plan on wandering through Greenwich Village to end up here. The service is quick and pretty simple; there are a couple of waiters who bring your dishes as they are prepared. You have music playing at a decent volume in the background, though, so this doesn't come off as a true speakeasy - there were times when I felt the volume the 8 or so of us were generating is more than would be tolerated at a place that really keeps an ear out for the volume.ZZ's, although it calls itself a clam bar, is really more generally focused on seafood - only a few of the menu items are clams (or clam-based). It also focuses on the cocktails, all of which (at least according to the waitress) are original concoctions. The vast majority are based on fruit flavors, and the two that we had (Mango and Strawberry) were delicious. In particular, the mango flavor blended seamlessly with the bourbon to create a drink with a little bite, but not overwhelmingly so, and the giant ice cube that sits in the middle helps to temper the drink as it melts. The strawberry is also really good, with the light flavor of the berry providing a gentle overtone to whatever alcohol was used as the base (I forget what it was), with an herbed finish.The real star, though, has to be the food. I think it's pretty easy to blanche on first glance at the menu - every single menu item is over $15, with some running as high as $100(!) - very expensive, considering that everything here is pretty much an appetizer-style dish, not an entree. If you want to stick with oysters and clams, those are pretty standard price ($3 a pop or so, on average). Before we ordered, we were served an amuse bouche of clam flatbread, which was just so damn phenomenal we asked the waitress if there was any way we could order it (it's not on the menu, and the answer was no - apparently everyone asks). I usually like my flatbreads relatively plain, but the clam had an interesting smoky flavor, and the amount of cheese was just right - creating a bite that makes you wonder how you can get more. Of the other dishes we ordered, I would absolutely recommend two the ones we had: the tuna carpaccio and the cherry trout crudo. I'd love to try the other carpaccio some time (that one comes with beef and caviar), but the tuna is breathtakingly delicious. You have a circle of fresh tuna that's been pounded into thin slices, covered in foie gras and bone marrow and topped off some chives. It is so good - the double whammy of fatty goodness that the foie and marrow provide brings out the richness of the tuna flavor. Plop it on a piece of toasted brioche toast that comes with it, and you have a dish that will make you nearly forget about the rest of the meal. The cherry trout is served up with trout roe and fried leeks. The trout itself is absolutely delicious - very good flavor - but the roe helps provide dashes of saltiness that helps enhance the dish. The leeks also add additional texture and a dash of greasiness that works really well. The golden eye snapper is not as succulent, but the firmness of the fish is a nice change of texture, and it pairs really well with the strawberry (I think?) garnish on top. The uni toast is decadent, as anything with uni should be; I liked the pretzel bread that was used - gives it a bit of an NY feel to the dish. The seared scallop was really good as well - the scallops is sliced up thinly in the shell, but compared to the other dishes, it doesn't quite stand out as much. The oysters (we got 2 of everything) were very good. All are East Coast, so don't expect anything too sweet, but the oysters from freshwater rivers were very interesting - a much more neutral taste than those that came from elsewhere. We finished the meal with key lime pie - a bit overpriced at $15, but immaculately prepared. With a firm crust on bottom, a key lime filling that bites with pinches of sweet tartness, and what looks like a slightly baked meringue on top, it's a classy - and delicious - way of finishing off a phenomenal meal.Yes, this place is expensive - so don't come here if you don't want to overspend a little. But the originality of the place, the decor, and the high quality of the dishes served, makes this a place not to be missed. It's not anything like an Upstate, where the focus is on the mollusks - but it's a spectacular experience in its own right.",16,0.9993

1059,13,13,5.0,"This place is amazing. Think Texas bbq meets a burrito. Maybe I just ordered the exact right thing. I've been know to do that. Got a burrito w half brisket half antelope (smoked antelope was their special of the week). Both were awesome with a nice smoked flavor - the antelope reigned supreme - I think the other ""stuff"" like jalapeños and tomato baste it was sitting in added so much flavor. There does end up being a lot going in with the burrito once u soup it up, but that's your choice. I'd recommend the guacamole, corn (and perhaps squash) add-on for a dollar. Plus some cheese. Cost me 11.50 but I got way more meat than at a chipotle and it tasted way better and something unique.A few operational suggestions for management:* your water dispenser is very slow - perhaps this is deliberate to steer patrons towards soda etc. If so, that's genius* the wrapper on burrito is put on inside out - i believe the foil should be on the outside, and the paper should be on the inside. And now you owe me a free burrito.",14,0.9694
1060,15,11,5.0,"We wanted our first day as a married couple to be special, so instead of flying to Tokyo for sushi, we made a reservation at Sushi Nakazawa. The reservation system is a bit elusive, with only 10 bar seats-- more likely than not you will be sitting at a table out of sight of the famed Jiro Ono apprentice. We got lucky though and got to sit right in front! =)The atmosphere is inviting. There was classical music playing in the background (albeit a little loud), modern decor with a granite counter top, even the swivel bar stools had leather arms and a back. The spacing between diners was great--- hands down the most comfortable sushi bar experience I've ever had.Nakazawa-san is in a league of his own. He has this magnetic personality that you would not expect from a high end sushi chef. Most NYC sushi chefs are grumpy-- I don't mind since I respect their craft and their food-- but Nakazawa-san's laugh is intoxicating and he has a really good sense of humor. His English is also surprisingly good. I'm not sure if its a result of his time spent in Seattle but we were able to have a coherent conversation and you could tell he was enjoying the interaction and not annoyed by it. Love it.There is no menu. It's $150/pp Omakase all the way. There is a long drink menu but I recommend just going with the $40 sake pairing. You get 6 glasses of sake with 12? (I lost count because I ended up ordering 5 or 6 pieces on top) pieces of Nigiri and a Toro handroll for $190 before tax/tip. Each additional piece of Nigiri cost about $8/piece. Expected, so no sticker shock here. The Sushi is great! I've written so much about the experience it's hard not to write about the Sushi. I started out with two pieces of Alaskan Wild Salmon, One smoked one not smoked. I was expecting these a little further down the line with the usual white fish first but it made no difference. You'll notice that he chooses quite a few Northwest fish for his lineup. WA Geoduck, Alaskan King Salmon, etc. Then came the Chard, Mackarel, Hamachi, etc etc etc. The pieces that really stand out are the smoked and pickled pieces. It's all technique here fellas-- the flavors and textures are complex so you'll end up sitting there trying to compare it to something you've had before. I couldn't put my finger on some of them and I just love that feeling of experiencing something new.  The scallop is such a crowd pleaser-- a little sea salt on top, some citrus and a little poof in your face jalapeno burn with the delicate crunch of fresh scallop. yum yum. The toro, uni is what you expect-- ridiculously good although he does not crack the uni open from the shell anymore. The meal was perfect. I even bumped into Alex, the owner on our way out. He was personable and took a picture for us outside the restaurant. If you can swing it-- I highly recommend you give Nakazawa a try!",29,0.9953

The whole dumplings consist of higher quality ingredients. It's competitor, more popular, is Joes Shanghai. Joes is very good as well and vastly famous for their soup dumplings; but I'm confident to say Shanghai Café has better soup dumplings. They dumplings are more flavorful.

Also, when you put your phone down to dig your wallet out of your bag & subsequently leave it there, she will notice. She will hold onto it for you. She will call your dad & explain that his daughter left her phone at the Visitor's Center on Roosevelt Island (like a moron).When you sheepishly come back for your phone, she will say ""I called your dad, I hope that's okay"".

That's saying a lot because I DO NOT drink soda-- carbonation bugs my nose. I'd recommend the blueberry soda. 3 out of 4 times I am here, my boyfriend and I get a third roll to split because it is so darn delicious. This is also probably the only restaurant we don't really speak at while eating because we're relishing in the deliciousness of our food so much. I wish I was joking. If you don't want chips and the soda, the roll itself will cost you $15. They also offer shrimp rolls, crab rolls, grilled cheese, and they have great soup. TIP: The ceramic lobster claws on the tables are filled with old bay seasoning (I believe that's what it is called). If you don't see any claws ask the guy behind the counter for it.

1066,22,18,5.0,"Piora is the brain child of Chef Chris Cipollone and restaurateur Simon Kim (formerly of the Tenpenny and the Mark, respectively). Since its opening just 11 days ago, it has already stirred up quite a buzz in town. I'm shocked that no one on Yelp has reviewed Piora yet!Piora is Korean for ""blossom,"" as evidenced by the gorgeous flower mural on the wall by Stephanie Goto (of Aldea and Corton). [When I mentioned how gorgeous the space was, our server immediately began to gush about Ms. Goto. You trained them well, Piora, love it!] Also, most of the food served is Italian with French and Korean influences - interesting!Greeted by the cheerful hostess, we were led past ""the Foyer"" (bar area) to an intermediate space with only three stool-seating tables. The glass panels enclosing the space provided a more private, intimate environment compared to the open, main dining area in the back. There's also a lush, outdoor garden patio that our server, Joe, assured us will be opened soon.Their menu is divided into six sections in the hopes that you'll order a dish from each. Between the two of us, we only ordered four dishes (not including dessert) to share, so for the average two persons, five to six plates should be reasonable.The amuse bouche of watermelon with mint and pistachio was the first to the table. It was very simple, and there was no cohesion between the ingredients. But the watermelon was perfectly ripe and crispy and the mint was fresh.The six pieces of monkey bread sat snugly in a scalding, black, rectangular skillet. Each piece fit comfortably in the palm of your hand. The bread was not the least bit gooey or overly sweet; it was light and fluffy with a hint of butter, topped with a thin layer of salt. The bread also came with seaweed butter and whipped lardo, presented on unwieldy marble coasters. By itself or slathered on the bread, they were both incredibly delicious.The scallops with sweet corn, chanterelle, and crispy chicken skin was a creative, fancy twist to Southern comfort food. The scallops (two pieces) were cooked just right, with an even, charred layer. I was delighted that they used my favorite part of chicken (crispy skin) to counterbalance the soft corn kernels and creamy corn puree.I have no words for the rigatoni with red wine, duck sausage, spigarello, and charred fig, except that you MUST get it. Each bite contained bursts of flavor from the fragrant fennel in the duck sausage (reminiscent of star anise in Taiwanese braised pork on rice, or lu rou fan), the full-bodied red wine, and sweet fig. The complexity of this dish was outstanding!In the ocean trout with cauliflower, pear, and nduja dish, Chef Cipollone let the perfectly cooked ocean trout speak for itself. It was moist and flakey, where the sweetness of the pear quietly enhanced the flavor of the trout. But it was the plating of the dish that impressed me. If you look carefully, it appears to be an aerial view of the bottom of a lake with a large rock, drifting seaweed, and small pebbles. Absolutely stunning.While service was a bit shaky as the servers and bus boys were still grasping the ropes (Joe was lovely though!), they will surely learn quickly as Mr. Kim was personally checking in on each table the night we were there. The prices are on the higher end, but the food is absolutely worth it; it is such a rarity these days to find a restaurant in which every dish is thought-out carefully and executed flawlessly. Piora will be the next big restaurant and Cipollone/Kim is definitely a team you want to follow!---Notes:- We sadly had to skip dessert, but they have a peach shaved ice and strawberry shortcake with yuzu I definitely want to try.- The entire menu is posted on their website. The barbecued octopus in gochujang with basil, pine nuts, and red pepper flakes also sounded amazing - next time, for sure.",38,0.9944
1067,5,13,5.0,"So this was my first time back in about four years. I had one dinner here that I found oddly lacking for all of the hype that was swirling about. Fast forward, and I find myself with a group of friends who all rabidly want to try this place for the first time. Reluctantly I joined, or should I say, fortunately I gave it another shot.This time, I found the food to be much more focused. Numerous courses had flavors that were very sharp, unlike my prior muddled experience filled with bland or muddled dishes. Of course, they also included some of the classics like the smoked egg and the shaved foie gras. It's about 10 courses, and a pretty reasonable amount of food (though you might be a bit hungry afterwards if you are anything like me). On the plus side, unlike many of the other double digit tasting menus I have tried, they keep the dishes moving--since they do two seatings a night, we were in an out in exactly two hours (this might be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you want to get out of a tasting menu at this price point).The staff was super friendly and accommodating. I definitely plan on coming back much more frequently than my prior four year hiatus.PS: The highlight of the night had to be the 20-something girl walking in and asking for a takeout menu. When she was told it was strictly a reservation-only tasting menu kind of restaurant, she insisted that she would be fine with just taking out a few of the courses. Fortunately we were seated near the door and heard this whole exchange, so much laughter ensued.",8,0.9822

1069,12,51,5.0,"I was ready to try a new sauna/bath (one of my favorite things), and Juvenex was on the list. It is definitely pricier than the $35 Russian bathhouse, but you're getting a much bigger treatment package. For $115, you do their saunas (dry, steam, and soaking tub) plus a body scrub, hair wash, and facial. I phoned up a coworker, made our appointments and off we went!It took a while to find this place, but once you're inside, you feel like you've stepped to another world. Everything is warm and curvy and natural and lovely! The girl behind the counter was beyond nice. She showed us to the locker ""room"" (it's really just a general changing area with a half-wall) and was waiting with robes, towels, and cucumber water for us after we got in our suits.Speaking of suits, I think you can go in the buff during the day (women-only hours), but everyone was wearing a suit. First up, dry sauna: This was my favorite. Not the hottest I've ever been in, but way more zen! It was like a stone igloo. It was dark, and had an herbal scent. Lying on the bench, I felt like I was back in the womb!Next, soaking tub: Probably my least favorite. The water was an ok temperature, but I had thought it would be mega hot, like the osen tubs I've read about. This was like a tepid bath. There were lemons floating in the water, which was nice. On to the steam room: I liked this room. It was like a little greenhouse (without the plants). The ceiling was peaked, and the whole room was plastic, instead of marble. Very cool vibe. The heat was good too. Like the dry sauna, it had an herbal thing going on. The scent was nice; more noticeable in the wet heat. After about 15 minutes in each room, two ladies told us it was time for our scrub. We were brought into a side room, and realized we were going to get scrubbed together (same room, separate tables). So now I'm naked and hanging out with my naked coworker. Luckily, we're buddy buds, but if you want to do a spa day with your new mother-in-law, you might want to ask for separate rooms!We get on our tables, nude and giggling. I'm waiting for them to drape a towel over me, but it never happened. You are fully exposed the whole time. Then, I waited for them to get the body scrub mixture---usually a sugar or salt slurry. Nope. They use mega intense mitts. Commence scrubbing! This was not zen. It was militant! At one point my knees were over my ears while I was scrubbed in oh-so-unexpected places. Most hysterical part: We were turned on our sides, and I made a point of ensuring we were back to back. My logic was this way my coworker wouldn't have me staring at her ass. I did not consider that eventually we'd both be on our OTHER sides. Which meant we were now facing each other, naked and getting scrubbed, and trying not to crack up--especially when our legs were being lifted and stretched. While we were on the table, we also got our hair wash and facials. Both were kind of abrupt, but appreciated!So, I could see someone disliking this experience, bcs you're exposed and getting manhandled. But really, it was so insanely fun(ny) and my skin is so incredibly soft now. So I have to say it was 100% worth it!We got to relax in the sauna again after our treatment, and we were offered complimentary tea and fruit. I can't say it enough: the service was top notch. I would definitely recommend checking out Juvenex. Just be sure to get a good sense of what the treatments entail before you go!",44,0.9983

1072,15,12,5.0,"Having now been open for the greater part of seven years, I was worried that the Modern would lose its edge. After all, seeming the more avant-garde of the pair is difficult when the other half of said pair is the MoMA. Beyond that, high-end restaurants have a tendency to wheeze softly into complacency once they've achieved a sizable cadre of regulars. Look no further than the recent NY Times review of Daniel for proof of that. Finally, perhaps most troubling of all, was the sheer rate of expansion of the Union Square Hospitality Group empire, the full divestiture of Eleven Madison Park to Daniel Humm notwithstanding. Every great location closing carried with it the buzz that Danny Meyer was eyeing the space for an opening. Maintaining Michelin star standards at one restaurant while simultaneously pursuing the creation and development of others is no small feat. The odds then, were stacked.Upon entering the Bauhaus derived room, you will want to breathe easier, thinking that no space this meticulously, functionally, intuitively arranged would be dragged down by poorly executed dishes. Instead, you will feel a sharp intake of breath at the sheer height of the ceiling, the impossible openness, and the panoply of sculptures seemingly visible from every angle. It is as if Walter Gropius were teleported from 1920s Weimar to construct this utilitarian cathedral in the middle of Manhattan, then ordered to spruce it up with the tiniest hints of Expressionism he so secretly enjoyed. The food embraces this same enviable synthesis of form and function, in less obvious fashions. However, the obligatory test tube amuse aside, the food also manages to convey emotion through aesthetic, insofar as one is capable of following along, and insofar as one is open to the idea that the narrator is not telling the same tale to everyone. While the decor is sleek, obvious and immediate in its minimalist appeal, the food can be erudite, rewarding those who take the time to savor, thereby sussing out tiny flourishes that would be acutely imperceptible to the voracious. The Modern is not a place to be consumed in one desperate journey. Instead, like any great museum, it is a place predicated by and made more immersive through periodic, sustained reflection and at times, rumination.On first taste, the pitted raspberry seems to be an unrefined parlor trick. A tart fruit stuffed with something as rich as foie gras is hardly genius, given the utter propensity of renditions on offer in restaurants throughout the city, the lesser scale here simply a nuance. Then, the juniper coolis reaches your palate. Any sort of smug self-assurances about the course your meal was sure to take that you formulated mere moments ago fall by the wayside with the first hint of pine that juniper berries imbue. You move then to the ""Pralines"" of foie gras terrine, dubious in equal measure at the server's pronunciation ""pray-leen"" and the fact that the dish comes with a mango purée. You will then blithely forget your skepticism and spoon the long carpet of pureée from your plate, safe in the knowledge that your peers are too engrossed by their own plates to see and judge you accordingly. Your partner is too busy marveling over the gently roasted Royal Trumpet mushrooms, uncovering each Bouchot mussel with the reaction of a prospector finding a solid nugget of gold. You will wonder when the chef, Gabriel Kreuther, plans on showing his roots. Your wonder will cease when the ""Alsatian Dumplings"" arrive, and it will begin anew at the first taste of sunchoke and truffle melding with the delicate, gamey rabbit. M regretted ordering the Munster-Brie ""Soufflé"" in their place, though it too was greater than the sum of its parts. For the entrées to follow such thoughtful and composed appetizers, and to not only match but trump them speaks to a sort of culinary perfectionism that most restaurants only ever dream of achieving. Both the maple brined pork loin and its cracklin, and the beef tenderloin and the bone marrow it comes with, and their respective interspersion of accompaniments are all prepared so flawlessly that you will be forced to hypothesize why cuisine so irreproachably skillful merits but a sole Michelin star. You will reach no answers, but you will take comfort in knowing that in spite of how well it embodies its name, The Modern is timeless.",19,0.9641

I signed the final paperwork when the move was complete, tipped the gentlemen, and was done with the entire process without a drop of sweat spilled.I'm sold on Unpakt.

1074,5,7,5.0,"I didn't buy into the whole mixology thing until I walked into Amor y Amargo the second time. Came here to catch up with another former Seattle-ite on a Saturday night --- that was a bad idea (coming here on a Saturday night, not the catching up part). The place is small but not too crowded, so we stood by the bar and ended up getting a beer --- another bad idea.  Came back earlier this week on a weeknight and it was a much more pleasant experience. We briefly looked through the menu, ordered at the bar and promptly found some empty stools. Even though the bar was busy, I love that it didn't get too loud and the bartender was attentive despite us sitting away from the bar. I also love how warm, colorful, cozy, and incredibly intimate this place is. Wait, did I just use the words warm, colorful, cozy, and intimate in a positive light??? My friends would describe me as being extremely aloof, so I generally use these words with slight displease. When I pay $15+ for a drink, I'd like it to be pretty gosh darn good or I expect it to be pretty potent. So far, only Amor y Amargo drinks have lived up exceptionally well to BOTH expectations... and their drinks are actually less than $15! I had a couple Gin & Tonic (my absolute favorite), White Negroni, and a negroni dealer's choice (yes, yes, I had a few drinks on a weeknight, don't judge! It was a long week as Brooklyn B would say). All of the drinks I had were amazing and well worth the price. I can't wait to come back on another ""quiet"" weeknight.",8,0.9965

As a west coast native arriving here 10 years ago, there were 3 things I found shocking about New York's food...1) Crap Donuts. And the ""gems"" were mediocre at best. Really, I tried them. Yes, I went to Greenpoint.2) Crap Fro-Yo3) Lack of Decent Mexican Food on the Island of Manhattan. No, you cannot count Rosa Mexicana's pomegranate margaritas. Thankfully, in 10 years many things have changed. With all due respect for Dominique Ansel's Cronut Invasion, Doughnut Plant has won the war for my fried, golden dough heart. Would you call them classic? Of course not. The flavors are not the one's you grew up with. However, on taste and texture alone, I would take these everyday of the week (thankfully for my waist, not an everyday thing).The first time I tried the Creme Brulee doughnut was a moment. A moment that told me, ""you can do anything, and you like creme filled donuts with a charred sugar crust"". An hour later, I ate a porterhouse for two at Peter Luger. True story.You should eat here.

Look for an ""Gold Flower Restaurant"". The Chinese characters don't really match up either, it translates into ""Gold Flower Karaoke."" These signs were from the prior restaurant that no longer exists.As you walk in, you pass through a panel of heavy curtains, and you find yourself in a darkened room. Mosaic flooring, Victorian-era sofas, and lamps whose bulbs were fashioned out of beakers, line the path to the bar. The yellow tinted bar at the back provides the main source of lighting for the room. It also serves as the focal point of the room.The bar is beautifully aged. Its design is reminiscent of a chemical laboratory. Your bartenders wear white lab coats, your drinks are ordered off of a menu titled ""A Selection of House Prescriptions"" and all drinks feature some type of exotic, foreign ingredient. All drinks range from $15 to $18. You can't order shots like lemon drops here. Sorry college kids!SERVICE: If you're camped out on the couches, brace yourself for unbelievably slow service. It would be easier for you to grab your drinks at the bar and bring them back to an open table.PEOPLE: a mix of professionals relaxing after a long day, couples on dates - this is not a good first date spot, in my opinion.MUSIC: awesome 90s and throwbacks on weekends.

Off to Yelp I go! And at LaptopMD I found myself, plopped on a couch reading the NYTimes for less than 40 minutes. If anything, only 30 minutes. And everyone was so, so nice.

1078,6,6,5.0,"This is precisely what vegetarian eating should be. Normally, when I go to a restaurant I am forced to flip directly to the one small portion of the menu that caters to the vegetarians. On large menus there are usually a few items (sometimes even a whole section), but on smaller ones it's sometimes just one. One! Heaven help you if you don't want what they have chosen to serve you. Vegetarians deal with this dilemma every single time they go out to eat.I have been a vegetarian since I was pretty little. If you gave me a ham and cheese sandwich in kindergarten, I would have picked the ham out. It's not a moral thing, the idea of eating animals just creeps me out. When I was little, my dad would tell servers that I had a disease (jokingly, of course). This also happened:Me: What would you recommend for a vegetarian at this restaurant?Server: Ummm, lettuce?So, when I walked into this place and was handed a menu of pages... and pages.... of delicious vegetarian options? Happy doesn't quite cover it. I'm not trying to convert anyone. I'll eat my dinner, you eat yours. As far as I know, I'm not contagious, but it was nice to not have to worry if there is food for me for once.-------------------- Comes down from soapbox. ----------------The decor of this place is swanky and trendy, but not so much that you and a friend can't show up without a reservation and get a table for two. We had a prime spot next to a gorgeous fish tank. If the whole restaurant is as clean as that tank, we are in good shape. It was spotless. Definitely wins the award for cleanest tank ever. Service was prompt and friendly. Although, she never actually mentioned anything about the restaurant, or asked us if we had been here before. Seems like vigilante meat-eaters would want a warning about what they are ordering.We ordered some sake, which was reasonably priced at just $15 for the large. I got the fbeef teriyaki bento box, and my cohort got a fchicken stir fry.* Everything was soo good. The bento box came with salad, edamame, veggie potstickers, fcalifornia roll, and sliced teriyaki beef over vegetables. So much food for only $14! I ended up bringing a bunch of it home for tomorrow. I ended up asking my non-vgetarian cohort if hers was vegetarian too. Her response, ""Oh, I don't know. Is it?"" Victory.

The spicyness ratings are next to each preparation type so you know what you are getting yourself into. My favorites are the Dan Dan Noodles (must get, a large bowl of noodles for $8!) and the Dry Pepper Style fish (a white fish, tilapia, maybe?). A non-spicier option that I like is the 3-Cup Chicken, which is made of gingery, sweet soy sauce base.

Give them some sugary love too, yea?This adorable bakery reminds me of my favorite homey coffee shop back home on the west coast, and their cupcake truly trumps Magnolia's (dry & overrated) cupcakes by miles and miles. I'll list them for easy reading:1). Their cupcakes are under $2 each. In NYC. Yes, IN THE CITY!2). Their signage outside listing all the reasons why you should pop in to get a cupcake are all very convincing.2.1) Cupcakes are also most, fluffy, and delicious, so you won't feel betrayed by the sign.2.2) The Sunshine Cupcake is literally a cuppie baked from good ol'e simple sunshine happiness :)3). Not convinced? TRY THEIR TRIFLES. Their largest size is equivalent of an extra-value soda cup at Micky D's for a reason, because they're THAT GOOD that people buy them!

Despite all the rainbows and unicorns that comes with each bite of cupcake, it's not overly sweet, but sweet enough to bring a smile onto anyone's face.5).

Then you need to take a trip to The Setai Club & Spa!I opted for the Tour of Asia treatment which includes a lava bath, body scrub and shiatsu-like massage on a Friday afternoon. When I booked, I was told to bring loose fitting clothing for the massage portion, I could arrive 15 minutes early to enjoy the Aqua Grotto (steam room, sauna and jacuzzi), and could continue to enjoy after my treatment for as long as I wished. Even though I left my apartment with ample time and GPS in hand, I still managed to get lost. I received a phone call exactly at the time my treatment was to start, and they calmly and very nicely gave me directions. Upon arrival, I was ushered to the locker room, given a quick tour, and my therapist (Renata) was waiting for me at the door with bath already drawn. She added oil infused with lemongrass and rice milk to the lava bath, and left me with chai tea, water, and a green tea ice cream mochi to enjoy with my bath. Ahhhh, the little details! The body scrub was equally phenomenal, as every inch of my bod was scrubbed (minus my boobies and hoo ha). After I rinsed off, my skin felt so moisturized and was as smooth as a baby's bottom!  Renata had clothes laid out for the massage (another unexpected and very nice touch) and continued with the yoga-like massage that melted away my aches and pains. Unlike other spas that offer multiple treatments, this room was set up so everything was there (the bath, the shower to wash off the scrub, the massage table...so convenient and added to the ease and flow of everything). This totally contributed the unhurried feel from one treatment to the next, which resulted in even more relaxation. After my treatment, I was taken to the relaxation room where I was offered water, wine, champagne, and assorted mini treats which ranged from healthy to bite sized sweets. Again, all the little extras, hospitality and attention to detail!Now on to the amenities/facilities: In every locker is a super comfy robe, cushy cotton slippers, and rubber slippers (that actually fit and aren't one-size-fits all enormous) for the aqua grotto. Every fluffy towel is embroidered with their logo. The facility is super clean, and since I went on a weekday during the day, I had the entire aqua grotto to myself! This is hands down, THE BEST spa experience I've ever had...and I've been to spas in many different cities, countries and of every caliber.

On my walks up Pinehurst to the local grocery store over the past few months, I've been slowly watching the transformation of Rusty Mackerel from the old Vines on Pine location. I was a bit bummed at first, presuming it'd be a seafood place based on the title. As I started to follow their Twitter updates, I became a bit more excited with their menu offerings. Upon finding out the opening date, I offered to take the beau for a meal out on opening week. I was literally giddy at work the day of our dinner plans.My giddiness was not in vain.They worked the small space well; tables were a bit tight, but nothing that pulling them out a bit can't fix. A brightly drawn funky mackerel mural shone brightly over an open kitchen area in the rear. There's exposed brick, so, being a sucker for that, I immediately fell in love with the atomosphere. First, I needed sangria. NEEDED IT. A white version mixed with a rhubarb-strawberry reduction was velvety smooth and, legit, one of the best sangrias I've ever had. Second, we ordered the sea salted potatoes with smoked paprika aioli, brought to our table with much aplomb. Oh. My. GOD. I've had salted potatoes like this before, but this wins. Hands down. no contest. The aioli certainly makes these whole-boiled small potatoes not unlike Patatas Bravas. This dish is an absolute winner and a perfect plate to whet your hunger without overfilling you pre-entrees.I ordered the pan-roasted chicken with heirloom tomatoes and pecorino. The chicken was perfect, inside and out. Moist inside, and the chicken skin was perfectly crispy, oozing with oils and juices with each crunch. The beau got the steak frites with yucca fries and a béarnaise sauce. It came out a bit late as a new batch of yucca fries had to be made, but no matter. It was absolutely worth the wait! Medium-rare is the kitchen's perfered way of cooking it, and it was...wow...just wow. I'm also a big fan of yucca, so the fries were inhaled by me...more than him. (Sorry, Adam. Ha!)Last, the service was great. Everyone we talked to was friendly and asked for feedback on our meals. Thumbs up to our sever Jessica. Marcella, the general manager, both greeted us and sent us off, asking our names and shaking our hands. So kind!The food scene up in Washington Heights / Hudson Heights continues to burgeon, and Rusty Mackerel is definitely in the mix now. So glad y'all are here! Please stay. I insist!",18,0.9972
1085,11,10,5.0,"in my professional opinion as an american-born korean, this food hits the spot. it's basically like my mom came over with tons of food and told me i need more meat on my bones.my food was packaged nicely in paper, foldable boxes with accoutrements like kimchi. btw the kimchi is full-on, double-complete authentic. it comes free (because a meal without it is blasphemy) along with a wonderful message from the management. you really feel like the business cares a lot about your satisfaction with the new menu.despite korean food being really known for the bbq meat dishes I ordered all vegetarian: the jap-chae, the dumplings, and the paJun. the names are kinda ""out-there"" and i wasn't sure whether a disco ball was going to pop out of my food but they came through with some great flavor and awesome portions (especially the appetizers). I got 6, maybe 7 perfectly crisped and puffy dumplings. the paejun - the korean version of a scallion pancake - was fluffy on the inside and also perfectly crisped on the edges. my japchae was the slightly sweet and salty mix of sesame+soy sauce flavored glass noodles with marinated veggies.overall, this is officially my go-to for korean food in the FiDi area. honestly, they are pretty much single-handedly repping the cuisine in the area, but do a great job at it. bonus: you can top off your meal with a fro-yo while you're there.",19,0.9961
1086,16,15,5.0,"I love the Russian & Turkish Baths on 10th Street! I've been going to this East Village institution for almost a decade and have enjoyed their food and services religiously. Some have complained that the place is ""small"" or ""dirty"" compared to some of the newer Korean spas, but to these people I say, ""you're an idiot!"" I would describe this location as ""cozy"" with ""character"" just like my beloved East Village.The Russian & Turkish spa can be a intimidating affair for the first timer, so let me give you some tips that I've picked up over the years. First, check in with the counter person, they'll put all of your personal belongings like phones and wallets into a safe deposit box. Please note that you will not be able to get your phone and wallet out until you pay, so be sure you won't need to make a call. You might risk putting it into your clothes locker, but they don't guarantee safety (not that I've ever had a problem)Once you've got your safe deposit key, you'll be given a locker number. This number is stamped on the key and you can wear it around your wrist or ankle. You'll need to give your locker number whenever you order food or get services for which you pay at the very end. Please try the food, it's reasonably priced and delicious Russian fare. They have a great selection of Russian and Polish Beers and water, which you must have while schvitzing.They provide shorts, sandals, towels and robes. I usually bring my swim trunks and my own sandals. Once ready, go downstairs and take a quick shower. There are 5 rooms of various heat intensity as well as an ice cold bath to refresh you between rooms. Try them all! In some rooms, if it gets too hot you can douse yourself with a bucket of ice cold water.You'll find several employees and regulars downstairs that will offer massages and the infamous Platza aka ""waterboarding"". If you've never had the Platza, I recommend it at least once. It's where you get beaten by oak leaves. They have ways of making you talk! You'll be so glad you've survived the experience, you'll have a new zest for live. For reals.If the weather's nice you can go up to the roof and sun on the roof deck. You may also see people with mud masks, which you can purchase there. Sometimes I imagine living in NY when this place was the only place you can wash up. Mind blowing.I love to go during the middle of the week and during the day to avoid the crowds. I recommend checking out their schedule as they have Co-Ed times where shorts are required and gender-specific times where you can drop trou! I once went on a men's only day and saw so much penis. I can't unsee it.  On occasion, I have rub shoulders with actors here including; Colin Farrell and Sam Rockwell, so that's kind of coolIf you do like the place you can buy multi-day passes at a discount, but keep in mind the business is run separately by weeks, It's weird, each week is run by either Boris or David. You can tell which week it is by the calendar on their website,. The prices are the same, but when you buy a pass it's week specific so keep that in mind. My buddy and I split the weeks, he has David's weeks and I have Boris' weeks so we're always covered!Anyway, please come. I highly recommend this place! Happy Schvitzing!",30,0.9972
1087,7,0,5.0,"I wish I had discovered this place sooner. The happy hour here is outstanding, and if you're a seafood person, not something to miss. The combination of a vast beer, wine, and cocktail menu and a ridiculous amount of seafood options is killer.The happy hour special runs for 4-7 and features $4 beers, wines, and cocktails, $16 pitchers, and amazingly, $4 sliders of lobster, crab cake, or fried oysters. Oh yea, raw oysters are just a buck too. My person favorite was the lobster roll, and unlike so many other places, the Lobster Joint doesn't shy away from giving you heaping pieces of lobster meat. My first slider came with an entire claw in it and the following ones were just as hearty. What really made the sandwich stand out was the balance between the lobster and the mayo. As a person that doesn't love mayo, I sometimes shy away but in this case it was spot on and more importantly it was not used a filler to give you less meat. The space itself is also a refreshing clean design. Very tall ceilings, inviting long tables built for groups of friends to hang out, and tasteful seaside flair on the walls. The wait staff was incredible and friendly, promptly bringing food or drinks when they were ready, and offering helpful suggestions along the way. For any fans of good seafood, happy hours with plenty of options, and great overall experiences, I highly recommend coming in here.

Simple, amazing and unlike anything we've seen before.Eight Turn Crepe takes that formula, plus a DJ, some promoters, a really good sound system, and throws a party in your mouth. The form is quite simple. It's a cone, which is kind of perfect for New York. It's convenient, understanding the on-the-go lifestyle, and quite frankly, as far as a fork and knife go in consuming my dessert - ain't nobody got time for that. The cone comes in a wrapper that you unwrap diagonally as you make your way down the crepe goodness. I'm proud to say I didn't get an ounce of it on my clothes. As far as the party in my mouth, my crepe was literally a party - the Chocolate Nut Party - 4 types of nuts (almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, and pistachios)- 3 chocolate elements (chocolate sauce, chocolate custard cream, chocolate Pocky Sticks)Add some vanilla ice cream, homemade whipped yogurt (amazing), and wrap it in a gluten-free rice flour crepe, and drop the beat. ""Oh snap, is that Tiesto spinning in my mouth?"" you ask. Why, yes. Yes, it is.That was just one of the 10 sweet crepes on the menu.

You will be pleased to know that La Colombe, one of the top roasters in the world, is used to brew the coffee and espresso drinks. Need something sweet in a cup? Try one of the shakes. I had a sip of the Matcha Shake. Green Tea + Ice Cream shake = refreshing, unexpected, revolutionary. Sweet tooth satisfied? or in the mood for something on the entree? These guys have a savory category on their menu that includes eggs (not your diner eggs, Flo - truffled egg white omelet), lox, and turkey. Their salad crepes highlight the Japanese origins of this crepe-in-a-cone business, with an ever-so-slight French accent - Tofu Edamame, Seaweed Sesame, Tuna Nicoise and others will act as a perfect on-the-go lunch. Add some truffled shrooms to that crepe for a greater French accent, or other additions that will satisfy that hunger of yours. This place is going to revolutionize the way you see, eat, and walk with crepes. Ever walk with a crepe? Didn't think so.

The guy saw our disappointment and LENT US A PAIR OF HIS SHOES. No, really. BRO LENT US A PAIR OF HIS OWN SHOES for our guy to wear (and he wanted nothing in return).

The bartender saw this and very kindly made me another drink at no charge; he didn't look offended at all and agreed that the drink is a hit or a miss with people.After a few drinks we headed out to make our reservations at Morimoto's. In the end the hostess was very nice when we walked in and the bartender was more than kind.

Apparently u have to know someone or who's been there before to go - that always adds cachet.I thought the tasting menu at 58 pp was a great deal, esp given how much food u get. The ambience here is sleek yet not stuffy. A great date place for sure.Dish ratings on a yelp scale: (5 as good as it gets, 1 methinks not)5 - foi gras soba. My fav of the night. Maybe I was hungover and just needed some comfort soup. Broth was light yet flavorful and delicious and the fatty piece of foie gras gave it a wonderful umph to the dish.5- branzino. It just looked and smelled amazing. Charred sides gave added flavor. The sound of crackling and bubbling still cooking made it even cooler. Way large portion - couldn't finish it. Get sea salt on the side to taste. Tip: they should char the rosemary so that u can eat it - it smells deliciously aromatic, but it would be wonderful to taste (had rosemary this style at a random bar food once and it was simple and delicious).4.5 - uni croquette. I still prefer my uni unadultered but the croquette had good creaminess and the flavor did not overpower the uni goodness4.5 beef short rib - raw. So tender and tasty.3.5 fish egg rice bowl - good but the large (salmon?) fish eggs r not my flavor preference3.5 vegetable fondue - not something I'd normally order, but the freshness of the raw veggies was a nice departure from the crap I normally eat.3.5 beef sliders - nothing wrong w it, but nothing wowed me with this. Very beefy, if that makes sense.Drinks were wow good5 - burgamot. WOW. Good. My fav5 - jaguar - never knew whiskey could taste so good w chocolate. Not overly sweet either4 - mint gold - kinda like a mojito w some spice. Came In a very large glass so I suppose if ur really thirsty",18,0.9944
1095,18,22,5.0,"There are a few benchmark moments in your New York life. The first time you got an apartment without a cosigner. The moment you got a room big enough to fit a queen bed. The moment when you finally got a grant for that artsy fartsy project you've been working on. For many, an invitation to the Soho House might be the ultimate prize though. The Soho House to me has always been a distant idea. But when I got an invite recently, I couldn't help but play Drake's ""Started From the Bottom"" over and over and over. I was recently recommended as a member and was invited for a night at the Soho House. I bought a new outfit, took my concord Jordans out of their air and temperature controlled environment, and got into a fancy yellow SUV cab downtown.  I had been before, but this time around, I got the full treatment and I was very impressed. The music was on point and the crowd was oh so good looking. I'm a huge nerd, and don't know if I quite fit in, but for one night I felt like I was hanging out at the cool table.The people I met were so interesting and the place really tries to keep the corporate types out, which is a huge plus in my book. My friend was on a mission to meet some women, and about five minutes in, I could tell his brain and eyes were about to explode. I can't say enough about how cool the crowd was. The drinks were very well made. I don't know if I am gonna be a member, as there is a tiny fee even for invitees, but I might have to take the plunge. If you know someone that is a member, I think you might have found a new best friend.",11,0.9947

It's a little tough to find but keep an eye out for the signage. You'll have to walk up a narrow and shady looking stairset before you walk into this small operation. Upon entering, you'll be immediately greeted and asked if you have any specific issues (back, legs, sports injury, etc.). You then agree to a set distribution of time between various parts of your body, in my case, 20 minutes of legs/feet and 40 minutes of back.Don't come in expecting a light patdown. I thoroughly got my ass kicked before leaving. They will really apply the pressure on all your pressure points and challenge you not to shed a tear in the process. If you have lots of knots, you'll hear cracking and popping noises you never thought possible in various parts of your body. I have a high pain tolerance and I almost screamed mercy a few times during the back portion of the massage. Elbows are involved. A not so strong guy to my immediate side was screaming murder. I felt more uncomfortable from the wailing next to me than my immediate pain.

1097,12,10,5.0,"I am writing this review for the only one thing that I eat at Excellent Pork Chop, #13N-1 Pork with Pickled Mustard Green Noodle Soup. Before I didn't usually come here even though I live one block away. I never really liked Taiwanese Pork Chop over rice because I don't like preserved or sour cabbage. It's not my thing. Taiwanese food has a lot of this type of vegetable in a lot of their dishes so I avoided this place for a long long time....until....One day, last year, my bf convinced me to go with his friend, Helen, for lunch here. I was so worried to go to lunch here because I was afraid I won't like anything but Helen proved me wrong. I walked in late and Helen already ordered for us. Okay, I'll go with the flow. I saw this bowl of noodles on the table. It was bright green from the mustard greens in it. I was afraid to try it because my experience with Taiwanese food has never been very pleasant. One sip of the soup and one taste of the vegetables and I was in love. Wow. I was looking for the menu name and couldn't figure it out until recently, it's called Pork with Pickled Mustard Green Noodle Soup but it was not pickled tasting at all. I don't like pickled greens so I do not think it is pickled. My bf tried it too and doesn't think it is pickled either. There are bitter undertones from the mustard green. It is not super bitter but the mustard green has a natural bitter undertone which tastes great. It's very mild bitter undertone though. Super mild, which I like. I don't really like strong sour or bitter flavoring so this soup is perfect for me. I have had this noodle every time I visited this restaurant recently. It's been great every time. Awesome. I'm glad to have found something I like in a Taiwanese restaurant. Now I don't have to avoid it. It' is only $5.25 for this noodle soup. I highly recommend this bowl of noodles in Excellent Pork Chop. The decor is near none. There is nothing fancy in here. Nothing to look at but I don't care. The reason why I am in here? #13N-1. I had it even during the middle of summer. I was sweating a little but afterwards it gave me a reason to share Taiwanese ice with my boyfriend. We had red beans, taro and condensed milk on our ice that totally cooled us down from the hot soups. Ice is $3.50 with 3 toppings. PERFECT! I love my bowl of soup!",14,0.9882
1098,21,17,5.0,"I don't know what has become of me. First I waited in line for cronuts last month and now I've waited in line for the first Umami Burger in NYC (on its first day of business, no less). I hardly ever wait in lines like this. By the way, it's ""in line"" and not ""on line"", right? I may be biased because I was starving, I was experiencing voorpret, and I felt rebellious for temporarily ditching my self-imposed no red meat diet. However, after watching fellow patrons and hearing their ooh's and ahh's, I don't think I was the only one who thought it was all worth it. I strongly believe New Yorkers are going to embrace Umami Burger for a very long time. One of the logos is an image of a hamburger that also kind of looks like a kiss mark! It's very fitting.We ordered the:- Original Umami Burger ($12) My favorite! All of the burgers are a variation of the Original, but have additional toppings and condiments. This burger includes a hand-ground, medium rare patty that really doesn't need any help from additional garnishes; it is slightly crispy on the outside, crumbly and juicy on the inside, and well-seasoned throughout. The burger is enhanced with an umami ketchup with strong notes of truffles, a sea kelp powder, bonito flake and oyster extracts, melt-in-your-mouth caramelized onions, an oven roasted tomato, shiitake mushrooms, and a crunchy and salty Parmesan crisp. ALL of this is sandwiched between two delightful, softly toasted, slightly sweet Portuguese buns. The condiments are also on the lower part of the entire burger, so it hits the tongue first and creates a much more dynamic flavor. Yum, yum, yum. Umami, umami, umami. - Manly Burger ($12)This burger is (excuse the gender stereotype) very manly. Delicious beer-cheddar cheese, smoked and crispy salt-onion strings and bacon lardon are stacked high on a very thick patty. With each bite, juices from all of the ingredients dribble onto the buns and sometimes onto the hands. The Manly burger is a messy, but delicious burger. - Vintage Burger ($10)This is an off-menu item. These off-menu items vary between locations and these are the items that make Umami Burger less of a chain, and more of a restaurant group. This burger is similar to the Original, but has a smashed patty. I didn't particularly like the smashed patty as much.- Cheesy Tots ($5)This side dish is also an off-menu item. As the name suggests, they are tater tots filled with cheese and are delicious with the accompanying umami ketchup, garlic aioli, and jalapeño ranch dipping sauces.THE SERVICE IS AMAZING.It was opening day, but none of the employees were the slightest bit frazzled or angry. The gentleman writing down and calling out names was so sweet and apologized profusely for our hour-long wait (which was surprisingly much shorter than what I had imagined it would be). The waiter who brought us to our table apologized for the wait. Our waitress, Jessica, apologized for the wait. Everyone apologized for the wait!! Since it was our first time at an Umami Burger, Jessica explained the burgers to us with great detail and enthusiasm. She also took our cheesy tots order off of our bill because they arrived after our burgers! What?! I really hope this high quality service continues.Likelihood of another visit:I'm usually a pretty light eater, but I almost thought of ordering another Original Burger, so that should tell you something. I'm also excited to try the Truffle Burger and the turkey burger! They also have a pretty extensive list of cocktails with names inspired by things around the neighborhood.",31,0.9982
1099,7,10,5.0,"Getting to PH-D is similar to walking through an airport to find the gate of your plane. IDs: Check. Stamp: Check. Then walk straight on, make a left, make a right, get stamp checked, take elevator up to the 12th floor, where they check stamp again, and finally (insert drum ruffle here) YOU MADE IT! To PH-D!!! For a good impression of the experience here, I suggest you watch this: youtube.com/watch?featur…Anyhow, back to PhD rooftop... VIEW: You will be astonished by PH-D's view on NYC's magnificent skyline and the empire state building, which has a different color each day. Only Le Bain might come somewhat close to it when it comes to cool venues with an awesome view. The ceiling inside has beautiful, jaw dropping chandeliers. CROWD: Lots of 'suits', high heeled ladies, models, mixed with normal looking young people. Some of them react to having their table with bottle service in an endearing way, looking all proud, smiles from ear to ear, almost so disproportionately happy with this huge, significant life event, that you can't help but feel happy for them as well. All of this is of course in dark contrast with the promoter/model tables, where the girls are to look bored when they're not dancing, and where it's definitely a faux pas to clap and scream when champagne with fireworks come to the table. PhD also seems to be used as a parking lot by the promoters' hot entourage, until they can move on to 1Oak or Marquee.  MUSIC: The DJ's play pretty good dance music here, mostly Hip-Hop and top 40. They could tone down the amount of female condescending Hip-Hop they spin. Too much 'Ho', ""Bitch', 'Put yer fucking hands up' 'Niggas' 'Ass ass ass ass' ....But besides that: Great music. DJ booth looks pretty impressive. It's often flanked by go-go dancers, and sometimes a live violinist or saxophonist performs along with the beats of the music. BOTTOM LINE: PH-D is professionally set up and run. Very well put together. There is a reason I keep coming back here!!! It's got a good vibe and an above decent crowd. I love PH-D on Sunset Saturdays ( starts around 7PM ). Ideally you go to Day & Night Brunch prior, or Lavo Brunch, then to PH-D and then on to Lavo or Marquee if you have energy left.",17,0.9947
1100,7,2,5.0,"Takashi is a great treat when it comes to enjoying luxurious cuts of beef and experiencing the cuts of organ meats. Keep in mind many items of the menu are an aquired taste, and the small plates and price might be a deterrent. If you come in hungry, get the Kobe Chuck flat steak (6 oz steak) and rice and you should be able to enjoy the other cuts of beef without worrying that you'll be hungry. My Favorites:Niku-Uni - How can you go wrong, Kobe slice, Fresh Uni, this dish melts in your mouth and you really have to savor it.Kalbi (Kobe Shortrib) - Amazing and buttery cut of beef, the texture was smooth and fatty, we got it marinated with Takashi sauce.The Good:Tsurami (cheek) - very flavorful, we got it with garlic and sesame oil eat bite was delicious and the texture was rough and chewy.Hatsu (Heart) - I liked this a lot, I've eaten chicken heart at some yakitori places but never tried beef heart, this comes in very small bit size bites, you place them on the grill and grill for 1 minute each, the flavor is very hearty but not striking, the texture is like a smooth paste.The service was fantastic and very friendly and attentive, we sat in front of the chefs near the entrance, we got in after a 5 minute wait and were luckily because the people behind us were quoted a 40 minute wait and the manager took their numbers to let them know when a table would be ready. At no point did we feel rushed and we were able to enjoy each part of the meal at our pace.I sat looking at the large warning sign with a silhouette of a cow on it, I didn't really get it until I saw the sign, from my experience Japanese do not eat a whole lot of beef so when they do they explore the small cuts of every part of the cow and discover the flavor of each part. That's what Takashi is to me, beef by nature is a luxury in japan, and Takashi takes the time and energy to translate the experience of japanese beef eating in america where beef is plenty, I learned to slowed down and enjoy the flavors and textures of each parts of the meat, it's an interesting and delicious experiment.",7,0.9916
1101,7,4,5.0,"Dinner at Gotham is a must if you're looking for somewhere nice to splurge. After mentioning it in conversation a few times, my friend and I decided to finally make a dinner reservation for 6:30pm here on a Sunday night.The restaurant was surprisingly very empty when we arrived, but by the time we left (around 9pm) it was almost entirely full, which I found very odd for a Sunday night. Another thing I found unusual: the number of families dining there with small children. The table next to us had two preschool-age children, and Gotham seems to be very good at accommodating small kiddies - I overheard the waiter offering the kids a plate of chicken with shoestring potatoes, which was obviously not on their normal dinner menu.As for our own food, my friend and I decided to share two appetizers: the striped bass ceviche and yellowfin tuna tartare. Our waiter kindly offered to split each appetizer into two separate plates for us, which saved us the trouble of having to halve everything ourselves. The striped bass ceviche came with several pieces of fish topped with leaves and citrusy bits, and the waiter poured a slightly spicy Thai broth into the dish. I'd never had striped bass ceviche before, and found it interesting because it tasted less raw than other ceviches I've had, but the Thai and citrus flavors were great. Our second appetizer, the yellowfin tuna tartare, came centered neatly on a plate, with two pieces of toasted bread and surrounded by cucumber slices dotted with Asian ginger vinaigrette. Ceviches and tartares are probably my two favorite types of raw fish dishes, but when it came to these two appetizers, I definitely liked the tuna tartare more - the tuna was so nicely complemented by the cucumber slices and toasted bread.For my entree, I ordered the Berkshire pork chop. The pork was very tender and I liked the sauce. Unfortunately, the waiter gave me a very dull knife so cutting the pork was quite a struggle. I wasn't a huge fan of the vegetables (mainly the roasted fennel) that came on the side, either. While taking a break from sawing away at my pork, I also tried a bite of my friend's entree, the Maine lobster, which tasted buttery and delicious. The broth that it came in tasted like lobster bisque.Being the gourmands (read: fatties) that we are, we also decided to split a dessert. We went with the apricot souffle, which was unbelievably good. The texture of the souffle was super light and fluffy. The apricot flavor was present but not overly sweet, and my first thought upon taking a bite was, ""This would make a great tea flavor."" The souffle also came with apricot sorbet, panna cotta (extra delicious!), and apricot slices on the side, all very nicely completing the apricot palette. Then, just when we thought we'd finished with all of our dinner courses, we were also given a small cup of complimentary, bite-size financiers that came in 3 different flavors: pistachio, almond, and chocolate. A wonderful ending to our dinner!Conclusion: Food and service are both outstanding... dinner here doesn't come cheap, but it's very, very worth it!",10,0.9975
1102,8,3,5.0,"I hate to admit it but I'm guilty of being a bit of a sushi snob. I've been spoiled by places like Tokyo's fish market, Yasuda, 15 East, Ushiwakamaru, Sushi of Gari, Azabu...Despite my high standards, I was absolutely blown away by Ichimura's omakase. For those of you who are as obsessed with finding the best omakases as I am, you must put this place on your list. It was absolute perfection. You know how sometimes you walk away from a good meal and you have one, maybe two, things that stays on your mind? Almost EVERYTHING that chef Ichimura served was memorable and beautifully executed. My only criticism is that, after $550 for two people, I left still a bit hungry. We started with a beautiful array of small bites: miniature squid, torched tuna, daikon, and a few others. The squid was my favorite. Not only was it so freakin' adorable since I've never seen such a tiny squid but it was delicious and had an amazing soft texture. Next we had uni on top of fish and I'm a complete sucker for uni so that was amazing as expected. I think it may have been slightly torched because the texture was firmer than usual. There was also a small dish of sushi with some diced greens on top, followed by a light crab soup. And finally, the sashimi. Nothing beats amazing, fresh quality sashimi that makes your eyes roll back in your head as soon as you put it in your mouth. I loved the contrast of the different tastes and textures that Ichimura put together. It was so decadent and just melts.When you make a reservation, make sure it's for Ichimura's omakase--it's different from the brushstroke restaurant. The omakase is in a little room off to the side at 9 person sushi bar. It's a really intimate setting and an amazing experience.",17,0.996

And you especially won't appreciate Sean Muldoon and Jack McGarry formerly from their award-winning watering hole in Northern Ireland's Merchant Hotel.The chill Taproom downstairs and the gorgeous cocktails Parlor upstairs will certainly not wow you.

The drinks are so unique. I was very impressed! The prices range from $10-$12 which are not bad for what you are getting. I recommend the ""Garden Variery Margarita"" (kale margarita) and the ""I hear Banjos"" drink which contains moonshine. This drink is very strong and worth the $12. The presentation is also very cool, I can't explain it just check out the pics. Will definitely be coming back.

1106,13,14,5.0,"These tacos are INSANE! I can't think of any better quality Mexican food in NYC, and I've done Suenos, Dos Toros, Jackson Heights, Spanish Harlem, etc... Los Tacos No. 1 is hands down the best. The Menu:Comprised of tacos and quesadillas mostly. The quesadillas are the same size as the tacos, but griddled and with cheese. They also do nopal (cactus) plates, chips/salsa, and various Mexican sodas. The Spread:Select your taco filling: grilled steak (carne asada), grilled chicken (pollo asado), marinated pork (adobada), or cactus (nopal). Then choose corn or flour tortillas. Finally, choose your extras: guacamole, cilantro, onions, and salsa. Afterwards, you can garnish everything with cucumbers, limes, blistered peppers, hot salsa (red), and mild tomatillo salsa (green). The Set-up:Place your order and pay at the first register on the right counter of the stand. Then move over to the left counter, give the man your receipt, and tell him which tortilla/extras you'd like. There is ample counter space at the stand, and along the windows facing W. 15th St. The Locale:Once inside Chelsea Market, you will be able to locate Los Tacos No. 1 from a few visual clues. It's off a southern side passage from the main drag. Just find the spice store (or sniff it out), then walk south. It's directly across from Hybird. The Meal:I wasn't sure how big the quesadillas would be, so I went with one steak quesadilla on a flour tortilla with guacamole to start. I love that they don't make you get onions and cilantro! I know it's authentic, but I don't like raw onions, and I have a strong aversion to cilantro. I sauced it up with both hot salsa and green salsa, and then some lime juice. After one bite I was in love. The steak was so juicy, but still maintained the charred taste of the grill. The soft flour tortilla was great quality, and all the flavors worked together to form a complete package. I finished eating, but still had some room, so I decided to maybe try an overpriced Questlove Hybird drumstick, or maybe some Mexican corn from nearby Num Pang. But Num Pang didn't have any corn, and I couldn't shake my desire for another Los Taco No. 1 quesadilla. So I got back in the line (which was much longer now), and went with a pork quesadilla on corn tortilla this time. The pork is actually cut from a rotating spit (!), like gyro meat, then thrown on the griddle to add smokey char. As I waited again, I noticed the women in the back actually making the tortillas in house from masa. Now that is a fresh tortilla. I gobbled down another quesadilla, and by then I was satisfied, though other people could probably eat another taco/quesadilla or chips, additionally.The Verdict:I don't give out many 5 star reviews. I mean, I just gave one to Momofuku Ko, but like... that's Ko, that's to be expected. I wrestled with giving it a 4 because of the disorganized line situation. Honestly, one of my BIGGEST pet peeves of this city is that New Yorkers are notoriously aggressive line-cutters, and on a busy day I could see that being an issue, especially as this place gains in popularity, which I see happening in a big way. However, the food is too fantastic to care about any other minor annoyances. 5 stars.",21,0.9922

She took down our number and told us that she will text us when the table is ready (awesome!). We were actually able to sit down quicker than we expected. They offered us that particular table only if we could finish our meal within 1 hour (I don't think this is common. They probably had some reservations).

1109,17,13,5.0,"Since the arrival of Fatty Crab in 2005, the ""Fatty Crew"" has been opening comfortable, semi-hip, low-key restaurants exoticized by way of Southeast Asia across New York City. Given her mother's Filipino roots, and her recent travels throughout the region, it was no surprise that former Top Chef contestant Leah Cohen was tapped to head their latest venture: Pig and Khao.Pig and Khao is situated on a stretch of Clinton street that, while it has invariably begun the process of gentrification (which Pig and Khao doubtlessly contributes to), is not entirely overrun by assholes. Aside from knowledgeable residents of the area slinking in and out of Barramundi, and the 11pm rushes to Prosperity Dumpling, there is little here to suggest that you are in the nouveau Lower East Side; of insipid bars on every corner. Instead, Pig and Khao is the boisterous neighbor in a sleepy hamlet. Truly, it is best not to underestimate the obstreperous atmosphere within: if you enjoy having dinner with a significant other or date on the weekend, but also enjoy hearing them talk, you'd be best served coming at the restaurant's closing or opening. Primetime seems reserved for the hooters and hollerers. The noise is mitigated a bit if you manage to be seated at the kitchen counter, as M and I were. As an obvious added benefit, you get to see the dishes you're considering ordering as they're prepared for other parties. It then becomes a rather difficult proposition to be led by your stomach and not your eyes - the plates are surprisingly large, but the various sights will entice you to order more than any reasonable person ought to. After you've seen sumptuous flecks of pork being braised with various chilies and herbs, chaotically piled onto a cast iron pan, finished off with an egg cracked right down the center, sizzling through the dining room as it's carried away, try to resist ordering one of your own. It's nearly impossible. Equally evident from this seating arrangement is the control with which Ms. Cohen runs her kitchen. In spite of the relatively small breadth of the restaurant, it holds a sizable number of people at capacity, and the kitchen is quite small. But Ms. Cohen and her staff pushed out dish after dish with aplomb. And what a series of delightful dishes they were.M and I began with the Quail Adobo; sticky, vinegary, garlicky, peppery segments of bird that may have singlehandedly answered the question as to why Dick Cheney was intent on hunting them. I had no shame in pulling pieces of flesh from each wing and dipping them into the sauce that had pooled on our small porcelain plate. Such is the power of a sauce thoughtfully comprised of compatible, familiar elements. What followed was what I thought was sure to be our moment of truth; the Sizzling Sissig. The couple adjacent us smiled knowingly at the telltale crackle, having just polished off their own. As we mixed the freshly broken egg, the lime juice, and the caramelized bits of ephemera (ginger, kaffir leaves, bird chilies) the aroma became more than the sum of its parts, and we could mix no further without trying what was before us. The heaviness of the pork and egg was cut by the lime juice, but the smokiness afforded by the charred accoutrements enhanced the natural fattiness and surprising heartiness of the pork. The heat from the chilies lingered briefly, but only enough to assert its presence. Each bite was addicting, and the gambit of finishing the plate before the scattered bits grew cold took on a much more serious air than was necessary. After the pan was removed, we were presented with our penultimate dish: the Khao Soi. A bit redder in color than I had typically seen in Chiang Mai (where the dish originated), I was excited for what I presumed to be the additional heat, while M was terrified. Seeing her trepidation, the sous chef playfully handed her a few more lime segments. But in truth, what aided most in combating the spiciness was our side of coconut rice. Fluffy, sweet, and utterly saturated with coconut flavor, in part thanks to the actual slivers of coconut, it was the perfect accompaniment. The curry had an admirable depth, with the dark meat of the chicken thigh adding additional savoriness and the bitter, tangy punch of pickled mustard greens standing in for the traditional, brighter cilantro. The topping of fried egg noodles was a nod to the typical means of textural contrast. Between the size of the bowl of curry itself and the amount of rice paired with it, we were lucky to finish it, especially given the substantial amount of food we had eaten just prior. But when I saw Halo Halo on the menu, I knew from the onset that we would be trying it, gastrointestinal constraints be damned. The flan bits were an interesting twist, and a thoroughly welcome one, as the dessert was better than I remembered.Ms. Cohen, I fist bumped you ostensibly because of your choice of 2chainz as background music, but really, it was because of your food.",22,0.9956

Think ceviche on nachos, riding in a monster truck.If you drink (like me) and prefer gin as your poison (also like me), you won't go wrong with their shiso cucumber (15): a mix of Bulldog gin, muddled shiso and cucumber, and fresh lemon juice. It's so fresh you'll want to rinse your mouth out with the stuff. But please don't.Service is superb. Tip accordingly.",30,0.8633

Melt Shop stands out from the crowd in FAST service, variety, and most importantly...fabulous, buttery, indulgent cheese.Although they're all pretty much winners, my personal fave is the truffle melt. It's got everything you pay $32 for in a pasta pretty much anywhere downtown, but with MORE cheese, spicy arugula, and fresh sourdough. The truffle isn't overpowering..it just has the capability to bring TEARS to your EYES with its subtlety. And it's less than $8.Did I mention they also offer tater tots, with a variety of dips? And milkshakes.Custom service is speedy and friendly. They were also open, slingin' melty sandwiches, during Hurricane Sandy, which I think really speaks to their character. They are a people of integrity, dedication to their cheesy craft, that can't be closed down by a little wind and rain.THEY ALSO SERVE BEER. (Drop the mic Melt Shop....you win.)",15,0.9387
1112,22,25,5.0,"The ideal first date, 100th date, or break-up date. I called to make reservations (and ask a million questions) and Adele answered, the hostess with the mostess! She answered every one of my stupid questions from what the weather was going to be like to what kind of comedy I should expect. Since I was tight on time, she suggested seeing the comedy show first than having dinner (most do it the opposite way I suppose). She was so helpful and sweet, my excitement soared. PARKING: If we parked any closer, we would have been on the stage. Lots of free parking - score!COMEDY CLUB PORTION: Located in the basement, pretty spacious for a comedy club, usually they are way more crammed and you end up sitting on top of others (in NYC). I thought the temperature was fine, but my date, a big muscle man felt hot (but don't they always?). No Drink minimum, or maximum of course! You can also order dessert and snacks if you choose to, the choice is yours (unlike other clubs again). The comedians were all pretty good (& plentiful), probably depends how drunk you are or if you actually have a sense of humor (I laughed and I'm a tough person).FOOD: Wow! I almost don't want to talk about it so you guys can be surprised. Truffle mac & cheese. Crab cakes. Juicy cheeseburger dumplings. Chicken Pot Pie. Nachos with enough sour cream. Nutella Fondue. And I have also had the BEST dessert I have ever taste - CHOCOLATE CARAMEL PRETZEL BREAD PUDDING.SERVICE: On top of Adele being awesome, STEVE was my waiter, and really I felt like he was my friend or even my family member during the time I dined there. He starts with the drink menu, I wanted Amaretto or Malibu and they didn't have either so he was super sensitive about it and told me he would find me a drink that would make me happy, and of course he did! He suggested the mac n cheese with truffle oil and I could probably eat that dish everyday until I'm 88. He checked up on us just the right amount of times. I wanted him to sit down and dine with us, that's how great he was! Bottom line: If you really like someone, take them here. If you really don't like someone but want to sleep with them, take them here. Just take anyone here or go solo... it's that worth it :)",24,0.9982

Like seriously you have to strategically plan which subway you get off and which side of the street to come above ground or you spend hours trying to get around the throngs on foot. Needless to say, I didn't make it in time. However, I figured I had to try this place out anyway since I spent 1.5 hrs and about 2 gallons of sweat trekking from the UES down here. Place better be freaking good... I swear... God's be great, this place is exactly what I imagine a coffee/tea house to be... Small and cozy but not cramped, variety of seating so you can enjoy their tasty delights either by yourself, at a high top, in a section with friends, perched in the perfect, people watching vantage point, or on the little love seat with coffee table and an area rug... How quaint. The accents, wallpaper, fixtures and everything about the interior just feels comfortable, warm, and inviting. As far as the libations go, the menu can be a little daunting, not in its sheer size, but in that the concept is a bit foreign... I still don't really get it, but this is what I gathered: you pick a tea, they brew it espresso style so you have a concentrated vial of caffeine with which you can mix as you please. I like to go with the staff's suggestion in situations like this, and we arrived at a black tea macchiato with vanilla flavor and caramel drizzle.  Delish.  I'm sure you can go more exotic, but I was intent in getting the highest mg caffeine/$. And at $4.50 for a large, that's like the same or less than some faux swill from Starbutts or wherever. Unless you like faux swill... Then I guess don't come here. Added bonus, I found the check in offer for a pastry and decided on this blueberry thing... There was only 1 left so I figured it must be good. (Sheep or deductive reasoning? I'll go with the latter to feel better about myself. ) Luckily, the last blueberry thingamajig ended up being a crumbly blueberry cheesecake thing with an ever so slight hint of lemon? I think. Whatever, it was divine. See the pics... I couldn't help from tasting it before I remembered to post a photo. I'd like to try the rest of the pastries too as they all looked pretty awesome. Note, the guy in front of me ordered a sandwich and was rudely awoken to the fact that the portion is quite small. And you only get half. Womp Womp Womp, but honestly why would you order a sandwich here anyway...? Do yourself a favor and try this place out. It's specialty without the jacked up specialty prices.

Head to Pó!Step in to the small, hallway sized eatery (simply designed with white walls and mirrors) and hope to be lucky enough to grab a table...or plan ahead with reservations.You have to start with the White Bean Bruschetta. It's a great, fresh way to start off while you look at the menu or decide on a wine to accompany your meal.I'd recommend starting with the Polpetta di Carne (meatballs with tomato sauce & caciocavallo). They are perfect...and just like my great-grandma used to make. Next, move on to the Roasted Beets salad (with endive, artichokes, watercress & taleggio crostino). It's flavorful and palate cleansing enough to get you ready for pasta. Speaking of pasta: the Linguini Vongole (with fresh calms, pancetta, red chile & white wine) is absolutely incredible. The clams, still in the shell, are so damn good with pancetta. After this delight, I opted for the Grilled Pork Chop with braised cabbage & cranberry/apple mostarda. Perfectly cooked and tender, the pork was just enough to end the heavy part of the meal...and still leave just enough room for some dessert! For the final course: Panna Cotta, with amarena cherries & ""Affogato"" (coffee gelato, chilled cappuccino and chocolate caramel sauce), both of which were insanely good. Accompany all of this with a bottle or two of '06 Primitivo and you're all set...The service, flavors and overal ambiance of this place make it one of my favorite places to dine in the West Village, worthy of a special occasion or just a regular meal.",12,0.9919
1115,9,9,5.0,"I'd like to say that no pigs were harmed in the making of this review, but with our three swine-based plates, unfortunately that wasn't the case :) After our awesome experience at Salinas, I'll surely be returning back to sample some other tasty animals!For starters, my friend and I snagged the pork belly and the bacon-wrapped quail off the tapas menu. The pork belly - served over squash, roasted garlic, and a vinegar reduction - was crisp on the outside, but tender and melt-in-your-mouth juicy on the inside. As for the bacon-wrapped quail, the bacon was both crisp and practically fused onto the quail leg....this was PERFECT. Far too often, when a place offers bacon-wrapped anything, floppy bacon is loosely attached to the ""host food"" and once you cut it with a knife, the whole experience is lost.For entrees, my friend went for the steak special - a 9oz ribeye cut into tender slices and garnished with a delicious and creamy sauce drizzle. My slow-roasted suckling pig was the show stealer however - beneath a layer of crispy skin was a bed of super-tender meat that was so soft, it actually put the previous pork belly appetizer to shame.On the drinks side, they've got a healthy cocktail list with a nice cohort of bourbon-based beverages. I went for the sweet-ish La Campesina, which came mixed with lavender honey syrup and Carpano Antica vermouth.The food and drinks, while a bit pricey, are well worth it, but the atmosphere and service here really bump the whole experience up a couple of notches. First off, there's a nice rustic-meets-classy mix of exposed tumbled marble, polished wood, and smoky mirrors that really set apart the vibe inside. Indirect lighting splashing the walls makes eating and looking around an easy task while still allowing for a dim, date-friendly spot as the night carries on. They've got a lovely back garden area beneath a retractable roof, but the inclement weather that evening kept us from getting a chance to experience the open roof. Our server Brian was spot on, food runners fully described the dishes as they came out, waters were topped off and napkins even re-folded when one of us left for the bathroom. Donald, one of the owners, made the rounds, checking up on the tables and ensuring that everyone else was having an equally positive experience.I really enjoyed dinner at Salinas, and look forward to returning when the weather heats up so we can take advantage of that open area in the back!",11,0.9964
1116,7,4,5.0,"Living in Hell's Kitchen has its pros and cons. Cons being that you're relatively close to where all the tourists are, and can be limited in the sense of subway accessibility. However, Hell's Kitchen has some amazing restaurants, including the amazing Wondee Siam. This place is the best Thai in Hell's Kitchen hands down, and possibly the best Thai that I've had in the city to date. Wondee Siam is located right on 9th Avenue, between 52nd and 53rd. It's a small little restaurant without any flashy signs, so you might accidentally miss it when walking by. The restaurant isn't large by any means, as there are only about 8 tables for people to dine at.The first time I ate here, I just ordered off of Seamless. My order showed up within 45 minutes, which it should considering I live two blocks away, and tasted amazing. I ordered a complete meal for two. This included:- Tom Yum Soup- Crispy Pork with Basil- Pad Si Ew- Wondee SamplerIn total, my meal came out, with tip, to just under $44. My meal, as expected, was damn tasty. I knew that I had to at least stop by and dine-in once to get that nice and fresh taste.My second visit was during lunch. During this time, they have a lunch special for $7.95. Your choice of entree comes with a salad and two spring rolls. What a steal! I decided to go with the pad kee mao w/pork, and an additional order of their amazing, amazing Crispy Pork with Basil. The pad kee mao noodles were cooked just how I like them. They were nice and chewy, and when mixed in with all the veggies and pork, gave off an amazing fresh taste with every bite. The salad is your typical garden salad with miso dressing, and the two springs rolls come with a side of sweet and sour dipping sauce. The absolute best, though, is the crispy pork. Pretty much, it's pork chop diced up into smaller pieces, fried with a spice, and topped off with some basil. If you decide to order anything, this is the thing to get. Hands down my favorite dish here by far. Especially for lunch, this place is an amazing bargain. For $8, you get an entree and appetizer. Not many places can offer that kind of price, married with great tasting Thai food. I've had my share of mediocre Thai in the city, as well, as across the country, and Wondee Siam is definitely a standout. Whether you decide to Seamless a meal, or stop by to dine-in, you won't be disappointed.",11,0.9962
1117,8,5,5.0,"I was expecting Kopi Kopi to be a small, dive-y coffee shop and was pleasantly surprised to find it to be a very spacious coffee lounge that also serves Indonesian food. This is one of those coffee shops where you can lounge around all day (okay, maybe not all day). The space looks like the typical Indonesian living room (minus Dutch colonial era tiles and high ceiling). I dropped by around 11am on Saturday and thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Kopi Kopi. Everyone was so friendly and genuinely excited to be there. There were 4-5 people behind the counter, which made the experience a bit hectic and confusing as we had one person taking our coffee order, another person fetching the actual coffee, and another person ringing us up.  I was so excited to learn that they serve Indonesian food, in addition to serving beverages crafted with Indonesian coffee beans. We ordered iced coffee, risoles, and soto ayam (chicken soup). Unfortunately, I made the mistake of bastardizing the iced coffee by promptly adding milk before chugging it, so I can't really speak to the quality. It's on the lighter side and not the best iced coffee I've had, but also better than Starbucks. I'll have to come back and actually enjoy the coffee next time. The risoles (an Indonesian croquette-like snack with Portuguese/Dutch roots, typically stuffed with chicken, carrots, peas, and creamy filling) are heated up in small batches, so they stay fresh, somewhat crispy on the outside and perfectly warm. The risoles is a bit small (but it's also only $1.60), so can't complain! The soto ayam (chicken soup) is simple, light and flavorful. Again, the portion is small. The dishes I've tried so far are simple Indonesian comfort food, the kind you'll find if you go over to an Indonesian friend's for dinner. I will definitely be back to retry the coffee and when I don't feel like trekking it to Elmhurst for Indonesian food.",10,0.9918

It's not exactly the classy neighborhood with a mcdonalds and crown fried chicken every 3 blocks.I am, however, extremely surprised when I enter the bar and feel like I've been transported to some microbrewery in the East Village or LES. The lighting is just right and the TVs act as distractions to those that feel like avoiding eye contact. The beer is cheap for 9% heavy hitters and these are pretty rare to find on draft even if you go to a Gingermans or DBA. The overall atmosphere is friendly and refreshing. I can even picture a fireplace in the corner if it weren't so packed with happy people.I keep coming here because the people are really friendly. I've always met interesting people when I go for a drink and it's always worked out for the best. The free popcorn is always a good touch, and I don't think the music is too loud because the sounds of laughter and chatter are louder.

The area upstairs is still under construction, but will eventually feature a tapas bar. The decor is colorful and bright, accentuated by tall windows and enormously high ceilings. The menu features soup, salad, and sandwiches. I looked forward to warming up with a bowl of soup, so I ordered the seasonal soup option, which was vegetarian potato cauliflower.

1120,12,9,5.0,"""What did you say this was again?"" I said, having waved over one of the two amiable young men serving me (and the rest of Atera's counter clientele). ""Toasted grain dashi,"" he repeated, then launched into an explanation involving kombu seaweed and CryoVacs. I loved his enthusiasm, but I wasn't listening too intently: too busy downing successive spoonfuls of the clarion broth with its pleasantly burnt notes. I was enjoying it so thoroughly that it took me a while to remember that a dumpling was still floating in it. Peekytoe crab raviolo, the server had said. Almost as an afterthought, I ate it in one bite.WHOOMP. The outer wrapping, which turned out to be an ethereally thin layer of yuba, held for a moment then dematerialized, releasing its payload of pure crab essence. Such unadulterated deliciousness! So moist! How could it manage to be even juice-laden than the soup I'd just been slurping?!I waved my server over again.The to-and-fro of this tiny dish was a microcosm for the meal as a whole. Even when the magic was partly explained (the crab had been suspended in a lobster sabayon), the food never lost its capacity to blindside and amaze. Even the one-biters could merit a paragraph. What looked like a large piece of chicharron turned out to be flash-fried dehydrated beef tendon. Gleefully salty, yes, and delivering all the simple pleasures of a pork crackling, but also so light as to almost induce a giggle. Not to mention the uni fish sauce drizzled on top, a perfectly-judged grace note of... can I say it?... umami.But I don't have space for so many paragraphs. How about synopses? Uni and sweet potato under a blizzard of Nasturtium flower petals (grown on a hydroponic farm downstairs): a gorgeous plate of oranges and yellows, pure smoothness from ground and from sea. Lobster ""roll"" where the bread was a dried yeast meringue that literally dissolved on the tongue: a New England drawing done in disappearing ink. Dry-cured Columbia River salmon with guanciale and licorice powder: salty and sweet, fish and meat. Swordfish belly coated in pork fat: aquatic bacon.I could even leave out the metaphors and just list items. Fermented leek and fluke tartare under vinegar ice. Chicken liver pate between pig's blood wafers. Beer foam/sturgeon caviar macaron. Pickled rutabaga encased in beeswax. There were 19 courses I haven't mentioned yet.Some offered recognizable pleasures. 2-week-aged squab had the toothiness and depth of, as the chef himself put it, Chinatown roast poultry... But none of my go-to Chinese spots ever put out a paired sauce like the quenelle of almost comically rich squab heart/liver ragu. A slice of raw diver scallop over ""sour"" cabbage and hazelnut butter hid a dollop of scallop roe but still hit with the elemental pleasure of top-flight nigiri.Others dishes deceived. Poached halibut dressed with a fishbone broth/buttermilk whey emulsion, soft and virgin white, managed to taste like nothing I'd ever had. Was it the chamomile oil? Does it matter? Pickled quail egg turned out to be frank, delicious fakery, an ovoid of aioli bound in milk skin. Even the butter for the breads had been steeped in Winnimere cheese. A chocolate pretzel shocked simply because... [SPOILER] there was no pretzel! Little tricks like that might've been cloying in less sure hands. But chef Lightner and his crew have nothing if not sure hands. This is serious play.Take the ""cracked egg"" dessert. Maybe you've seen plays on the fake egg before (Megu's ""raw egg"" comes to mind), but never executed so lovingly as here. A mannitol sugar shell around ice cream... but what was this ""yolk""? So glistening, so decadent?""It's yolk,"" my server said. Albeit sugar-touched and sous-vided. He delivered this revelation with a hint of a smile, the same good-natured and respectful warmth that permeates the entirety of the restaurant. Everyone there seems to believe they're part of something special, and they want you to come along.You should.Probability of return within a year: 20%; I would rather come back here than Momofuku Ko or Brooklyn Fare",12,0.9988
1121,13,9,5.0,"Sometimes the entire ""fusion"" concept can be taken too far. On the Upper West Side a few months back, some friends of mine were walking down Amsterdam, causally read a restaurant's sign and had to stop to laugh in disbelief. (French / Mexican? REALLY?) When I heard ""Korean"" ""Fried Chicken"", and ""Jazz"" in the descriptors of this establishment, I was curious, yet not ready to make fun just yet. I can't immediately knock a place that some people boast has the city's best fried chicken.One of my dearest culinary partners in crime, Aviva G., and I suggested a nice post-Christmas dinner date. In my mind, I pictured something more in the vein of a restaurant in St. Mark's Place: a below-street level restaurant with low ceilings, dim red lighting, and extremely crowded and teaming with people, the sound of hot grease sizzling in the background as the open kitchen was visible to all in the tiny space. When I arrived...I got 20 foot tall ceilings, walls lined with jars of infusing fruits and literally 30,000 records, a DJ spinning jazz tunes overlooking the huge open dining area, a gorgeous eat-around piano, and just this classy air surrounding me.Aviva and I were unsure about soju (infused Korean vodka), so we split the four flavor sampler flight: Snow White Yogurt (which tasted like melted Pinkberry), Passion Mint, Pink Lychee, and our personal favorite, Blood Orange. Blood Orange is an absolute must! (Upon our inevitable figure return, we plan on buying a large carafe of it!) Later in our meal, we each got a mojito. She got Passion Fruit. I got Pineapple Coconut. Both were perfect. The ""problem"" with both the soju and the mojitos is their lack of any alcoholic flavor! We ended up feel VERY GOOD by evening's end, needless to say. I recall saying to Aviva, ""I know I'm feeling these drinks because I'm having trouble enunciating my words,"" of course putting extra emphasis on correctly enunciating the sentence BECAUSE I knew of my then-lack of enunciation ability. (Thank you, soju and mojitos!) Next, we split the Pepper Jeon: ground beef upon red pepper slices, and grilled corn on the cob, seasoned with paprika and cojita cheese. I don't think I can ever eat corn any other way.Finally, the pièce de résistance: the fried chicken! Drumsticks and wings, double fried fresh to order, glazed in an absolutely delectable soy garlic sauce...it's the stuff dreams are made out of. This is food porn at its finest! The outside, crispy. The inside, hot and absolutely perfectly moist* The chicken that surely, unwillingly, sacrificed its life did not die in vain, I can tell you THAT much!Fusion at its finest, folks. Aviva and I are already plotting our return. We were almost speechless at points of this dining experience. AMAZING.* - I am one of ""those people"" that truly has an aversion to ""The M Word"".

1123,18,15,5.0,"I absolutely love a good beer. There is nothing like finding a pub that serves up a terrific selection of quality brews. When I found out that this new bar was taking the spot that used to house the old Brother Jimmy's location I was ecstatic. It's about time that the UES/Yorkville area is getting quality businesses up here and the Third Avenue Ale House is a much welcome addition to the hood!With the Second Ave subway coming we have recently seen an influx of new nightlife businesses open up shop around here - bars, restaurants, gastropubs, cocktail lounges, and others that are really a step up from what we normally had. I have even seen reports of more on the way too. It's getting to the point that the much maligned UES is slowly becoming a drink and foodie hot spot. There is more of a reason to stay local now and party up here rather then heading to the over-hyped LES or trekking over to the other boroughs. I just hope those who live downtown and out there stay away and don't discover what the UES has to offer nowadays or everything will become too crowded. LOL!When I dropped into this slick new beer pub I was very impressed. The old place had become decrepit and worn down. I had my fun times in that old bar but it just lost appeal as my beer tastes became more refined. The new pub has an outstanding selection of domestic and imported craft beers - around 30 on tap! Atlantic Brewing Co, Blue Boint, Bear Republic, Flying Dog, Oskar Blues, Carton Brewing, Brooklyn Brewery, Founders, Great Divide, Green Flash, Ommegang, Mahrs Brau Christmas Bock, Lagunitas, Ithaca, Sierra Nevada, Harpoon Cider, Schmaltz, and so many more that I can't recall. The bartender Louis was a friendly gent and was easy on letting me try a few samples which he gave me in a cool mini mug. I went with that Christmas Bock and it was outstanding. The pints run in the $7-$10 range which is a little pricey but these are quality beers here, and I don't mind paying a extra buck or two to enjoy the nice environment. They also have a selection of cans and bottled beer, along with some special reserved bottles and a featured can. If you are into the harder spirits they have on hand a very nice Scotch, Whiskey, Tequila, and Bourbon list along with a small selection of wines. Happy hour 4-8.The decor is very manly-like with mostly dark woods, exposed brick walls, copper roof, and designer lighting. Plenty of seating in the bar area with about four or five flat screens. There is a large back room with even more seating and a large flat screen on the wall. Nice dimly lit ambiance when I was there, candlelit, and some great tunes playing from Led Zepplin to a mix of old rock. The owners did a wonderful job renovating this spot to give it appeal to attract beer lovers, to those on dates, to people hanging out for a night, to those who want a bite to eat, and anyone else dropping in. Right now they are waiting for Con Ed to hook up their gas and power to the kitchen so they have a limited menu, but it's still a nice eclectic mix of food items. I had one of their soft pretzels and this thing was delicious. Came out big, hot, moist, fluffy, with a nice seasoned crispiness on the outside. The inside was filled with gooey cheese! Oh my! Also served with dried chorizo slices and deli mustard. I spoke with one of the owners and he told me they will be pumping up the menu to have more choices once they are fully operational, and brunch too. I spoke with a few of the staff and everyone seemed very friendly and attentive.Before I left I was treated to a beer on the house. A nice touch as a way of welcoming me to what will become one of my favorite new spots to down a pint. It's right up the block from where I live, which might be dangerous to my diet and waist line! It will be a locals favorite around here for sure. It's already one of mine and I'm heading over for a beer there shortly!",28,0.999
1124,8,4,5.0,"This place was fantastic. My 2 friends and I came here for dinner on a Monday night. It was snowing/rainy, and right when we arrived, someone greeted us and took our coats. Loved the attentiveness.We ordered the baby beets to start. I'm usually not a fan of beets but this was one of those exceptions. I had heard great things about the spaghetti but decided to go with the short rib agnolotti because I wanted some meat. My friends ordered the spaghetti and red snapper. I tried both dishes and thought they were great. And I thought the agnolotti was fantastic.The bread was also a highlight. They brought out 2 types of bread (plain and bread with meat rolled within it) with a nice array of spreads (olive oil, eggplant, butter?).Meal came out to about $55 per person including tax and tip. This included drinks (I ordered a pear cocktail which I thought was very good). Will return.",12,0.9836
1125,8,11,5.0,"If the words HOT, STICKY, and MEAT make your juices start flowing...you either love beef jerky or are a dirty pervert who needs to get their mind out of the gutter. I stumbled on this place accidentally while wondering around Chinatown and was attracted by the displayed of different types of grilled beef jerky. Pork and beef options in both spicy and mild flavors. This is different than what comes in the bags you buy at the 7-eleven. The meat here is tenderized and grilled which gives it a smokey and toasty flavor that compliments that caramelized glazed that each piece of meat is soaked in. It's perfect as a snack on its own or chopped and served over rice. Check it out for something different and unique",9,0.7096
1126,17,15,5.0,"""Be careful, it's extremely hot.""  - our servers each time they brought out a plate of food.I always like to hear this when eating out. There's nothing worse than getting some lukewarm food, and everything we got that was supposed to be served hot was piping hot, very fresh, and extremely delicious.The food here is incredible. They start you off with the Complimentary Ciabatta with whipped blue cheese. I started to wonder why it was taking awhile for the bread to come out, but when it finally did, I realized it was because they were baking it fresh, and it was well worth it. This was some of the best complimentary bread I've had recently.For starters, we got the Caramelized Chicken Wings ($7), which were pretty good, though I'm not really into chicken wings so much. We also got the House made Refrigerator Pickles and Butter Roasted Peanuts ($5). This was the only mild disappoint out of everything we ordered. The pickles were actually quite refreshing to offset all of the fried, heavy stuff, but the peanuts were not great - they were surprisingly flavorless and could have used some salt.But the main entrees and sides are where this place really shines. We got the Cherrywood Burger ($21), which is really just a fancy Big Mac. This is the only time I think I've ever seen a double burger at a fancier place, and it was delicious. The best part of this dish though was the side it came with, the French Fry Ends with Bacon Crumble. This was a genius alternative to the typical side of regular fries. It's served in a little that you should get a spoon to scoop up, to get a salty, delicious mouthful of those fries and bacon. So good. If you don't get the burger, make sure you order this as a side.For the other entree, we got the Eel Stuffed Chicken (!) ($26). I've definitely never seen such a thing before, and it was amazing. Eel and chicken, together at last. At first glance, it just looks like some really good chicken with some deliciously crispy skin. But then once you cut into it, you realize there is a very generous layer of deliciously buttery eel stuffed between the chicken and its skin. This dish comes with a small side of pretty tasty vegetables, but the real way to go is to order the side of Bone Marrow Clay Pot Rice ($8). As I mentioned above, everything here is served nice and hot, but I actually managed to burn myself on this dish (but that's a good thing). This was a very generous portion of piping hot sticky rice with some bits of bone marrow scattered on top. This was the perfect complement to the deliciously rich chicken and eel.As usual at places that happen to be very good, even though we were extremely stuffed, we just had to get something for dessert since everything else we ate was so good. We opted for the interesting sounding Crunch and Munch Crumble Pie ($10). This was a hot, gooey, very satisfying pie, with a buttery crispy crust. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough of it. Also, it could have used a nice side of ice cream to offset the heat and extreme sweetness of the pie. But still, this was an awesome dessert and I would happily get it again.The atmosphere in here is very nice too, and the service is impeccable. This place is great, and I hope they take off and get the success they deserve with such good food. I will definitely be back soon to try the ribs, which everybody else here seemed to be getting and which looked just as delicious and satisfying as everything else we ate here.",19,0.9995
1127,9,6,5.0,"So I went back to Club A this past friday after scoring another Groupon deal. Thank goodness for Groupon b/c it helped confirm that I am indeed in love w/ Club A Steakhouse. From the minute we stepped inside where we were greeted by a lovely hostess, and then brought to our table right in front of the fireplace (as was requested and so kindly met) by Bruno- the owner, we were again in love. The downstairs room in which we were sat was a beautiful red, with many black and whites on the walls and a warm fireplace at the end. It reminded me of Strip House but better!Overall, the service was great. Our waiter was attentive, friendly and courteous, and everyone that brought our food or serviced us in other ways was extremely professional and personable. The food (2 filet mignons - 1 medium rare and 1 medium, mac & cheese, garlic fries, bacon and calamari) were all extremely good, and we were both happy that our steaks were cooked to perfection. Being a steak lover, there's nothing more annoying than ordering a medium rare steak only to get it medium. At Club A Steakhouse, though, they did it just right.After this second visit, I believe that this will now be our go-to steakhouse. It's classy, tasty, friendly, warm, not too loud, and everything else that I could want when I want a nice, intimate steak dinner. Bonus points to for them allowing you to bring your own bottle! They have a nice selection of wine, but since the hubby and I have grown quite the collection of nice wines, we figured we'd bring our own and make it feel that much more special.Thanks Club A for a wonderful friday night and for being everything that we could ask for.",12,0.9982
1128,9,10,5.0,"There are two things that are abundantly clear.1) The Tokyo fish market is a surreal place that must be visited at least once your life.2) The airline industry is out of control and makes #1 very difficult.Lucky for NYC, there is a restaurant that brings the same quality, traditions, and experience of a real fish-market-side restaurant to Midtown. Just to be clear, this isn't your 50% off sushi joint from Brooklyn, so don't expect to get away with a $30 check. My bill for 2 at the end of the night was more than I spent for dinner at Morimoto. Nevertheless, this was unlike any other Japanese dining experience I've had, Morimoto included, and that experience fits the bill like a glove.For a genuine experience, you will want to get a place at the bar where you food will be served out to you on a long paddle by a team of chefs who sit on their knees awaiting your order. There is an extensive drink menu, but the one I recommend is the lychee martini. Plan on ordering at least 2. There is also a nice selection of soju and sake. I also recommend starting out with a sushi roll or two. I can honestly say without a single 1/1000 degree of exaggeration that this is the freshest and the best tasting sushi I have ever had. Second best was in Aruba. This was the best. First best. I think by now, you are seeing why you can't just order one of something. For my entree, I ordered the sea bass. I was expecting a big entree plate with some jasmine rice, side of veggies, and the fish. Nope. Close your eyes and put yourself in the Tokyo fish market. You point to a fish, they salt it, stick it on a skewer, and broil it. No heat lamps. Fresh fish turned into broiled/cooked fish, on plate, coming to a paddle near you. Surreal - presentation, taste, experience, everything. And it's simple. No complicated flavor infusions or molecular gastronomy here. A meal at Inakaya would not be complete without an order (or two) of green tea mochi, freshly pounded on premise with a side of real red beans and vanilla ice cream. It's safe to say that I'll be back here again before I take a trip to Tokyo, unless the airline industry eases up or I win the lottery.",21,0.995
1129,6,3,5.0,"Seriously could not be happier with my new Warby Parker specs & overall experience at this location.First off, I had no idea WP existed in soho, let alone their actual headquarters. The space is ultra trendy, clean, and thoughtfully designed/organized. The showroom is smaller than one in the meatpacking but it does not get as hectic so there's plenty of room to walk around, try on some glasses, and have an associate at your side when you need him/her.Their collection is fantastic, super fashionable, and AFFORDABLE. I bought frames for $95 and added ""ultra thin index lenses"" (for the non-coke bottle look, since my prescription is so high) for $30, totaling to $125. For glasses. It's unreal. You can't even get that price at a Costco.Glasses ship in exactly 7 business days which is just the cherry on top of an excellent eyewear service.Definitely going to ""splurge"" on another pair since I'm thrilled about the ones I'm wearing now & of course, when you buy a pair WP gives a pair to someone in need (see how it works: warbyparker.com/do-good#…).

1130,7,0,5.0,"I have been here a lot. This is one of my favorite bars in the West Village. The bar is decorated in an eclectic homey way. Old wooden picture frames, candles, mason jar vases, and a nice brick wall with hanging window panes. I love the decor here. The place is welcoming and warm. The style of seating is shared, and often times you will be sitting at a large communal booth with other bar goers. I like this. The food menu is small, but the grilled cheese is mighty. The bar menu is typical (though they do have a pretty impressive craft beer selection), the service is average. This place is always crowded, so coming early is key if you want a seat of a place. The crowd is laid back 20 somethings. Great place for a date, to hang with a group of friends, or to hit up for happy hour. If you come here too late though, it can get too crowded.",13,0.9886
1131,6,5,5.0,"ADHD: Fine dining dress-up atmosphere. Great food and service, perfect for business, date, or parents. Sit farther back in the atrium. Great by-the-glass wine list in case you're on Flu meds and don't want a bottle.Atmosphere; This is the old Cru and is quite elegant. A lot of men wore jackets. I came business casual straight from work and felt fine, but I can completely see how others might prefer to be dressed up. It's a modern atmosphere. The old restaurant here was French modern and the decor is comparable. The place is long and skinny in shape. This is why I prefer the back room. Also, you can have large groups here. They appear to understand quite well how to make these work.  I can see this being a fine place for a business meeting, though tables are intimately close and you can definitely hear conversations at the tables next to you. While this is a great place for a date, I also think it would be the perfect place if your parents were in town. The crowd is really mixed. I want to say it's ""midtown"", but I could see UES and well heeled downtown coming here mid-week for a date. I can't see this place being a pre-party spot, but then you'd blend if you were in that mode, so I wouldn't rule it out.Service: Outstanding. People were available but not overly attentive. The waiter really knew the menu and answered all spotlessly. Kudos.Grub: There is an extensive and wonderful menu. I start with Vino because why not. It was a Tuesday, so we were by the glass. Plus I had just taken my flu medicine. I had the 2010 Barbera. I oddly knew this bottle going in so was happy to see it as an option. The other by the glass wines are 2004, 2005, 2009's all great Italian wine years. I love this because so many Italian restaurants will fail to indicate the years on the ""by the glass"" list and you end up drinking bad wine by the glass.A complementary amuse bouche arrived once we ordered. On this particular evening it was Arangini di Riso, which my perma Yelp Italian List co-pilot Mr. T informed me was a very Italian constant in his home growing up meaning orange-sized ball of rice. Orange-sized ball of happiness might be more appropriate. YUMMMY! So delicious was the amuse bouche, I could not wait for the courses to arrive. The menu is seasonal so this review is for the winter 2013. I had the tomato and cucumber salad. Mr. T had the Crispy salad. Both were simply and delightfully executed. Its winter so you need to give the body fuel to warm itself. We therefore ordered the beef and veal meatballs. Very recommended.I had the Rigatoni with sausage, which at $22 is one of the more affordable dishes on the menu. I was being treated, but it was exactly what I wanted and I recommend it highly. It was slightly on the oily side. Come on... there's sausage. How can it be otherwise!!. Mr. T had the codfish which was quite delectable.Dessert was wonderful. Mr. T demanded the Fresh mix berries ""zabaione"". While I've never had this before to judge, I watched Mr. T lick the glass clean, so I think it was really good. The sorbet selection was divine. YUM.Definitely give it a try.",9,0.9986

1133,8,7,5.0,"I am fiercely loyal to my taco tuesday venue which is Hop Devil Grill. But my friends encouraged me to try this place for taco tuesday so I decided to give it a try. And I do not regret it at all. I cant really compare the two. It's like apples and oranges. Reunion bar's taco tuesday is compeletely different. In a good way.Reunion is a tiki style bar by times square. The entrance is kind of shady, it is downstairs inthis random building. As you step inside, you suddenly feel like you are at a bar by the beach in Santa Monica! There are surf boards on the walls, the tv monitors are showing surf videos and also ski and snowboard videos, there is a tiki bar, and everything is totally beachy! Their happy hour is 6-8 pm. On tuesdays, their tacos are 3 dollars. I always get the michealada. It is by far one of the best drinks I have ever had in my mouth. It has hot sauce, lime juice, and I think mezcal? It is soooo refreshing and spicy! The glasses are also rimmed with this amazing chili salt that I lick like a puppy licking his food bowl. And yes, my friends and I dream about this drink all day at work wishing and waiting for 5 o clock to come so that we can run to Reunion! They also have this drink called the Paloma which is also really good. Its tequila and grapejuice. Also really refreshing. They also serve this argentinian beer which was tasty.The tacos.... mmmmmmm good! The choices are mahi mahi (fish tacos are soo hard to find in manhattan), pork belly, and zuchinni. I have only tried the mahi mahi and they are orgasmic. Delectable white fish. great batter, not too much, with some coleslaw and shredded carrots and this sauce that is just as tasty. All of that in this fried pita shell.. Really unusual for a taco but man it works!!! I have yet to tryt he zuchinni but it also has rave reviews from all of the my friends.

1134,6,3,5.0,"By the end of our meal, my husband and I were giggling with joy. No, we weren't drunk. (Well, maybe a little.) We were in love. With the food.Being contrarians, we did not start with the eponymous bone marrow app. We shared a salad dressed in pumpkin seed vinaigrette (lovely, but wished there was more cambozola blue cheese) and the lamb ribs. The latter had been brined (they call it ""lightly sauerbratened""), making them unbelievably flavorful and tender. There was not enough of the creamy caraway yogurt underneath, sadly.Duck schnitzel! Beautifully fried and moist, it came with classic accompaniments: spaetzle, cucumber/potato salad, and wolfberries. (Are they goji berries, but with a cooler name?) My husband ordered the falling-apart-tender short ribs pizzaiola (sp?) from the other side of the menu. With a pool of polenta and greens underneath, and a red sauce on top, this combo of hearty flavors was super-satifying.We were stuffed, but we felt it our duty to try the ginger-stout cake and the berliners. While the doughnuts were lovely, that cake was the best damn dessert we've had in ages, really deep flavors, perfect for the season. And that's when the giggling began.The service here is a treat: intelligent, professional, perfectly coordinated, and devoid of gimmickry and pretense. (The one exception was the blank-faced hostess who seemed so mournful that I nearly asked if she was ok.)For the record, we loved the crazy wallpaper.

I highly recommend to get $40 table seat instead of $30 bar seat it's a night and day difference!!! There is a $25 min charge for food and drink order and although the venue's primary focus is the music, the food wasn't bad at all. I particularly enjoyed the oysters and burrata, get those for the appetizers! If you want to meet the artist, then this is THE PLACE!! You have a high chance of meeting him in person! I not only got to meet Erwin and got him to sign my CD and had pictures taken with him, but also I got to meet his famous soprano girlfriend Anna Netrebko! Many opera royalties including his GF, Anita Rachvelishvili, Olga Peretyatko, Michele Mariotti, and Placido Domingo's brother were sitting nearby our table which was almost surreal.

There is also a park down the street you can sit and enjoy your dessert at.The lines can get very long but most of the time they do move fast so know what you want and have your cash ready. On weekends and holidays there can be a lot of tourists that ask to try all the different flavors so it holds up the line -- so if you don't want to deal with that then go M-Th like I do.They sell the scoops in cones, cups, or different size ""jugs""(quart, pint) to take home; and they other items too, i.e. toppings. My favorite flavors so far have been:- black sesame- mango- taro- lychee- avocado- pistachio- almond cookieThe only flavor I didn't really ""care for"" was the red bean, but that was ONLY because the actual read beans they put in the ice cream were rock solid when I was trying to bite into the causing too much of a texture issue when trying to eat it.

1141,15,10,5.0,"Cheese is my version of crack. There I said it. I'm a bit obsessed. When I got word that one of my favorite cheese shops (I'm looking at you Murray's) were opening an actual Cheese Bar and serving wine with this goodness, I could not wait to head over to Bleecker and try it! If you're at all into wine and cheese you must, must, must try this place! However, and I may regret actually typing the next words into the same sentence but here goes: it was almost too much cheese. I know, I know that sounds ridiculous, especially for a place known specifically for it's cheese. It would be a crime to not have dishes covered in gooey cheese, cheese compliments and cheese sauces... but it is a lot. So in an attempt to avoid the cheese overload I think you need to approach Murray's Cheese Bar in one of the following ways and you will be guaranteed to have a practically perfect evening*: 1) The Pre-Event Cheese Plate and Wine This can be done either at the bar or a larger table with friends, colleagues, family in town, or a date. Basically, you are simulating the old school at home Murray's experience that you know and love and kicking it up a notch. This is done by sitting at the actual bar and having an entire wine menu to choose from instead of relying on what you're friend has in her apartment. Also, you have the more vibrant feeling of being at the wine bar and if you're with work friends or on a date you don't have to worry if you're apartment is clean enough to host a wine and cheese party. You can enjoy the excellent service, sip your wine (just a glass or if you're like me split a bottle), and take in the buzzing atmosphere. The have plenty of options are far as cheese plates are concerned, or take it one step farther and do an assortment of meats and cheeses. Everyone here is fully qualified to help you select cheese to your heart's content. You will be in a lovely mood to head to the next stop on your night's agenda. 2) The Main Event Cheese Lover Dinner This is when you make Murray's your main event. This one works especially well on a weeknight or when you want something more low key. You should probably also bring along fellow cheese loving companions. The menu itself is pretty cheese heavy, and in this case I would not suggest a cheese plate before your meal. I had and loved the Buffalo Cheese Curds (I am from Buffalo and this was a taste of home for me - very authentic), roasted beets with whipped chevre and sea salt, grilled artichoke hearts, and the Murray's melt. The later is a gooey grilled cheese accompanied by tasty tomato soup for dipping. You can even add bacon if you like. We tried the buratta too, but I wasn't as impressed.3) The Post-Dinner Cheese as Dessert So you've just finished dinner in the West Village and you're not quite ready to go home yet? You still want a nightcap and a couple of bites of cheese to go with it? Here's your spot! Open till midnight Wed - Sat and 10pm Sun - Tues, Murray's is ideal. They even offer a cheese dessert plate.4) Celebratory Cheese and Wine with a GroupThere is a large table in the front of the restaurant which would be idea for a group gathering, for the pre, post, or main event. *Well, unless of course you are choosing to head there with losers, douchbags, or annoying unfriendly types... then you're on your own. Good luck to you.",19,0.9979

I KNEW I WAS IN LOVE...WITH THEIR BRISKET!!!HOLY MIGHTY QUINN BARBECUE, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE!????That being said upon further discussion I've decided that everything was AMAZING and really 'up there' for me in terms of BBQ flavor, quality, value, etc - however the award for Best Brisket EVER (for me, personally) still goes to Hill Country. But Mighty Quinn's brisket is a very, VERY close 2nd for me completely blowing out places like Blue Smoke and Dinosaur BBQ out of the water!Each bite of their brisket was insanely juicy, tender, flavorful and the burnt ends were simply ORGASMIC. They have an amazing Hawaiian sea salt on each table in a stylish metal grinder and this complimented each meat were ordered perfectly. Their in-house made BBQ sauce is also delicious, not too thick and gloopy (which I'm not a fan of) but instead a nice opaque consistency that doesn't overpower the meat and still lets other flavors stand out, all I needed was some acidic/vinegar-y sauces available and I would have been more in heaven.Now, brisket is by far one of my favorite meat offerings EVER - but allow me to elaborate on the other meats we annihilated:*** The smoked sausage was delicious, perfectly cooked, juicy and all that good stuff. It was a little spicy (for my tastes) but still really friggin' good. *** The pulled pork was delicious but could have been more seasoned...or perhaps seasoned with more interesting things...I'm Hispanic, where I come from pernil is all the rage and it's seasoned differently so obviously this is all subjective, but it was still fantastic!The sides were also enjoyed by everyone - I have to note that I'm not normally a baked bean fan, but Mighty Quinn's baked beans were pretty damn Delicious! Far superior than any other baked beans I've ever had at any similar establishment. My one HUGE disappointment was the lack of potatoes. I mean REAL potatoes, not that ""mashed sweet potato"" crap, I mean like pomme frites or even better some garlic/rosemary/thyme seasoned roasted potato CHUNKS.In all fairness and for full disclosure purposes, they did have ""Pomme Frites"" on their menu with a strip of paper across it that said, ""Coming Soon!"" but soon was not last night and I was VERY disappointed that something like ANY OTHER SIDE was considered before potatoes which pair PERFECTLY with meat. To me it's the equivalent of going to a Wine and Cheese place and being told that the cheese is ""coming soon!"" and being offered crackers instead - sure, it's yummy and not bad together, but not prioritized? Not cool. I know I was not the only person there last night who felt cheated having to eat meat without potatoes.Their beer selection is interesting and not incredibly diverse, but still a good mix with something for everyone plus other beverages for those who aren't into pairing their BBQ with alcoholic libations.Also, I'd like to note that on our way out I took my canvas tote bag with me and mistakenly left my (really nice looking) Coach cross-body strapped hobo bag (for the guys out there, this means it's a big, pricey sorta designer bag with plenty of interior room!) on the chair I occupied during dinner and one of the guys that worked there literally ran out of the restaurant shouting, arms flailing to get our attention so that he could return my bag with all my belongings intact...that simple kind action is what took a 4-4.5 star dining experience straight to a 5. I suppose there's no sense in being so upset by the lack of potatoes since they did note that they were in fact ""coming soon"".If you're coming with a group (or on a date, this place is TOTALLY date-worthy) then I would suggest calling ahead and making a reservation. My party and I only waited about 5-6 minutes for a table, but I could easily see things getting pretty crazy here during peak eating hours. I seriously can't wait to come back here and enjoy more food, Mighty Quinn's is mighty awesome :),",17,0.9993
1143,15,11,5.0,"45 DAY DRY AGED PORTERHOUSE ! Need I say more?I went here a while ago, and never got around to reviewing this place. If you're going to go to a David Burke restaurant you have to go all or nothing for the best experience. Therefore, I opted for the PORTERHOUSE. While, it may seem a little pricey at $110 it really isn't. It serves 2 people and comes with 2 sides. It was extremely filling and the presentation was very professional and beautiful. Dining at it's finest! The establishment is pretty fancy and VERY spacious. There's a rooftop bar that seemed really cool but there was a private event going on that night. I'd like to go back and check it out. Highly recommend this place for a special occasion (birthday, anniversary, engagement, etc...) It's sure to impress and food is top-notch.",17,0.978
1144,15,17,5.0,"I love you CoCo! You made my days at Baruch that much brighter--especially when I brought unsuspecting bubble tea virgins who then choked on the tapioca, despite my warnings.This place is nice and bright. The staff always had a smile when my friends and I came in, and they were helpful when I, too, was a bubble tea virgin and unsure of what to get. I always got the milk tea whenever I went. My favorite was with the caramel. I brought my friend from London here, and she got something with mango. It was pretty good, but I feel like I'm committing bubble tea blasphemy if I don't get my regular caramel milk tea. I love that everything is fresh. The tapioca is the perfect size, and it's tolerable. There used to be a bubble tea place near my home and their tapioca was gross. But the best? The best was when my friends and I stopped by on a Friday night. We were clearly drunk off our asses (yea happy hour!), and instead of getting all huffy and annoyed because we were taking too long to order, the people at the counter were laughing at us. The place was empty at the time that we came in, so I guess we were their entertainment for the night? Bubble tea is 500x better when you're drunk. Try it next time you're near this place. Just don't choke on the tapioca. Seriously, that stuff is dangerous if you're not expecting it.I am long overdue for a visit. Gotta find a bubble tea virgin to bring along for the laugh.",17,0.9957
1145,7,3,5.0,"Takashi is my new favorite restaurant in NY. It's absolutely amazing for those of you who are looking for something adventurous and off the beaten path. It's also a super fun date spot if you're looking to impress a foodie who has tried it all. Who would have though that raw meat would be so decadent and addicting...?Here's what I usually get:RAW: Niku-Uni - uni (sea urchin) on top of raw chuck, shiso leaf, and seaweed. This is probably one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten. I actually insisted on ordering two orders last time I was here. I think it would be on the short list of things that I'd want to eat if I only had one more meal on earth. Yooke - thinly-sliced chuck eye tartare with raw quail egg yoke. The waiter pours out the egg yoke from the tiny little speckled shell and mixes it into the tartare, The first time I tried this, I was a bit skeptical. Despite the beautiful presentation, it looked a bit like little mound of ground beef with a tiny egg on top. My skepticism was disarmed at first bite and now I order it every time I'm back. Delicious! GRILLED:Horumon-Moriawase (chef's selection) - if you want to try unusual cuts, go with this. It typically comes with sweetbread, liver, heart, and two types of stomach. My favorite was the heart because it was super tender with the sweetbread in a close second. The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was one of the stomachs because it was too rubbery. Definitely ask the server how long each cut should be cooked because that will have a large impact on how it tastes. They're happy to cook it for you as well. SAKE:Hakkaisan from Niigota - dry, crisp, and delicious. When you order sake, they bring out a tray of all different cute little cups for you to choose from.",18,0.9923
1146,5,14,5.0,"erhhmmyygawwddd I die cuz this place is so amazingly good. When people say finger licking good...it actually applies to The Boil! I've wanted to try this place since it opened and finally did after our Texas friends were insistent that we had to go!We had planned to go at 7:45 but like we all were late or ""on time"" in NYC terms. Good thing Jimmy C. went early and put down our names! Since they call you when your table is ready, we went across the street and grabbed a couple of drinks while we waited. We were seated around 8:30pm in the back past the bar. There was a chalkboard behind our table that myself and my girlfriends felt no hesitation in vandalizing. We left the ordering to the Texans and found ourselves elbows deep in pounds and pounds of crawfish, clams, oysters and crab. The sauce is honestly the best thing I've ever had in my mouth. Seriously there's probably tons and tons of butter but I don't care! We dipped everythang in that sauce. To be honest though...the crawfish weren't my favorite! It's just so much work for so little meat! I loved the crab and clams though and even the potatoes, sausage and corn tasted 12837219837x better with that crack sauce.Ugh, if only it was bigger and the wait wasn't so long!

1147,12,8,5.0,"Fukurou opened in late December of 2012, to remarkably little fanfare. As the first stateside venture of one of Tokyo's more prominent restaurant chains, I was surprised by the complete lack of publicity surrounding its arrival. However, I was also thrilled, as it meant that simply walking in late one evening was actually possible, a frustrating rarity in Manhattan.On the night Nancy and I came, a few weeks ago, about 80% of the other patrons were Japanese, and many seemed to be friends of the staff. In other words, the restaurant still seems to be something of a secret. Our server almost looked bemused in handing us our menus. The owls perched along the counter top and general atmosphere of joviality in the kitchen did little to dissuade his or our smiles. As it was early February, and New York seemed hellbent on making up for lost time with regards to its not so frigid winter, we elected to start with some sake to warm ourselves. The sake menu is surprisingly varied, and positively affordable. Our tokubetsu junmai was only eighteen dollars, as was nearly every other type of sake, and when it came in a bamboo stalk serving as a carafe, it only felt like more of a bargain. The fact that they have an Asahi kegerator and the fact that they don't mark up the drafts to exorbitant levels is icing on the imbibing cake. Soon after we poured our first masus(just kidding, it's so rare to see those silly wooden boxes anymore) of sake, our first plate was placed before us: the Seared Fatty Salmon. Seared was in this case being rather generous with the term. The fish appeared to have scarcely glanced the pan, and I mean that as no disrespect. The salmon was 95% raw, and was all the better for it. The searing of each edge was enough only form the most delicate of crusts. The sprouts topping the salmon probably had more of a crunch to them, but that is how the dish was meant to be. The crisp freshness of the vegetables, combined with their innate vibrance as sprouts was a wonderful foil to the fattiness of the fish and the saltiness of its marinade. If our next dish had not been set down in such a timely manner, I would have contemplated scraping my chopsticks along the plate to ensure that we had gotten everything. But once our next dish was presented, the aroma made it difficult to think of anything else. The Zuru Teba, liberally seasoned and ran through with skewers, were so tempting that Nancy and I forewent the appropriate, dignified approach of gently sliding out each skewer, letting the meat come off with it, and instead brutishly yanked them out and ate with our hands. Our server came back with napkins, chuckling all the while. In truth, the wings are so tender that one's approach to eating them is largely irrelevant. At the culmination of your efforts, you'll find the same lemony, garlicky, salty, slightly sweet morsels of chicken no matter what means you took to reach them. Our next two plates were brought to us simultaneously, although it was unclear if that stemmed from the fact that they both were pork-centric, or from the fact that we were eating at a comical pace. Both the Grilled Black Pork Belly and Stewed Black Pork Belly on sight alone looked to be winners, but upon tasting, the stewed version was far superior. The grilled version was cooked a bit too long, and was a little tougher than it should have been. It also did not retain much flavor from its miso marinade, likely another unfortunate side effect of too much time on the grill. The stewed version, however, was rich, smoky, meaty comfort at its best. The soft boiled eggs melded with the remaining broth, rendering the fare even more substantial. The shavings of scallion did little to convince me that I wasn't spooning my way towards an early heart attack, but I loved every moment of it. The final number in our swift succession of plates was the Taro Korokke; two fried balls of mashed potato (sweet potato in this case) filled with ground beef, and on this occasion, a bit of carrot as well. The breading was light and crispy, and the filling was nowhere near as dense as a typical korokke. The kewpie mayo and diced tomato that accompanied them was a nice touch. In short, Nancy and I enjoyed nearly everything about Fukurou. It was unpretentious, almost universally delicious, uncrowded, and supremely inexpensive. And to boot, we only sampled perhaps a quarter of the menu. In my selfishness, I hope this restaurant stays lost in translation.",15,0.9976
1148,31,20,5.0,"The Eleven Madison Park experience is unbeatable in New York. It is not so much the surfeit of food or even the consistency of quality that impresses as much as the ambiance, the attention and the accouterments that render an interesting twist to the mechanics of meal-making. Not to forget my delightful company--no, that is not a reference to Mister Hanks who was holding court at the next table to ours as only an aged version of Josh Baskin can.What pleased me also was that Eleven Madison Park has such staff in their employ as a 'wine director' and a 'bar manager'--when you pay for an expensive meal, you like to know that the restaurant is splurging as well. Equally pleasing was their ability to cater to a vegetarian palate in a surprisingly seamless manner, matched only by their desire to pamper and please every patron.The sixteen-course meal had its statistically inevitable ups and downs. The black and white cookie, the squash, roasted salsify with wheat and walnuts, the baked potato and the parsnip roasted with sesame and parsley are fresh in the mind's eye, ably complemented by a printed menu that I hope to preserve at least until the next time I move apartments. The most impressive item in the series of desserts was the Maple--bourbon barrel aged with milk and shaved ice. I wish they gave us more of that to take home rather than the granola, but I am not complaining--they were quite generous about giving us two bottles of the granola for the road.This was only my second time at the restaurant, and the new team seems to have done a magnificent job of preserving what was essentially right while tweaking or transforming other elements of the experience. I hope to be back soon!",37,0.9901

Pouring Ribbons continues the rise of Alphabet City as a cocktail destination. At this point, there are more top-tier quality bars just on Avenue B and C then some neighborhoods have in entirety. With the Wayland, Summit Bar, Elsa and the like, Pouring Ribbons joins great company.The cocktails. Holy !?@!. I really don't know what else to say. This bar is instantly in New York's top 10. Fantastic list where every cocktail is plotted on a 4 criteria grid between Spiritous, Comforting, Refreshing and Boozy, which is a fantastic aide for those who are not cocktail nerds (like me). The Lust for Life is like the Mezcal cocktail for people who don't know Mezcal. Mezcal is smoky, but in this drink it's been subdued and restrained to a more subtle accent. Combined with Pineapple, Sherry (adds umami), Orgeat (Almond syrup) then topped with cacao for aromatics, and you have a wonderfully balanced, layered drink.Joaquin also served me the Tropic of Cancer on recommendation knowing I like funky stirred drinks. With Chile-Infused Tequila, Coffee Infused Carpano Antica (sweet vermouth like) and Bitters, this is basically a complex riff on a Manhattan. And it's amazing.

1152,25,21,5.0,"The owner, Orhan Yegen, gets an 'A' for differentiation, presentation, and pricing.... and, sadly for Attitude as well!Starting from the name that doesn't include any reference to Turkey, the name of a city, or of a municipality in Turkey, to the cool ambience that reminds one of a Mediterranean bistro - Sip Sak declares itself different and captures one's attention all the way through.The menu changes frequently, and having dined on close to half a dozen occasions across Summer, Fall, and pre-winter (ok, still Fall), I've had the pleasure of eating different dishes that stay true to their Turkish roots, but still remain accessible to the dining population of mid-town (I am not saying clueless, but let's not forget this is still Turtle Bay, only a notch up from Murray Hill...).It's safe to try anything eggplant. From the refreshing and cool fried eggplant cubes with tomato and garlic to the moussaka, or the smoky eggplant salad - they are uniformly well executed. The Hot Yogurt soup is popular for good reason, and the char-grilled octopus, sizzling shrimp, Sigara Boregi with the tangy cheese are all thrilling. Presentation is different and so even though you'll be eating the Lamb Adana (listed under Spicy Hand Chopped Lamb Kebab), also available at dozen of Turkish restaurants, the inter-play of seasonings and textures (fried pita, onions with sumac) all enhance the experience. It's unlikely that you would have had anything like the ground lamb and rice filled cabbage rolls or the baked green lentils with ground lamb at another Turkish restaurant.The bread is baked on premises, and unlike the Lavash served at other restaurants, the Pide is fluffy, usually warm, and coated with Nigella seeds. The desserts might be the usual fare, but the Baklava is nuttier than most versions you would have tried, and my favorite, the almond pudding is the lightest, silkiest, airiest - almost mousse like concoction I've had in the city.... I've tried 15 different versions, and while they hold back on the almonds compared to Beyoglu or A La Turka - would be the one I find the best in the city.The price points are excellent. Only one dish is pricier than $ 25, and this is achieved with a keen sense of balancing portion sizes: so, not all dishes are meze, but the sizes aren't such that you'll ever leave Sip Sak feeling stuffed. Service is usually great. There is a sense of urgency, even fear, while the volatile owner looks on, which may lead to another server following up with you for dessert, when you had just placed an order with another one. I'm willing to cut them slack, for it's a unique dining experience.",32,0.9951

Growing up in Seattle, I've had more than my fair share of incredible Asian food.  Jordan S's review of this place caught my attention. Made a reservation via OpenTable and they only had an early dinner slot (6ish). I'm glad I made that reservation, the place was packed! .... And it seems that everyone also had a reservation. When I heard about Pig & Khao, I was picturing a haute bourgeouise Asian Fusion place with ridiculous prices. I was surprised to see how reasonable prices are. $1 beer 5-7pm and $15 all-you-can-drink self-serve draft?! Are we still in Manhattan?! I wanted to order just about everything on the menu because almost everything had some sort of pork in it (and I can never say no to pork). Exercising some self-control to save room for the halo-halo, my fiance and I decided to order the pork jowl salad, pork rinds, sizzling sisig (pork head), and coconut rice. I went back and forth on wanting to also order the crispy pata (comparing pictures on foursquare and Yelp for a few minutes), but glad that I didn't. The portion is pretty filling. The pork jowl ""salad"" was very refreshing. Pretty sure there was ZERO veggies in there other than the cilantro. This is definitely how all salad should look like: with pork rinds on top. It was tasty and they put just enough fish sauce to add an interesting taste to the mix without the overpowering fishy smell. The pork rinds were perfectly seasoned and peppery. Don't be afraid to order the sizzling sisig. Yes, it's pork head, but it's diced into little cubes that you can hardly tell what it is anymore. This dish is amazing... the fatty part just melts in your mouth and the leaner meat (if there is such thing in pork) is cooked to perfection.  As for the coconut rice, I prefer the Indonesian/Malay version that is less sweet, but the coconut rice here is pretty bomb too. Finally... drum roll please: the halo-halo! I have a weird affinity for halo-halo. If we ever meet in person, I'll tell you the story. It's shaved ice with condensed milk, coconut shavings and an unnaturally purple ice cream on top (that's ube flavored). Perfect way to end your meal. Service is great, friendly and unpretentious.

Go up the stairs, make a sharp left and push through the unmarked wooden door to the left of the bar. Welcome to Angel's Share.- Don't go with more than 4 people. No lie, they will NOT seat you.- Avoid the peak hours e.g. after 7:30PM, especially on Fridays and Saturdays. Waiting is no fun.They actually have two rooms. I've been here at least 5 times in the past year or so, but I've never been to the back room. The main room has about 6-8 seats along the bar, 2-3 booths, and 6-8 seats at the tables. I think I've tried most of their drinks and I can never remember their names lol, but they are each pieces of art -- definitely read each drink's descriptions for their stories/inspirations.Shingo Gokan is a true genius. After hearing how his Speak Low cocktail won the 2012 BACARDI Global Legacy Cocktail Competition and the selflessness of his competitors who helped him finish in time (look up the story!), I was super excited to finally try it for myself a few weeks ago. With Bacardi Superior, Bacardi Solera, Osborne Pedro Ximinez Sherry, Matcha and zest of yuzu, the drink was extremely subtle and masterfully crafted. I don't even like rum!

There was no foot traffic and Alphabet City was sketchy at best. Ten years later, the Keybar has proven me wrong, thank God! In the past ten years, Attila, Gyuszi and their fantastic staff have built a vibrant, neighborhood friendly venue that has created a sense of community. The last I've heard, there have been almost thirty couples who have met at the Keybar and have since been married (how many are still married is anyone's guess). I've also spent many an orphan holiday with the regulars at the bar. With a generous happy hour, live DJs and a good-looking and friendly staff, the Keybar is THE East Village destination. Some have deemed the small bar a ""dive"", but it's got more of a lounge feel. Many of the regulars have commented that the bar serves as the neighborhood living room, with a working fireplace, friendly staff and always a few regulars on hand. There is an awesome 2-for-1 Happy Hour Special that runs from 4pm - 10pm from Tuesday through Saturday and ALL DAY on Sundays and Mondays. The way the special works, buy your first round and they'll give you a ticket which you can redeem for a drink of the same or lesser value (any time any day). If you'd like to get a pricier drink, you can pay the difference on the card. I challenge you to find a more generous Happy Hour. In addition to the Happy Hour special, they have a birthday shot special, where you buy a round of shot for your party and they'll buy you another round! This special is good a week before/after your birthday and good anytime. As with all BOGO specials, I recommend tipping on the service not on when you pay, you're a grown-up act like one. I find Sunday through Tuesday are pretty low-key (no pun intended) and serve as great date nights. Wednesday and Thursday start to gear up as the weekend approaches and live DJs playing the hits. Friday is their big 80s, 90s rock night often featuring co-owner Gyuszi behind the decks. Saturday features co-owner Attila da Hun spinning Tech and Soulful House. If you come, you'll find a lot of regulars that are fiercely protective of the bar, but if you're cool, we'll welcome you with open arms. Stop by and you'll usually find me tapping my toe by the DJ booth or chatting with the beautiful staff. Say hi. I don't bite. Hard. :p",15,0.9988

So good that I forgot that I didn't ask for cheese until I was over half done. Now I wonder if cheese would have made it any better or not. Juicy, beefy, flavor packed perfection. Don't you dare ask for it well done, philistine! The shoestring fries were nondescript and probably out of a bag. But I didn't come for the fries. The service was excellent. The server was attentive and friendly and my burger was served quickly. Since I don't like beer (gasp!), I ordered an Original Sin hard cider. It starts off strangely since it's fermented with champagne yeast. But about half way thru... not so bad. If they carried Woodpecker, I think I'd commute to Corner Bistro every day.

Not the best but for $4, it seemed SOOO worth it!!Staff or the young Chinese guy behind the counter speaks fluent English and the place is very very casual and I saw a lot of kids coming in here for a quick snack or just to hang out.

First time I was there:- Dark horse oatmeal stout- Allagash Fluxus- cool puerto rican dude working behind the bar offering all sorts of beer suggestions, and friendly conversation.- good 80's music playing on the HI-FISecond time I was there:- black IPA which I was told is ""malt forward""- victory nate IPA- cool tattooed dude behind the bar offering suggestions, and great banterBoth times this place was a real win. What does malt forward mean? Well I'd be glad to explain, thx for asking!.Most beers have a 3% abv (alcohol by volume). Turns out this amount is too low to bottle & *AGE* beer like we do with wine, sake & liquors. However, those studious trappist fellows figured out that if you raise the alcohol level to 8% or more you can keep the beers for a long time. Beers in this range have that so-called malt flavor aka malt forward flavor because you taste the malt first. So some IPAs and many of the triples the Duvels and Delirium Tremens of beers will have that malt taste as well.Now we both know.You going on a date, take him or her here.

I wanna name restaurants after movies I like, Ronin, Rocky, Slaughterhouse-Five..So for French Restaurant Week, I selected Amélie for dinner. I must have walked past this place 1000 times. Here's the best part, for happy hour they have a wine flight that, I don't know how they make money. For $10 you can have a 3 glass tasting of ANY wine on their wine list, except full bottled wines. Holy Moley, I chose wine from Oregon, Italy and France. All for $10 bucks? And they were generous pours? Singing the Jackson 5: Sit down girl, I think I love you!Their price fixe dinner was pretty incredible. I started with burgundy escargots gratinée in garlic parsley butter. A great starter but my breath? I could have burnt down the village, its was pretty fierce. If you're on a date, stay clear of this dish. Unless you can tell she's a life soul sucking stooge. Then, order two dishes. The escargots are shelled and put into a special dimpled dish with a bread crumb topping.For the main entree, Roasted duck leg confit with sautéed wild mushrooms. Now how do the French take a duck and bring it to such high levels? The duck confit made at Amélie is very rustic and flavorful. I'll even go so far to say incredible.The Creme Brûlée with Banana was good, but I was reeling over the duck with crispy skin. The next time I come here, I know what I'm gonna order:Frisée salad with warm bacon shallot vinaigrette topped with brioche croutons and a poached eggWhole Brook Trout pan-roasted with sautéed haricots verts and sauce GrenobloiseListen, I don't know what Grenobloise is, but it sounds wicked good!I love Amélie!",9,0.9899

I really dig the vibe. There are a few places to sit around the bar and near the entrance and there are also tables in the back for larger groups. I like the decor too, it was trendy, chill, and well done. The music wasn't too loud and the layout of the bar is very accommodating. The staff was nice, and the wine recommendations were good. The location was also clutch for me, it is really close to all the trains in Union Square- which is a good central meeting place for a lot of my friends. I will definitely come back.",8,0.9828
1168,15,12,5.0,"The girls and I met up for a little catching up. I always find that a sign of a ""good time"" is when you meet up with your girls, set a time limit to leave, and always go over that time limit....by almost 4 hours to be exact. That's exactly what happened. The food was no short of spectacular and the service was impeccable. Hakan, one of the owners was so very sweet, attentive, and really made our dinner an experience. When we asked why was the place called the Quarter, it's because there are 4 partners, and each one owns a quarter of the restaurant. The ambiance is warm, cozy, and delightful. I personally love the mannequin in the bathroom, that if you aren't very careful and had one too many glasses of wine, you can mistake for another person (not that it happened to me, I'm just sayin'). We decided that the menu had so much food that we wanted to devour, that we each would get a dish and just share it three ways. GENIUS! (totally my idea) We ordered the cowboy ribeye which came with duck fat fried potatoes (OMG OMG) and a side of creamy béarnaise sauce (I really wanted to pour it all over my body, that's how good it was, but that totally would have been INAPPROPRIATE); we also had the hanger steak; and my dish to share was the short ribs (nothing short of amazing) with mashed potatoes. I hope my friends don't read this review; I was suppose to cut my short rib into even thirds for sharing, but I may or may not have done so, so as to ensure I had the larger piece. Shameful, I know. However, we then partnered our food with The Quarter's amazing wine selection.....and let us not forget dessert! Bread pudding, banana spring rolls with a cilantro sauce, and a peanut butter and chocolate dessert (whose name I forget, but I can still remember it's deliciousness on my palate). To end, this was such a great catch up session with my girls, and The Quarter added so much more to the experience.",15,0.9906
1169,16,34,5.0,"The first thing my Chinese dad said when we walked in: ""We're never coming back here again"".OK, just because a Chinese restaurant has a bunch of white people in it, it doesn't mean it's bad.Once he calmed down and we got seated, and he actually tasted the food, I could tell my dad could appreciate that the food was actually really really good, even though he still didn't want to admit it. He just complained about how there too many tourists, and how they weren't coming around with carts, like he is used to with most traditional Dim Sum places.Complaints from a grouchy old Chinese man aside though, this place has some really good Dim Sum. We were in a big group, so I got to try to several dishes. The standouts for me were the House Special Roast Pork Bun (huge and delicious for only $1.50, which is not bad for a good pork bun this size in the city) and the Sticky Rice with Chinese Sausage. And of course, you have to end with the delicious, fresh and hot Fried Sesame Balls with Lotus Paste. These were excellent here as well.Though it may not be like your traditional Dim Sum house, I would definitely recommend coming here...as long as you are with some people that can appreciate something a little different. And as long if you get here early if you come on the weekends, because it gets packed.",31,0.99

The food is inexpensive and the portions are more than enough for one person per plate. On Fridays they have a live musician/band singing Spanish ballads from 10pm to 1am. He's an amazing singer and worth seeing, that's definitely a night to check out Guadalupe. The wait time can get a little crazy here and they do not take reservations (on a weekend you can wait an hour to be seated). I suggest the churrasco and if you're not driving a Guadalupe margarita (their signature drink).  Parking is tricky in the area, I some times resort to using the under ground lot on Sherman ave and 207th st. *Take it easy on those Guadalupe margarita's!!!

1174,12,15,5.0,"Avenue is one of my favorite places in New York to go out to. It is nicely styled with chandeliers and 'vintage' art works on the walls, beautiful lighting and good ambiance. Expect to listen to house, hip-hop and Top 40. I have many good memories of nights at Avenue. The crowd is mostly in their 20's. Good looking people, models and celebrities appear to like Avenue as well. Good boy/girl ratio. Not having a table is kind of difficult here when you are with a group. The place is set up with tables left and right, and a relatively narrow 'avenue' (get it?!) in the middle that leads to a small bar area. You can sort of dance at your table, in the lane and near the bar, but: This is not a 'disco'. Don't expect an actual dance floor. You won't find it. You can also go upstairs. They play different music there. Avenue is posh, swanky and might be hard to get in at times, depending on which day and more importantly what time you go. I mean... Yes... SERIOUSLY:.... What are some of these reviewers thinking when they show up at 12.30 without any table reservations or connections on a weekend night with a bunch of friends, and refusing to get a table? Don't show up so late please if you don't know anybody there. Be there an hour earlier. It helps. A lot. Let me explain one thing here, because some people here need a reality check. PLEASE stop whining about people at the door being rude or say that they are ....holes. Welcome to the top 10 of New York's hottest clubs. Do you think that I have never had to deal with any of this? The guys being the way they are at the door is something that happens pretty much when you go to ANY of Manhattan's top 10 most popular clubs. Go to a B-list club if your ego can't handle it. I'm not condoning rudeness here. However please realize and accept that this is at times the reality you have to deal with when you try to get into the most popular clubs in Manhattan. Even somebody as sweet/special/smart/rich/beautiful/well dressed/important as you might have a hard time sometimes. Yup. Avenue's doorman Wass Stevens gave the following advice in W Magazine:""Be yourself, be honest, be nice. Don't try to be something you're not, but try to be a better version of yourself. And know walking up that your chances are slim at best. That way, if you make it past the rope, it's a pleasant surprise. If you don't, you just regroup and go on with your evening."" My tips: Keep groups small, ( up to 4 people) unless if you plan to get a table anyway. Have more girls than guys or at the least an equal amount if possible. Arrive early. Avoid screaming things like ""Do you know who I am???"".",25,0.9975

If you can't afford dinner here yet, lunch is definitely a great alternative to experience what the differences are in michelin star rated restaurants. 2 course prix fixe menu $38. This will definitely fill you up for a lunch. Trust me.++ Amuse Bouche- 3 tastes of summer: fried sushi topped with salmon belly, fried okra in black sesame sauce, and salmon puree soup. These were delicious and flavorful, each in their owns ways. Great start to a great meal. 1. Hamachi Sashimi- topped with avocado sauce and radish. Eat them all together in one and voila, it was heavenly pieces, melting in your mouth.2. Wagyu Beef- medium rare in butter sauce with butternut squash. The beef was well prepared and a very reasonable size. This was an additional $10ish I believe. 3. Late Harvest Season- I wasn't too impressed with this dessert. It had peach compost with jelly, and marinated figs. I forgot what else it came with.. but the flavors were a bit too much for me.4. Macaroons, Chocolates, & homemade vanilla bean marshmallows- so many to choose from since they provided you complimentary goodies. 4 different types of chocolates included with everything else!I also got to try the sea bass and yellowtail tuna... these were AMAZING.. Jean-Georges is amazing with his sauces and ingredients. Even if it may just be a slice of fish, his whole entire dish makes up for it. He is full of flavor (but not too overpowering) and I love it.Venue screams out classy and sophisticated. I love the brightness to the formal dining room with its high windows and ceilings.

Yay.Now, *drumroll* the food - I ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen, which is what I order at every ramen place I go to if they have it, as I prefer rich broth over clear broth. Delicious! Noodles: Their noodles were interesting, as they were a little flat, but firm like the round ones you normally see. I'm not sure what these noodles are called, but its the stiffer ones versus the curly instant ramen noodle kind. Perfect consistency and firmness.Broth: A little too thick/rich in my opinion, as I feel that the richness of broth at Totto (though made of chicken) is more of the type I like. Great taste and flavor however, with the right amount of spicy that doesn't make your food unenjoyable.Egg: PERFECT.

I was a 90s kid, so obviously I grew up with the sounds of Tribe Called Quest, 2Pac, and the glory days of hip hop. Those two different genres of music led me on a beautiful spiritual journey to discovering jazz. Ever since I was a teenager, the sounds of Monk, Coltrane, and Davis have enlightened, haunted, and enriched my life.The Jazz at Lincoln Center is an establishment that is not only keeping jazz alive, but they are working hard to making it accessible to everyone. Dizzy's Club is a wonderful part of that admirable and important pursuit. Tuesdays-Saturdays, the club has a special late night session. The musicians that played in the more expensive evening session play from 11:00-12:30 for the public in a special session called ""Late Nights at Dizzys.""

Every dish was the best I've every had. It was the best lobster, the best beef, the best fish... you name it. Dessert was cray cray.This is a lifetime experience. The staff said yes to every request. I joked and asked if I could have a baby elephant. The maitre d said they didn't have any. I'm scared to think if they did. How would I take the baby elephant with me back on the subway?

1185,9,5,5.0,"Shorty's is very close to my office and despite it having been open a yr (I think?), I still had yet to stop in. I told Mike about this ""cheesesteak and craft beer bar,"" and he declared it ""relevant to his interests"" and the chosen venue for our double date which we scheduled for this past Saturday. Cheesesteaks are yet another guilty pleasure of mine--no, forget it, I think they're awesome!It's a nicely designed space, almost like a gastropub, but with a menu completely inspired by Philly: cheesesteaks galore, Yuengling-battered onion rings, assorted hoagies and even hoagie salads. We split appetizers and ordered cheesesteaks. Everything was delicious. I stuck to a classic cheesesteak with Whiz and fried onions plus lettuce and tomato in a feeble attempt to add some nutritional value to it. I was impressed with the rolls which are apparently brought it in daily from the City of Brotherly Love, and the quality of the meat which can often be stringy. I will say that the sandwiches are huge and can really be split by two people if you aren't famished. As for the drinks, I was delighted as always to see Southampton Publick House brews on the menu. For what is essentially a beer bar, Shorty's offers an extensive cocktail menu as well. The bartender has a good pitching arm.The service was friendly and attentive, and didn't mind that we stayed for a while in our booth, deep in conversation. I've spent a decent amount of time in Philly over the yrs and feel that Shorty's is not only a fitting tribute to a cool city but is also a great bar with a fun concept.",12,0.9952
1186,8,5,5.0,"Benjamin Steakhouse is an incredible experience. The high ceiling, the detailing in the architecture, and the dim lighting all add to the ambiance of the room. We sat downstairs near the fireplace, where Ricky took care of us. I knew going in to order bacon slices, and I have a love for crab cakes so those were immediately ordered as well. They came out quickly, and were delicious. One of the gentleman at the table wasn't crazy for the bacon, one of his pieces was slightly gristly. The crab cakes were 95% crab, no cheap filler or breading. We ordered steak for 3 Medium Rare (despite having 4 at the table), creamed spinach, mushrooms, and a baked potato.Once the entree arrived the dining experience became extraordinary. Ricky served everyone a few slices of the porterhouse. He demonstrated that the steak was so incredibly tender by their dry aging process, that he could cut through the thick steak slice with nothing but a spoon. As we ate, Ricky kept adding additional slices of the porterhouse to our plates. Although he had at least 3 other tables, I felt as though he was always available when needed. The stand out side was the creamed spinach, I definitely recommend it.In comparison to a other well established steakhouses in the area, I give Benjamin the highest regard. They provide the taste and flavors of Peter Lugers, but blow them out of the water when it comes to service and atmosphere. The steak is beyond amazing, and I highly recommend Benjamin Steakhouse to anyone!",14,0.9721
1187,7,10,5.0,"...Progressive Thai Comfort Food... Let that process in your brain for a hot minute because that is EXACTLY what you'll get here at Ember Room. You'll find that over the course of your meal that these four little words (found on their website) pretty much sum up what this place is all about. What drew me to Ember Room is the slick, and glowing red modern decor. I have a short attention span (like a gold fish or a puppy) so naturally, I am attracted to cool, shiny bright stuff (like cats and children are). I am such a sucker for cool stuff, and Ember Room fits my usual. The staff is so friendly here, everyone is smiley and so helpful. As we got the menu, the first thing I notice is the chef's unique and memorable name, Chef Ian Chalermkittichai. The next thing I noticed was the drink menu. Thank goodness because a good cocktail was needed. Each of us tried a different drink and it was hard to pick a favorite. I had ""One thousand and one nights"" which is a creation with ingredients gin, fresh blueberrys, and strawberry liquor. Our server made really great suggestions for drinks and for food and was not pushy at all. Next on the agenda was to get some chow because we were all starving!! For apps, we shared Thai Pastrami Meatballs served on a hotplate, Green Curry Lasagna, and Thai Tacos. All had really interesting presentation, and equally good taste. We also ordered a volcano chicken (which they bring on on fire) which has a really amazing crispy texture and a Korean BBQ friend rice. This was a good blend of Asia fusion, modern risks with a splash of ""comfort"" food. I haven't been so pleasantly surprised in a while, especially since I just found this place by chance.",10,0.9961
1188,14,11,5.0,"Hearth: a word whose Teutonic origins cause both those who speak it and those who hear it to conjure visions of stoked fires and sweeping, wooden eaves. It is no wonder then that in this house that comfort built, chef Marco Canora focuses on rustic simplicity and pronounced seasonality in his menu. I tend to find that heavily seasonal restaurants peak in autumn, given the timing of various harvests and crop cycles combined with our instinctual nature to seek out richer, heartier sources of sustenance. Given the opportunity that M's birthday presented, taking her to Hearth was an easy choice to make.Nestled into an unassuming corner of East 12th street, with only a swath of brick gilded by a back-lit steel sign to mark its entrance, Hearth exudes a certain confident charm. Upon catching glimpses of merry diners through the expanse of windows, you will see that Hearth's confidence is not foolhardiness. On entering, the swath of brick from the exterior morphs into a tableau that envelops the restaurant and the adjacent bar. Copper pots hang dramatically on the wall, gleaming under what feel like individual stage lights. But that is where the drama ends, for this is a place of comfort. The lights are dim, the seating is plush, and the tones are hushed. Though they were few in number, the large groups that were present were mercifully quiet, not boisterous. This is a restaurant for a tête-à-tête, not a girls' night out before making the dubious stumble into the Lower East Side. After M arrived, the maître d' seated us along the aforementioned wall of brick, leaving us with our thoughts and our devilishly enticing wine menus. The connection Hearth holds with Terroir becomes immediately apparent at their first perusal. If a country produces wine, it will likely have a place on the menu. Having planned not to drink that night, the well-curated list proved a formidable test of my conviction. Though I ultimately won out, I would surely ask for a pairing on my next visit.When our waiter, his madras shirt alone further evidence of the unpretentious, cozy nature of the restaurant, came with our menus for the evening, we were presented with equally difficult choices. The entire bounty of fall seemed to be represented on it. We decided to start with a salad of warm autumn vegetables, and a plate of a sort of ricotta terrine with fall greens. The vegetables were absurdly fresh and shone through their light dressing, enhanced by their warmth. The ricotta was fluffy, creamy, mild and sweet. In short, everything a good ricotta should be. For our main courses, I chose the braised rabbit, while M chose the poached cobia. Her cobia arrived, steaming from the kitchen, with matsutake mushrooms, farro, and brussel sprout segments strewn beneath it. As a finishing touch, mushroom consommé was poured over the proceedings. The expected and realized traits of the consommé could describe the dish itself; earthy, light, and subtle. The farro and brussel sprouts were necessary pillars of firm texture, holding the other elements together. My braised rabbit was cooked wonderfully, and the bones intact presentation seemed to heighten the pastoral flavor profile of rosemary, olives and sofrito. The accompanying polenta, while a bit heavy on the rosemary, was equally agrarian, though it was served in lovely copper pots. In retrospect, I rue not partaking in the tasting menu. Seventy-six dollars for several courses of this caliber is a steal. But I digress. Being a birthday dinner, in spite of our mutual lamentation at the thought of consuming still more food, we ordered dessert. My apple cider donuts were like none other I've had, in the best way possible. Flaky, yet dense and cakey, paired with the lightest of whipped cream, they were heavenly. When M's pear tarte tatin came bearing a birthday message ascribed in chocolate, I was grateful at the demureness with which it was handled. No awkward requests, no secret parlance. Just a restaurant performing a kind gesture. That the tarte itself was a luxuriously sweet vehicle for the ever so slight acidity of the pear was merely an exclamation point.Hearth, like many restaurants in New York, does not receive the attention it merits. It, and the homeyness it evokes, are taken for granted in the constant desire to seek the new, the bold. Let the bold and the new clamber over one another for the titles bequeathed by the scene-seekers. Yet and still, Mr. Canora's creation, now approaching its tenth year, lives, and we are all the luckier for it.",20,0.9971
1189,9,3,5.0,"Simply amazing. Imagine all the best aspects of Angel's Share, Apotheke, and Milk & Honey, all combined into one place. As an added bonus, enjoy the amenities without having to trek to the sketchy parts of Chinatown, without all your friends getting lost in the Japanese restaurant hiding the bar entrance, and without huge crowds hogging the limited seating.Rogue & Canon is situated exactly on the border of SoHo and West Village (after all, the entrance is on ""Ho"" street).  I let the staff pick my first drink and lo and behold, the Russian Firing Squad came in a copper beggar's cup mug (see photo), just like the Stormy Weather from Angel Share! Between the 8 of us, our table wound up sampling almost every cocktail and we universally voted the Navy Grog and Apple Pie among our favorites (brace yourself for the cinnamon ice cube).Another reason R&C wins 5 stars is their food selection. Unlike many speakeasy type bars with a tiny selection of overpriced peanut bowls and sliders, Rogue & Canon has a real dinner menu with its own unique selections. You can get the Canon Burger, standard, hearty angus (get it, like the canon in a song, not the war cannon); or the Rogue Burger, for the true rogues, which includes a thick, fatty slice of pork belly and a generous layer of peanut butter (yes, sweet and savory, melted peanut butter).  I also tried the fried shrimp (should be called popcorn shrimp), the panna cotta, and the deviled eggs, all delicious!At last, SoHo has a much needed hardcore mixology offering!",14,0.9831

If you don't have a reservation, expect to wait - and not even at the bar. Outside. A friend and I stopped by, rang the doorbell. An adorable, accented, bow-tied butler comes to the door and asks for our reservation. We, clueless, don't have one - so go down the street for a few minutes for a drink at BLT before returning for a second try.He lets us in, and the bar is standing room only. We pass by a few plush couches with tables, extremely sexy. It's all dates besides my friend and I, and I'm envious of their well-informed boyfriends who brought them.The cocktails are pricey, and delicious. I tried too many, but recommend the Bramble - gin and muddled blackberries, and the Self-starter. I'll be back as soon as I have a chance/need to impress someone.",14,0.9572

We had a company happy hour here with about 30 people total. Tribeca is not exactly a convenient location unless you already live or work in the area, but luckily our office is walking distance to the neighbourhood. The service was great - the wait staff was never far from our tables to make sure we had everything we need. And the happy hour food menu was great, from the bacon-wrapped dates, to the pulled pork sliders, to the tuna tartare tacos. Most of all, it just had a great ambience, and it's definitely a spot to take someone if you want a place that's intimate but also casual.",12,0.9935
1192,10,8,5.0,"Let me disagree with some of the reviewers below:You don't need to read Macbeth to appreciate this experience. In fact, it might help to come in with a totally blank slate and let your mind wander. That being said, most people naturally felt the need to follow a narrative so they kept joining the annoying and sheep-like packs who were probably being led by inside plants. It's funny how reluctant most people are to carve an individual experience (which this is supposed to be).Of course, I gave in as well and joined the big, engrossing scenes like the minotaur orgy rave sacrifice and the dinner finale, as well as several bar scenes. Those are definitely the highlights, but the various sets are all individually awesome--from the moonlit forest to the candy store to the taxidermy gallery. You won't see everything, which is reason to return at some point (if you can stomach the hefty admission fee again).It's a wonderful bit of modern participatory theater that everyone (except folks with serious health problems and those mortified of the dark) should check out.",17,0.7391
1193,36,8,5.0,"I've been working on this review for 6 months. My then boyfriend, now fiance, had made reservations here for our six month anniversary. Words can't do the experience justice. THE best dining experience I have had, and it was everything (and more) I had expected from a 3 Michelin Star/#24 (now #10) restaurant in the world. All 5 senses are engaged during the meal.We did the 16 course tasting menu - every. single. dish. was. to. die. for. We asked for a tour of the kitchen as well which was a wonderful experience. I was really surprised how clean it was despite how busy they were.Our initial server was okay, but he was shortly replaced by a much friendlier and personable server. I wish I could remember his name because he added that extra flair to the dining experience.The end of the meal is of course always going to be the most memorable and best part of the night. My fiance had planned to do a table-side proposal, however, I foiled his plan. We were talking about proposals, and I told him I considered restaurants to be too public of a place for my liking. Last minute, he had the staff move patrons from the small, private lounge area. After our last course, we were guided to the private lounge where they had two champagne glasses placed on a table & my favorite song playing on a small speaker in the background (as requested by my fiance). The whole staff cheered as they popped a bottle of champagne bottle. They asked us to wait so they could get the glasses ready for us after we were done. They actually packed the (Vera Wang) glasses in a nice box AND boxed the cork in a small, cute box with an EMP ribbon - so sweet & sentimental.It really is the best dining experience, and if I could give them extra stars for their thoughtfulness, I would.

They have Street Fighter II, Paperboy, Fight Champ, Frogger, Ms. Pac Man, the original Marvel vs. Capcom and pinball machines (with BEER HOLDERS!!!)To think my boyfriend and I actually found this place my complete mistake. I was surprising him with tickets to a touring film festival but we were looking for a place to enjoy drinks and I was going to take him to Max Fish because he likes arcade games and such. I ended up taking a wrong turn onto Essex street and we both stopped in our tracks immediately upon seeing the arcade machines and bar set-up and hopped in.He was excited with the games they have, the ""nostalgic bad"" arcade pizza (their pie sits under a heat lamp in a big, old-school box thing) and ""nostalgic"" hot dogs on one of these spinning griller things (think 7-11, only they had no hot dogs on it this night, lol) and he enjoyed some red wine.I was excited for the games and for the cool selection of (seemingly curated and probably constantly rotating) domestic craft beers (Coney Island Lager much! YAY!) and seasonal foreign brews as well.Had a nice chat with the manager too about wines and their friendly bartender told us that they had just opened about 5-6 weeks ago.

It is so delicious and there are always different flavors to try.

The server must have noticed how terrible I looked, because he brought over some onigiris for Chinh T. and me, on the house, which he thought would help me feel better as I ate my mushroom salad. He asked if I were feeling sick, and when I admitted I wasn't feeling well, he asked if I wanted to drink some broth instead. I nodded in agreement, expecting just some warm soup, but he brought over an entire soba for me to eat and also said it was on him. I honestly would not even expect a boyfriend to be so attentive and thoughtful.

1197,11,20,5.0,"W,I still remember when I first met you. It was late spring, over a year ago, I had just moved onto your block. People were eating brunch outside on your front porch and I bumped into you in my gym shorts listening to my iPod. One of your friends made fun of your ungainliness. I thought you looked cute under your blue V-shaped umbrellas. We started passing by each other on the street. You'd tip your glass at me, I'd wave back through my dry cleaning. You were always busy, really popular--all the girls flocked to you. Once, I mentioned a crafts project I was working on - a corkboard. You laughed at me and I felt silly. Later I found myself with two grocery bags of corks you had saved up from all of your parties.We went on a first date. I was nervous, and we were both tipsy. You made lamb chops and lemon potatoes and we finished a few bottles of wine. It was a warm night so we sat at the tables in your back terrace watching the people come and go (talking of Michelangelo).You called. We flirted. I played hard to get. Accidental run-ins were planned and I'd casually stop by for a drink. I made sure never to stay too late and you'd always walk me home around the corner. You raved about your fine selection of wines-by-the-glass, Bourdeax blends, and Volkan, the owner of your building, who effectively built the place himself. You were intriguing. I lingered. We spent the night in your wine cellar. At the start of summer you asked me to go steady with you. I wasn't sure if I was ready to be with someone who was such a fervent proponent of free-range chicken and grass-fed beef, but you were as sweet as your red velvet cupcakes and as quirky as your bacon beer. I was quite beside myself.  Wine:30, don't ever change. Keep chopping the hot peppers and I'll stir the shrimp on the stove.Love, N",6,0.9437
1198,13,9,5.0,"No. 200 goes to Angel's Share!Angel's Share clearly does not need any more reviews, most people love it, including myself. So, I'll leave you with specific items.One - my only quibble - light pours:The cocktails are crafted very well, but the pours are light on the booze. Expectations of a stiffer, bigger pour might be a classic 'Murican idea, but for the prices charged, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a decent pour.This is my only beef, everything else was excellent.Two - groups of four or less:Since most reviews say this, if you -don't- know this, you deserve to be shown the door. It's like walking in to Milk & Honey (which you shouldn't be able to, but that's M&H's fault), and not knowing (or feigning ignorance) that they have a reservations policy. C'mon, now. If you're really into a nice cocktail, do your homework a little.Three - quick seating (yes, really):My friend and I got there at 8:30 pm on a holiday Friday, and were seated right away at a four-person booth by the window. I would like to think that my reputation for general awesomeness preceded me, and that my stunning handsomeness sealed the deal - but we all know that reality is opposite that.So -despite- my awkwardness, we were -still- seated right away.We were told that we may have to move to the bar or a two-person spot later. Fine by me, you can fold me into the coat rack for all I care, so long as I can drink.So much to love about this seating arrangement - a four-person spot can be taken by two people if you just move the pair later, when a foursome needs the table. This way, the table is utilized, the pair is happy, and the foursome gets their table later. I can see this not working in a restaurant when seatings are for longer, but in a cocktail spot, it's a great tactic.Four - Daahoud:if you're a brown spirits drinker, get the Daahoud. The smoke-under-inverted-glass is not just a neat trick, it adds to the drink, and makes it unique. At first I was mildly annoyed that the bouquet of the spirit was replaced by the smoke, but once I got used to it, I felt like the smoke added to the cocktail. (see photo)Five - No Douchebags:This was surprising, considering my tendency towards being highly judgmental (in my head, of course - ""eww, look at the dress on her"", ""wtf, take off your baseball cap, jackass""). Don't hate, you know you do it too. Everyone I saw was there to enjoy a nice cocktail, and not be showy or obnoxious. You know what they say - if you don't see any [fill in the blank] in a room, you're the guy. I hope that wasn't the case! Anyway, it was a nice crowd. It helps a LOT that they have a no-standing policy - more cocktail spots should do this. Employees Only allows standing, and so was packed to the gills when I went. Also had a really annoying crowd. Don't know if there's a connection there, but I bet there is ...Six - it's Japanese:When people say that it's a ""Japanese speakeasy"", don't be put off by ingredients like Japanese whiskey, sake, and yuzu. Some reviewers say ""Sake, ick"". Are you an idiot? The Japanese restaurant next door isn't an affectation!Sorry, I know this is long, but I have one more thing to add ... Seven - SPOILER ALERT - exactly where it is:Speakeasy-type spots are fun, but are no longer secrets. NYC will always have it secrets, and places that are meant to be secret will remain so. Angel's Share has 900+ reviews, so clearly the cat's out of the bag.When you enter Village Yokocho from the street, take the stairs up. Stairs bend around to the left. As soon as you reach the restaurant, Angel's Share is the unmarked door to your left. The door opens to the back wall of the bar - this makes sense, as the bar windows front the second floor of the building. I've seen a bunch of people talk about walking ""all the way through / to the back of"" the restaurant. Wrong. It might be funny to confuse the noobs, but that's annoying to the people trying to eat, and to the staff when they get asked -yet again- where Angel's Share is.So, open the unmarked door, walk in, and a friendly waiter will help you out.",14,0.9981

1200,5,9,5.0,"100TH REVIEW, BABY!I hemmed and hawed over what to review for my 100th, until I recalled my recent haircut and color at Laura Braunstein. Problem solved. All the more appropriate because Laura is celebrating its 6 month anniversary of opening. If you check out my rating distribution, you will see that I give very few five stars. Laura deserves it, and more! I've gotten a 3/4 color, cut and gloss deal at LB with two different stylists. Sadly, I forget their names. But honestly, I feel like everyone there is excellent. Most recently, I booked an appointment the same day (when does that EVER work out?) but a couple hours later the receptionist called and very apologetically asked if I could possibly come in earlier, because one of the stylists had gone home sick. I couldn't, and my voice betrayed how sad I was, because lord knows my roots were showing and I had no other free time last week. I hung up, dejected. Just a half hour later the receptionist called back, saying that she had rearranged some other appointments and I could come in at my normal appointment time after all. I was amazed - where in New York do receptionists EVER go out of their way like that?Even better was the actual haircut and color. Both times my blonde highlights have come out beautifully, brightening my whole face. The women just seem excellently trained. And did I mention that you get free wine or a cocktail with your cut?Finally, I HIGHLY recommend getting the gloss. I am blessed/cursed with thick and ""thick-shafted"" hair, which is basically always dry (the curse part). The gloss makes all of the difference, especially after having angered my hair with all of those color chemicals. I come away with silky, beautiful hair whose texture seems improved even after several washes. And the hair stylists are amazing with the blow dryer. Even though it explicitly says in the procedure description that a blow dry isn't included, both times they've styled my hair so that I walk out ready to hit the town.OK at this point I'm rambling, but just a few final, positive notes. They don't push product. Win! The prices are quite reasonable. Double win! They give you both the beginning and end time of the procedure - my hair color, cut and gloss went from 5pm to 7pm sharp. I was walking out the door at 6:55pm. None of this three or four hours bullshit. Can you tell I love Laura? Why can't all salons be this wonderful? Happy 6 months, LB!",13,0.9952

(But seriously, pay close attention to the street address or you'll wind up in either (a) the sushi place next door, or (b) nowhere/an office building)After almost coming here with a fellow Yelp-Elite, I found myself with another hungry foodie also ready to partake in the tasty small plates offered at Sakagura! We split six selections between two of us:Ika Shiokara - A small plate of sliced raw squid in a salty squid liver marinade. Although small, this is still good to split, as I would have probably found it too overwhelming in both salt and bitterness to down the entire thing myself.Hiyayakko - My friend chose this and ate most of it, but I managed to have a couple of bites. She really liked it, but I was indifferent (I'm not a big tofu fan to begin with so don't listen to me!) I did enjoy the crunch from the grated ginger and scallion flakes though.Sake Oyako Don - This was a bit larger than the first two, and one of my favorites. Fresh strips of salmon and salmon roe (eggs) with soy sauce was served over a half-sphere of sushi rice. The salmon was delicious and soft, and had nice stripes/marbling of the fat layers. The miso soup that comes with this was unnecessary, but definitely welcomed. Buta Kakuni - We ordered two of these, and, as others have described, this stewed pork is melt-in-your-mouth delicious! Along with the salmon, this was also a standout dish. I highly recommend getting this, especially since it's small enough to ""squeeze in"" with other choices.Kama Roast - Slices of chilled duck wrapped scallion with basil sauce. This was good, but not as good as the others. It's also $10, but a decent portion for the price. Onsen Tamago - Sea urchin and soft boiled egg in cold soup - This was delicious, but definitely an acquired taste (sea urchin is very soft). Even though this is a soup, it's still very ""splittable"" - chunks are small enough without doing too much cutting/piercing.With their exhaustive menu, I'll definitely be coming back again, but I'm thrilled we managed to conquer some great land and sea-based offerings on the menu.

I was extremely impressed by my experience at Wall Street Dental.Although initially disappointed--yet not at all surprised--by the fact that everything done during my horrible experience last year had to be redone, I was incredibly relieved and comforted by the high level of professionalism, thoroughness, courtesy, friendliness, warmth, and understanding by the Receptionist, the Dental Assistant, and the actual Dentist. ""Now that's what I call service,"" is the first cliche that comes to mind, but I mean it sincerely. ""I wish I could go to the dentist more often,"" is something I never imagined myself thinking, but my experience here was so positive, it's true.When I came back raving about how happy I was with my experience here, my roommate said he couldn't wait to go too! It's rare to be this excited by the dentist, but even after a few weeks of reflection and reconsideration, the feeling remains strong.You should go to Wall Street Dental... and please tell them David Lopez sent you!",8,0.9894

I still don't know what happened but I hope I can show my face in public today without getting arrested.A decor that looks a fairly land scene from True Blood. Everything is pastel colored, sparkling lights, large over sized chairs, and candle lit. It is almost like entering a speakeasy with it's narrow stairway to the second floor and being greeted by a statue of the Blessed Mother. Huh? Ok - bless the hangover I will end up with after this!Service is super on-point and our waitress was chipper and friendly, while offering terrific suggestions. I liked that the girls working the floor all had retro outfits on like back in 1960's Cuba, and some with tattoos. Very cool look. The place was hopping and everyone was in a cheerful mood. It's like a party on Friday night.What can I say other then get a punch bowl. You have to. It's a must. It's all about the rum. A lot of rum. We had the ""Intro To Awesome"" punch bowl. Damn, that was good, and a lot for two. Served in a silver chalice bowl with mismatched tea cups I made sure not one drop was left.At this point we were ravenous. Everything here is served tapas style which was perfect for us to share. The plantain chips came with delicious guacamole and black bean dip. The combo slider plate had a braised beef slider, a Cuban style sandwich, and a fritta Cuban style slider. Again, so freaking good. We had to end this with their house made churros which were pretty amazing! Served in a large cup there is a lot of crispy, airy, warm, and sugary churros to eat along with dulce de leche and a bitter chocolate sauce to dip in. Finger licking good!A classy touch is getting the bill served in a cigar box. Oh yeah, before we left I had to get their house Zombie drink served in a glass skull mug. They even hand you a card listing the ingredients and warn that only one is allowed per customer. I laughed in defiance. Heck, we had pre-gamed at Death & Company before coming here. I don't remember too much after that. I really hope no one took video or snapped pictures.Also, I vaguely remember the waitress giving us a few complimentary shots that had brandied cherries in them. I do remember feeling like drunk Gumby and almost falling down the stairs. I hope I'm allowed back here again!",35,0.999
1206,12,17,5.0,"LISTEN. By all accounts, Hurricane Sandy, hours away from landfall, has the potential to be a whopper of a storm. While I feel very safe in my cozy and highly-elevated part of upper Manhattan, who is to say what will happen, right? Flooding. High winds. Debris everywhere. This storm COULD be The End of Days. But! If Sandy is going to kill me, at least I can go down happy...with about five pounds of artisan cheese in my belly.Tucked away on Bleecker, just down the street from it's mother cheese shop, Murray's Cheese Bar boasts lots of cozy seating and, indeed, an actual bar. The tables were rustic, nicely decorated with white and red napkins that made me feel I was at a farm table, albeit a very fancy one, surrounded by hipsters and European teens. Friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff were quick on their toes, made very helpful suggestions about menu items, and had half-empty water glasses re-filled lickity split.The menu consists of two sides: salads, sandwiches, and main dishes on one, with cheese and meats on the other. Cheeses are broken down into various categories: Fresh, Soft Ripened, Washed Rind, Semi-Firm & Firm, and Blue. Each cheese is described by its origin, whether it's pasteurized or not, what animal the milk originates from, and its key defining notes (e.g.: fruity, creamy, funky, briny). Adam and I split a cheese flight of three cheeses; they are picked by the cheesemonger and they will accommodate requests. However, we just said, ""GO FOR IT."" We wanted to be surprised by whatever came out. About five minutes later, the cheesemonger came directly to our table with the cheeses, their accompanying sides, and a small and adorable white fabric bag filled with breads and crackers. Our first cheese was Murray's Cavemaster Reserve ""Hudson Flower"", a pasteurized sheep's milk cheese, crusted in herbs and served with a side of earl gray tea-soaked edible flowers. Out second cheese was the Twig Farm Soft Wheel, a raw goat and cow's milk cheese, served with a slightly spicy pickle relish. Damned if I can remember the name of the third cheese we got, and too bad because it was my favorite. It was parmasean-esque and served with a soaked and sweet fig.For meals, I ordered the Classic Melt, a grilled cheese served with a small bowl of smoky tomato soup. One, the amount of cheese in the sandwich was overwhelming, and I say that in the most complimentary way! I'm not sure of the exact blend of cheeses used, but let me say this: I WAS ABLE TO SCRAP IT OUT OF MY SANDWICH WITH A SPOON. It was melty, almost lava-like, just dripping out of my sandwich upon each bite. This would be an item used in the finest food porn movie, surely. Its bread was how a grilled cheese sandwich's bread SHOULD be: thick, white and buttery with a golden crunchy crust. The soup was the absolutely perfect accompaniment to it; with the unholy amounts of cheese I had just consumed, I'm glad the bowl was relatively small. It was fresh and tasty and cut down the strongness of the cheese when necessary.Adam ordered the Rarebit Cheddar Burger. As we arrived at Murray's, the lovely couple to the right of me were chomping on burgers, and before long, Adam was fixated in a stare towards their table. We laughed and he apologized, but he was wondering what they had ordered. The woman had the special blue cheese burger, while he gentleman ordered the rarebit burger. He highly recommended it. Adam bought it. Adam was more than pleased. By the time he got his burger, not only did the new table to the right of us inquire as to what Adam was eating, but the table to the left did too! (I'd like to think the the original gentleman started an unknowing trend in what to order at Murray's that night.) As for the burger, it was perfectly plump, the cheese sauce was was decadent, and it was cooked perfectly with a delicious amount of grill char on the outside.For drinks, we went the cider route. I was surprised by the Sarasola Cider, a Basque cider with a fermented Kombucha-like flavor. The color was muted and it was pretty flat. Not my cup of tea, per se, but despite that, it was actually pleasant. It counted the rest of my gastronomical experience well. Adam got the Foggy Ridge Sweet Stayman Cider, which was much sweeter, more apple-y, and fizzier. We are already planning trips back, assuming we survive Sandy's wrath. If not, consider this to be my final and grand manifesto.",16,0.9982
1207,14,8,5.0,"Bring home the bacon!!!!!!!No really, you'll want to. This is by far the number one reason why I am giving these guys an extra star. This was THE BEST bacon I have ever tasted in all of my years of dining out in NY. You should not come here without ordering a side if you are a bacon lover. The title doesn't lie you may want to order an extra side so you can bring home the bacon. I had the pleasure of having the kale with eggs. A bit on the pricey side if you consider I didn't have cheese and the cost of two eggs and kale. I felt like they could have put more kale on the plate. It just didn't seem that substantial... but it was delicious!! My friend had the grits with some kind of muffin with gravy and their scrambled slow cooked eggs. All of which I tried and all of which were delicious.

But aside from all of that, the drinks are pretty spectacular. I'm always amazed at the long columnar looking ice ""columns"" (not cubes, duh).  Was able to get a table last Thursday night; the crowd was pretty chill. Some locals, and some not so local who have heard of this place...even though it's called Please Don't Tell. It seems as if everyone has been telling...I meaaaaannnn. We waited about an hour for an opening; but it wasn't so bad since we managed to wait while devouring a crif dog and some pretty damn good cheese tator tots. I digress... So an hour later, and 2 blocks away, we got a call that our table was available. We finished our drinks at another bar that remains nameless (not memorable), and b-lined our way back.

While we waited for our table, we stayed by the bar and were given shot after shot on the house! They also have various flavors of sangria. You cannot go wrong with the mango one, trust me on this.Once we were seated, the staff was nothing but friendly from start to finish. It also helps that the waiters are eye candy. I had the sea bass, and while I could not finish it, it was very very tasty. The steak looked excellent, as well. The appetizers are super yummy. The plaintains are amazing, as are the crabs. Overall, everything we had was delicious. You WILL be dancing throughout your entire meal. The music is catchy and a mix of yesterday and today. You can also tell the DJ it's your birthday and they do something special, as well. Definitely a great place to get a meal and some drinks.

While said French bakeries are a joy to taste and behold, well, sometimes you'd just rather have an all-American neighborhood bakery that's much more accessible and affordable.Insert Amy's Bread. I have lived in HK for over 3 years now, and have to say that I've probably lived off this awesome little bakery. I am in no way exaggerating when I say that I sometimes find myself here up to 4 times a week, whether it's to pick up a loaf of fresh bread, a salad for lunch, or some sweet pastries and cookies for breakfast and dessert. I have probably tried just about everything they have to offer by now. So I guess it's time I bumped it up to 5 stars, if not only for its consistency and reliability. In the spirit of the July 2012 Challenge though, I shall focus on the sweets served at Amy's; i.e. I will now rattle off a bunch of sweet things you must get here.- cinnamon challah knot- almond brioche toast - cinnamon crispy - whole grain, oat and nut scone - zucchini, carrot and walnut muffin- carrot cake- red velvet cake - chocolate cherry roll- glazed cinnamon twist - sticky bun with pecans - chocoholic stick- low fat applesauce donut - chocolate hazelnut biscotti - cornmeal lime cookie- kitchen sink cookieAnd those are just their regular goodies that are always on rotation... Amy's also adds a changing lineup of different things depending on the season, such as fluffy hot cross buns near Easter, lemon bars and pies during the Spring and now some strawberry shortcake and strawberry muffins for the Summer. What's even better is that most of their pastries and dessert range from just under a buck to about $3-4. This place may be bad for your waistline, but it sure as hell is easy on the wallet.--P.S.

Years ago, I used to be a bartender and i used to have a fellow Czechoslovakian customer who would stop here from time to time to buy trays and would bring me a plate of varenykys when he came in. Best customer/regular ever and I never forgot them.The varenykys (and yes, that's what they are - even though they put ""pierogi"" on the sign. That's because most people don't know the difference. Varenyky is always boiled while pierogi is usually boiled then fried or baked. This is not pertinent, I'm just giving an FYI). They are so light, sweet, and delicious sauteed in just the right amount of onion. I drove in and picked up a full tray. They're only 50 cents each how can you beat that?!! While i waited, I got a small cup of the Borscht. To my Eastern European relatives chagrin, I have never been a big fan of the beet ,but this was absolutely amazing. Maybe my grandmother was just a terrible cook after all.The hours are limited. Only weekends and it's easy to walk/pass right on by. Look for the big blue Chiropractor's awning.

An extra egg is in order for the next time I come here....When it comes to ramen, the broth and noodles are definitely important factors to decide whether I like the place or not. More importantly, the egg says it all for me. I love my medium-boiled eggs to be somewhat oozing with goodness, which Jin Ramen satisfied me for the first time in awhile! Too bad they only give you half of the egg....For appetizers, my friend and I ordered the chicken karaage, which was delicious and juicy. It was sadly a small portion that came out with small 6 pieces for $6 but what can I expect out of NY. Nowhere has huge portions unless you pay big bucks for it. I ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen which came with delicious fatty pork slices. It was DEFINITELY way better than Ippudo and for some reason, Jin Ramen hit my spot more than Totto that day. Maybe I was deprived of good food after staying up late for countless of hours due to my exams that week.I enjoyed the wooden decor of the ramen joint.

1215,15,15,5.0,"For my 200th review: Grey Lady - Nantucket comes to the Lower East Side.With a prominently seafood inspired menu, The Grey Lady hits a home run. For those of you who don't know, the Grey Lady is the nickname of Nantucket because of the amount of fog around the island. However, there's nothing foggy about this new LES restaurant, as they've hit the New England nautical theme on the head. Fresh daily oyster selections and an excellent lobster roll are the headliners, but this place has a lot going for it. Excellent service, a great bar space, and killer drinks just to name a few. The atmosphere is laid back yet very welcoming. The ladies and I headed over here for a Sunday Funday brunch*. We had an Urban Daddy deal that scored us each a lobster roll and unlimited drinks... Sunday Funday for sure! The space has a big open feel to it with lots of light streaming in, perfect for a Sunday Funday boozy brunch.Our waitress (now our homegirl) Mary was the only server on brunch duty and still managed to do an excellent job keeping up with everyone's requests and making sure we constantly had full cocktails. In short, she was amazing (I promised her a shout out!) The oysters were excellent as was the fresh watermelon and feta salad that we split. The lobster roll was unreal. Granted it is $25 but there was so much lobster falling out of the fresh brioche roll that I had to eat some with a fork before I could dive into my first bite. It also had minimal mayo - a prerequisite for an excellent L-roll** Another friend had the grilled cheese and was impressed. They also have traditional egg and french toast selections for brunch as well. I'd also love to come back for dinner sometime and check out the fresh fish selections. All in all we had a lovely afternoon here, leaving full and happy. Also pretty drunk... thank you unlimited drink deal & very cute bartender!!*Side Note: One of these lovely ladies absolutely HATES the LES and trekked all the way over there from the UWS for the first time in about 3 years due to the prospect of this lobster roll and Nantucketish scene. **The anti-LES friend is also very anti-mayo.

Imagine watching a live jazz band play on stage under the blue lights, and you can see Central Park behind through the massive glass windows. I enjoyed every second of my time here.I would highly recommend making reservations in advance. You can choose to sit either at the bar or at a table. The table is better of course, because you are much closer to the stage, and everything good comes with a price tag. You might have to share a table with random strangers since most people hold up to 4 people. I was unfortunate to have this random guy share my table with me. He was busy scribbling notes throughout the whole concert. I guess he might have to write a review for his homework? Also, he refused to order anything from the menu at first, not till the waitress told him there was a $10 minimum. He ordered a small pie and whenever he cut his pie with a knife, the whole table shook because he was so violent. I enjoyed a glass of harvest apple sangria ($12). It was delicious, and had a generous amount of fruits in it. Considering the fact that its now apple harvest season, this drink could not be more perfect. There is also a 5 course dinner for $95. I don't know if the food is good. Its a good way to save time but I would much rather focus my energy on listening to good music than on working my way through a 5 course meal. The doors open 30min before the start of the show. I went 25 min early but there was already a small line outside the door. So go early! Also, if you have a student ID, you will receive a discount. I would also recommend checking out the after hours show.

1218,11,4,5.0,"Wow. Dined here on their second night in operation. Came in with low expectations and was blown away. Let's start with the food. It's delish. Plain and simple. Inventive and unexpected at every turn, and yet comforting at the same time. Take, for example, the lobster BLT on brioche toast with homemade aioli. Never had a lobster BLT like this, and it's now easily my favorite. That bread is to die for. Same goes for the Brooklyn Lager clam chowder. It was slightly on the salty side, but still oh-so-good. Presentation on everything is also top-notch. Let's not forget we eat with our eyes first. Rock salt decor on my clam chowder - adorable. Curly ""fries"" to accompany the BLT? Amazing. In particular, I love that practically everything is made in house. Oyster crackers? Yep. Cocktail sauce to accompany our giant prawns? Yep. Rocky road ice cream? Of course. And yes, those marshmallows DO melt in your mouth. Literally EVERYTHING here is fresh and homemade.Moving on to the service. In it's first week of operation, I expected service to be down right horrendous. It wasn't. Our waitress was lovely, if slightly over-attentive. But I'd take too much attention over too little any day. These are simple wrinkles that I'm sure the restaurant will have ironed out within a few weeks. The point is, everyone here - from the bartender to the hostess to the wait staff and the owners - EVERYONE is ridiculously friendly. They make L&W feel like a cozy, adorable West Village neighborhood spot, except right here in the middle of NoMad.Finally, no review of L&W is complete without mentioning the decor. The owners did a fantastic job bringing New England / Maine charm to the space, while still maintaining a hip, New York feel. The magnetic poetry on the walls is pure GENIUS and makes for endless entertainment. The overhead candles upon entry are adorable. The pops of red and the button bar stools add just the right amount of whimsy. Overall, I loved it. A much needed addition to the restaurant scene in this area and one of too few really good oyster joints in the city. Will be back. Frequently. Even if I didn't live 2 blocks away.",20,0.9973

1220,14,8,5.0,"When Jungsik first opened in New York, named for Mr. Jung Sik Yim, and a play on Korean for 'fine dining', it was both appreciated and lampooned. The decision to price its tasting menu at the level of EMP was derided as unreasonably bold, but the major reviewers noted that Mr. Yim's cooking was not as far off from that mark as one might expect of an upstart. Having had several months since then to further develop the dishes and incorporate the major critiques leveled against his endeavor, I was eager to see the extent to which he had adapted.Most notably, the three and five course menus were gone, much to the shock of the women dining to the left of Tiffany S. and I. They were instead replaced with an a la carte selection, which in my opinion seemed something of a fool's errand. The prices seemed a touch too steep, so attempting to pick a mere one or two exciting dishes would be akin to buying a third of a box of macarons at four-fifths of the price. As such, the two of us opted for the tasting menu. I mentioned my shellfish allergies, and was given a stunningly generous list of substitutes to choose from. As we confirmed our intentions with our waiter, the general manager, Jin Ahn, welcomed us, sincerely apologizing at the cancellation of our earlier reservation due to the storm, and graciously and unnecessarily offering us champagne on the house. In a sign of the flawless service to come, our amuse swiftly followed the pouring of the champagne. A sesame rice chip, a potato puree, a cold gel of chicken stock, and a smoked tofu tower, which in turn begat bulgogi sliders, with the final amuse being Mr. Yim's take on Korean fried chicken, were placed delicately before us. If it sounds overwhelming, it was. Not that the excitement of the kitchen should be chastised, as it served to showcase some of the textural nuances and truly creative flavor combinations we were in for. Sadly, the bulgogi sliders served more to lull us to sleep, and were underwhelming. Before our first true courses, the sommelier, Kyungmoon Kim, asked if we'd like to see a wine list, and at telling him that we'd be partaking in the wine pairing, grew visibly excited, hurrying (though not unbecomingly) to procure our first bottle. In the meantime, our first course arrived. Tiffany received a silky clam chowder, and I a rich, buttery chestnut soup, along with sumptuous earl grey infused bread, made in-house. As Mr. Kim returned, we were given detailed but interesting rationales behind our selections of wines; a pattern that continued appreciably throughout our meal. The wines that we had the pleasure of being served were all matched to our food immaculately, my substitutions included. Mr. Kim has compiled an incredible list, and has gone to great lengths to alternately balance and enrich Mr. Yim's cuisine. What followed our soups was a foie gras with an apple gelee that left the two of us bewildered. What a simple idea for needed acidity, and what wonderful execution. Execution which was rivaled in the fantastic wagyu tartare, with its interplay of somehow opulent egg yolk and firm, savory beef. My mushroom dish, submerged under a beautifully poached egg and Parmesan crisp sung of dashi, kimchi, and umami. The octopus in ssamjang aioli was tender perfection, and with the slightest hint of salinity. The bossam that followed was the opposite extreme, nearly disturbingly crunchy, but equally delicious, interspersed with lettuce and negi, though thankfully forgoing the clumsy wrap structure. Though my Classic Fish was a fine take on black cod, in a moat of smoked red pepper, I much preferred my partner's snapper, sitting in a bed of cilantro and jalapeno puree, though I couldn't enjoy the clam broth below. The scales had been left on, and fried in oil, leaving them delightfully crisp. The kimchi steak jus, sadly, had a bit too much heat for the wagyu, and was the first and only true miss of the night for my palate. In a meal of so many dishes, that is quite a showing. The desserts quickly redeemed the minor misstep, with the omija granite serving as a perfect palate cleanser before the stunningly rich pumpkin cheesecake. The artfulness of the plating of Jonghun Wong should be commended. Crystalline leaves evoke fall as successfully as the pumpkin cheesecake itself.In truth, though it be high praise, Jungsik provided one of the finest meals I've had the pleasure of enjoying. Along with that, the staff are truly exemplary to a (wo)man. It has truly earned its Michelin star, and I felt a creeping sadness at the half-empty dining room. In an era where a Michelin star does not have the cachet it once did, given some of its more questionable recipients(Rouge Tomate), nor does it ensure continued success(Picholine), word of mouth once more returns to the forefront of generating excitement in fine dining. I cannot urge you any more vociferously to go to Jungsik. There are extraordinarily few restaurants more deserving of your time and attention.",24,0.9993

For the chicken finger lover in everyone, this place is as close to Heaven on Earth as you'll find. The actual ""joint"" is not so large inside, so mayybe be prepared to take your order to go. Luckily, my friend and I went on a rainy evening, so we basically had the whole place to ourselves. SUPER friendly staff that offered great recommendations and were genuinely curious to know how our food was. Let's break it down:General Sticky Tso fingers with Thai Sweet Chili sauce = amazingly delicious; a faveSalted Caramel Pretzel fingers with Sticky's Sauce and classic BBQ = sooo good, if a little tough to cut through with plastic utensilsTruffle Fries = excellent, though as others have pointed out, they don't skimp on the truffle oilSweet Potato Fries = basically candyWe only ordered 3 fingers with each entree and still it was too much food. This is a great place to split items, especially the sides since they are very generous helpings.Everything was so good that I can't help but want to try all of them. And because these are rather ""artisanal"" fingers, the guilt just never surfaces. (Not that I ever feel guilty ordering a chicken finger.)Support this Joint! It's great. And if you ever need a chicken finger buddy . . . well, call me!",28,0.982
1222,5,3,5.0,"I think this is the only worthwhile pork belly in Manhattan. Usually I make the 1.5+ hour trip from Brooklyn to Flushing to get my fix. This isn't quite as good as Hahm Ji Bak in Flushing (very close, though!), but for some reason it IS better than the Han Joo in Flushing. I think it's the service. Hopefully it wasn't just because they just opened, and they maintain that level of customer care. The pork belly probably tastes better at this location because the waitress was very attentive and made sure it was cooked *perfectly*. She was also diligent about replenishing all the side dishes.With a generous tip, it came to $25/pp for a big, satisfying, well rounded meal. We didn't get any alcohol, though. Overall, not bad! I also really appreciate it when restaurants don't try to tack on extra charges- barley tea, rice, unlimited side dishes, multiple dipping sauces, etc, are all included. This is how it should be!! I was there on their second night open, and already they had a good number of customers. I have a feeling it may be hard to get a seat soon on a Friday night. I know I'll be a regular, and so will a lot of my friends!",6,0.9906
1223,6,3,5.0,"2nd Ave deli is probably the best, most consistent Jewish deli I've been to. Born out of the ashes of the famous original from the East Village by a younger member of the family that has taken over, this place continues to churn out great classic Eastern-European Jewish cuisine. The setup is a little odd, as they have the counter in the front and the rest of the dining room is split in half and separated by panels. I don't know why they do this as it's very weird and confining; for privacy, perhaps? Service can eithet be efficient if impersonable, or freaking hilarious depending on who you get. If you get one of the old Jews, they're awesome: this is all I'll say. The owner is usually hanging around in the front as well, so say hi. But as much as the culture of the deli is interesting, the food is the reason we come.Everytime I come here I get a pastrami sandwich, which is probably the best I've had. It can vary a bit based on visit, but not by much. It is aromatic, meaty, peppery, and delicately fatty all at once. They also don't skimp on the meat, like most Jewish delis. The rye bread also stands out from the normal cardboard-ish variety, and they may make it themselves. I've gotten the matzoh ball soup on occasion and it is also among the best I've had. The broth is subtle and filled with ample schmaltz, while the ball itself is soft, buttery and delcious without dominating the bowl. The pickles, pickled tomatoes and cole slaw they bring is all good as well as a value-add. In particular the pickles are so good that I even eat the half sours. The meal is finished with a shot of a malty chocolate beverage (a sort of kosher egg cream), which some are wild about, some hate, and I just enjoy. It's a good cap to the meal, and something that they really don't have to offer. A meal from here with a Black Cherry Dr. Brown's is one of the most satisfying meals I can imagine. As someone who is Jewish but did not grow up religious or even liking the food really, that is a bizarre statement I never thought I'd make. Sure it is expensive, but you also get what you pay for. There is a reason David Sax framed his study of Jewish Delis--""Save the Deli""--around his experiences here. 2nd Ave Deli is the real deal, and if you don't like it then feel free to go to go one of the many tourist trap delis instead. More room for me and my ever-expanding girth.",11,0.9952
1224,10,19,5.0,"Forcella restaurants are three siblings, each with a personality of their own.There is the oldest sibling - artist/singer/songwriter sharing a living space in a loft in Billyburg,- Forcella on Lorimer st. You got your middle sibling, who hangs out in the East Village every night and has the lowdown on all the bars, bands, and Bowery in general. - Forcella on Bowery.And last but not least - the youngest sibling, who actually ended up getting a job, now, shaves regularly, and wears nice clothes to work. - Forcella on Park Ave.This youngest sibling establishment has a lot to be proud of. I mean - Park Avenue, fully stocked bar, my favorite oven that's been imported from Naples that makes incredible pizza (the chefs have something to do with it too, I am sure). Winning a Time-Out award for best pizza in NY, Forcella was already in the big leagues playing with the big boys, but this young sibling is about to trump everything and redefine a whole new level of success for the Forcella family. I already knew that the pizza would be incredible, so I'll spare you the details of fried ""Montanara"" pizza melting in your mouth as no crumb gets left behind from the most delicious dough and sauce you have ever had in your life. Craved it. Had it. Wanted more. Nothing new.Let's talk about the appetizers instead. kobe beef sliders==============So I came here to get very specific taste buds hit - the ones that can only be hit by a good red sauce - you know what I am talking about - the kind made from fresh ingredients imported from Napoli. These sliders definitely cleansed my palette and for a good 3 minutes, made me forget about fried pizza. The perfect ratio of fat to meat, the flawless medium-rare preparation, topped off with some arugula leaves - I could have just filled up on those, Harold & Kumar style, and would have been completely satisfied. grilled octopus============Need an appetizer pairing for your Happy Hour drink? How about a little of this? I've had it Hibachi style, I've had it Mongolian Grill style. This, however, was a completely new flavor profile for me. All I tasted was fresh octopus and a light hint of oil. No extra or filler spices/sauces to mask the lack of freshness. I am sure there were other ingredients, but I was enjoying this as a simple patron, instead of a yelper/foodie for once.gold-leaf covered risotto===================Alright... if the gold-leaf doesn't say ""We're #1"", I don't know what does. Oh wait - how about an abundance of truffle oil and saffron? Just by looking at a risotto like this, you know that you are about to have a foodgasm*. The soft, carefully cooked risotto bursting with flavor is how it should be done. Chef Giulio can probably whip this up in his sleep and definitely sets the bar for other restaurants and chefs.conclusion=========If I ever write a book entitled ""How To Make Park Avenue My Bitch,"" I am going to stop by and take some notes from these guys. I congratulate them on the success of their youngest sibling and look forward to eating in, as well as converting my entire office to Montanara as the pizza of choice for Pizza Fridays. 5 stars as always.---------* I am deeply sorry for using this word. I hate it myself - not as much as ""nom,"" but still... the recollection of my meal is causing me to salivate profusely and is making me dizzy, thereby directly affecting my food vocabulary.",17,0.9984

Nice job. Tuna, Yellowtail, and Salmon - down the hatch you go.It was so good - we ordered an extra serving of white tuna sashimi (a personal favorite of yours truly)As we were pounding the food, a cold bottle of unfiltered Nigori was the perfect beverage compliment.Caitlin ordered a couple more rolls as she wanted to get her eel fix and I just shared off her plates.Hana was a cool experience - the service was great (always smiling) and the food/sake hit the spot.Well played.",6,0.99
1226,6,8,5.0,"Believe it or not, I normally don't even like pasta and would typically would never choose to eat it. However, the one exception is Japanese pasta - it was one of the things I loved to eat the most when I went to visit Japan. It was always perfectly chewy, not too heavy on the sauce, tasty and altogether delightful. I first heard about Basta Pasta from a coworker when I was talking about how much I missed Japanese pasta. I've been dying to try it ever since and I finally made it out there this weekend! I went with three of my friends from out of town for dinner. The ambiance was great - simple, fresh, clean, white. The kitchen is basically an open area in the middle of the restaurant, which I really appreciated.Basing my decision off of the Yelp reviews, I shared the sea urchin and the spaghetti con prosciutto e parmigiano with a friend. Both were delicious and I have trouble deciding which one I liked more, though I think the uni was more unique! The first was the perfect combination of very fresh, delicious uni and tomato. I also loved the parmesan and prosciutto combination - it is prepared in a large bowl of parmesan right in front of the table! My friend from Japan, who I would believe to be the expert in all things Japanese pasta, actually said this is the best pasta she's had in her life.Highlight of the meal...I was so ecstatic about eating this amazing pasta that I happily declared, ""I am so happy...it feels like there are explosions of happiness bursting inside of me!"" We all paused for a beat and then burst out laughing while I attempted to hide my horrified face. I am slightly embarrassed to share this publicly but I promised my friends I would include this in my review haha. To summarize, this pasta is absolutely amazing and heaven sent.

1227,5,2,5.0,"Having eaten at Masa - Neta definitely made me reminisce of that time. I had the $125 Tasting (they have a a $95 option which is ""less exotic"") that has 11 courses. By the end, you have very happily filled stomach. You can see photos of all 11 courses posted on yelp so I won't get into all of them, but the main highlights:Cocktail Glass with Toro and Caviar - this is supposedly on the menu for $48 but you get it as part of the tasting. They give you warm bread on the side to eat with it - I ate all the bread which was sad, bc i really wanted to stick my tongue into the glass to lick the remaining toro and caviar - but clearly this wouldn't have looked the best in such a nice placeToro Sushi - slightly darker pink color... in fact, what is great about all the sushi is how perfectly balanced they have the amount of rice to sushi. You don't feel as though either side is lacking or too much. Also, they have a nice wet napkin in a small dish for you to cleanse your fingers after eating each (they encourage you to eat with your fingers)The cocktails drinks are pricey ($15) and you don't get too much - to be honest, I would have skipped this and just had water as the food has enough flavor on its own.Definitely must go to place... PS They apparently do serve blowfish to their regulars - i didn't realize this, else I would have requested to add that to my meal!!",5,0.9919
1228,7,7,5.0,"Lillie's is pretty much what you'd see if you entered the special corners of my brain. It's decorated elegantly, the ceilings are high, the windows are pieces of artwork.... and the drinks are strong as hell.I love the detail in the surroundings - I know it's mostly about the food and drink, but there is something to be said in the old school, class-ful feel of this place. No shiny, modern plastic here! The sitting area towards the back of the place is elevated.. I looked like a melting slug getting in and out of these seats (mostly because I was pretty tips and I am pretty shorts).Come to think of it... I actually like that you can be seated, and at a face to face (almost) level with friends, servers, and the managers - who actually continue to check up on you! Danielle (the night manager when I went) was great - friendly and attentive. The manager working before her (I think her name was Lynn?) even checked in on the tables before her shift ended. The ambiance and service of Lillie's is a lost art.The drinks were strong.. which means perfect and delicious. Well worth your hard earned dollars. The food was surprising good also - I always thought it was just a bar, meaning: a pit stop before the restaurant, but there were a good number of tables who were obviously there for the food. Food crowds/seats in the rear, the bar and the noise up front - I appreciated the division.It's located super close to Times Square which, admittingly, is slightly cringe-worthy... except everyone works in mid-town!

I passed by this location the other day and couldn't wait to try it! We miss our old usual spot.Last night, my friend Nat and I finally made it for dinner. We could barely contain our excitement! The space at this location is a lot more roomier, and has a nice, modern look to it. The decor is really cool, with the lit up cases on the side wall and a large bar area. This is definitely a larger space than downtown, and can accommodate a much larger crowd. We were immediately greeted by the hostess and some familiar faces from the old location. To our surprise, the manager came over to us and said he recognized us and was so glad to see some old regulars! Before we got the menu, we already knew what we wanted to order. After ordering up a round of red sangria, one of our favorites, the Papas Bravas was definitely our first choice- this is small fried potatoes served with different dipping sauces. Be careful when you eat this, as they do make it fresh and it is very hot when you first get it. We also got the meatballs and oxtail with truffle oil mashed potato in red wine sauce. The oxtail surprised us the most because it was something new we were trying. This was such an amazingly delicious dish, we cannot wait to come back and have it again! Coming here was a delight and we are glad to say that Lizarran hasn't lost anything about itself from the old location, but rather upgraded into something more modern and awesome!

Or as Busta Rhymes would say, ""WHOA HAH!""Rusty and I were walking by after shooting some hoops and reading some Stephen King (yes, we're hipsters) when I finally spotted Margie's! It's hard to spot, but we decided to pop in to check out their menu. We were greeted by such a friendly (and small) staff. The inside was surprisingly clean and bold. Random adornments that added so much charm. We were sold on the place and promised to come back before the end of next week...Low and behold, we ended up there that night, we just couldn't wait. They were happy to see us and we were happy that the place wasn't crowded at 8 p.m.We sat down and I pretty much already knew what I wanted. They serve breakfast all day, so that made it easy. I got the salmon cakes entree. Usually it comes with grits, home-fries, eggs and a corn biscuit, however, I had eggs and grits for breakfast so they allowed me to substitute the grits for a side salad.Rusty got three of the sides (mac and cheese, collard greens and potato salad). Did I mention we're not eating meat until Thanksgiving? Hence why there was no ordering of smothered turkey wings or fried chicken. Shucks y'all.The food is cooked to order, which I appreciate, which I love, which I respect. At first, they were sad to tell me that I'd only be getting one salmon cake (chef needed to make more), which I was okay with. We waited for a bit longer and were so delighted when our food came.Portions are perfect. Not out of control. And they were able to make me two salmon cakes! Score! My salmon cakes were perfectly fried, not greasy or salty, just hot, fresh and flavorful! I wish mine were this good! Coupled with the delicious home fries and the simple refreshing house salad, this was killer. Russell's sides were also dabommmm. The mac and cheese was not too cheesy, not too salty, again, perfect balance of ingredients. The greens (no ham hocks here!) were so hot and fragrant and not too soft. I hate when greens are overcooked. Lastly the potato salad tasted just like my mother's. I am not lying. Mom, I love you...but this place has stolen your recipe. No condiments needed, no napkins to blot grease, I just reveled in this deliciously satisfying meal. While we were eating, Michael, one of the friendly servers at Margie's greeted us with a cornmeal muffin. This thing was to die for. Do they grind up the corn for their meal in the kitchen? I don't know, but it sure tastes like it.While we were eating, business picked up with some regulars and some other newbies like us. All guests were treated with warmth and affection. This is what I appreciate the most in an establishment...business owners that I appreciate their customers. Even though it was only our first time I here, I felt like we were being welcomed into someone's home, not just another restaurant.Despite being full, we were tempted into trying the Lemonaid Pie. Interesting Reminiscent of lemon meringue but much lighter texture. Rus and I shared a slice and it was the perfect way to end our meal.If you're in a rush, this might not be your first stop (although you can call ahead, it seems, for faster service). But really, why rush? Our culture needs to learn how to appreciate food and hospitality again...Enjoy yourself, enjoy your food, enjoy your company and enjoy your hostess.This meal was only $28 including tip. Nothing on the menu is more than $12 or $13. They will be serving brunch starting next weekend as well. Small, but quaint, comfortable. Real, and I mean REAL HOME-COOKING.

The very brunchy bellini my boyfriend ordered was to sweet for me but he enjoyed it very much.We had the small meat and cheese plate, which was pretty phenomenal. Truffle lard is the new black in my book. That is all. The cheeses were fantastic, the salumi had just enough spice and enough fat - what was absolutely surreal were the toast points.

Ok, I changed my mind - to die for.Beet salad - I wish the red beets were sliced thinner. God, how messed up of me. On second thought, no, I don't. I do wish there was goat cheese there. Ok, there.

1235,10,7,5.0,"Going to Agra is kind of like visiting a speakeasy. Despite a relatively large awning and being able to see the second floor restaurant through windows across the street, the actual entrance is not immediately transparent. Instead, you go up to the door and it's a residential building. You hit the second floor buzzer and the restaurant rings you in. No password required however, but it still has an air of mystery about it (in a fun way).The interior of Agra is designed to take you to another world. Wood floors, red everywhere, paintings, some nice moldings and dim (but not dark) lighting all help transport you away from the bustling city outside. The staff is super friendly and welcomes you with proverbial open arms. Though I was new to this place, I felt like I was coming over to a friend's house.A bit of perspective: I grew up living downstairs from an Indian family that would frequently babysit me. So from the age of 6 I was already eating ""home style"" Indian food, so my tastes were determined very early on for such cuisine. I find most Indian places in NYC disappointing, but every now and then you find a gem and Agra counts as one! To the food:LIVER POORI (mildly spiced chicken liver, cooked with chopped onions)I know, I know...""Ew, liver!"" some people will say, but I grew up eating chicken gizzards so liver is just a part of the bird to me, not something to be tossed away. For those who are squeamish, don't bother with this dish. For those into livers and those sorts of meats, this is a delicious treat! The liver is super tender and has a great texture. The onion sauce it sits in is heavenly and it is served with a piece of fried bread that is crisp and tasty. The entire dish is VERY rich, so while not large, it will definitely satisfy.CHANA SHAG (chickpeas cooked in a mild spinach sauce)Chana Shag is one of the more dependable dishes. I've rarely had a bad one but when it is bad, it's usually because it's too dry or salty. In this case the term ""mild"" is correct. The flavor is very mellow and doesn't overwhelm anything else you're having. While it is an entree, I think the flavor lends itself to being a side a bit more. The texture was perfect, with the spinach being creamy and the chick peas being delicate but still having bite.CHICKEN TANDOORI (chicken on the bone marinated and seasoned in herbs and spices, grilled in clay oven)Probably one of the best things you can have in an Indian restaurant when watching your weight. This chicken was absolutely delicious, and served on a hot, iron plate still sizzling. Bits of fat left on the sides were practically attached to the plate as you peeled its awesomeness off. The chicken was flavorful, juicy, tender and the meat peeled right off the bone with a fork. This isn't always the case with this dish (which more often than not, winds up too dry) so I was very impressed.GARLIC NAN (nan layered with garlic and spices)One of my favorite add ons to any Indian meal. The nan here is a bit crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. The garlic on top is really nice and there isn't an excessive amount of oil weighing it down (as I've had in other restaurants). The garlic flavor isn't overwhelming either. Rather, it's just right and enhances the flavor of any food you have with it.KASHMIR NAN (nan layered with raisins, almonds and coconut grits)To clarify, ""coconut grits"" does not refer to Southern styled grits with coconut flavor. Instead, this is almost like a dessert nan. The nan is the same as the garlic nan, but instead of garlic, it's topped with the sweet ingredients mentioned above, including toasted coconut shreds. It was heavenly and actually would have made a fine dessert on its own! This was a new one to me so I'm really happy it came out so well.GULAM JAMUN (deep fried cottage cheese rounded dipped in rum syrup)Most of the time, restaurants serve smaller, dumpling sized gulam jamun as a dessert. Not so here. Instead, you get one large one (probably about the size of 2-3 from another restaurant) and it sits in a tasty, hot syrup. This dessert is an exercise in flavor and textures. The fried cheese portion is a light, airy item with a wonderful chew to it. It's very soft and practically melts in your mouth. This is helped by the hot syrup it sits in (I actually recommend letting it cool for a minute or so when you get it) which permeates every inch of the cheese. Absolutely one of my favorite desserts!Agra is one of my favorite Indian places in the city now, and I enjoy its rather ""mysterious"" location.

So when Friday rolls around and I want awesome hair to kick my weekend off right, you know I'm trolling their app for an appointment. The subterranean space is a tad small, and while it can feel claustrophobic without any windows and sunshine, I don't think any of that matters when you walk in bright and early and someone offers you a coffee and coiffure. Just like it's first NYC location downtown, the atmosphere is cheery, with framed mirrors, yellow and gray accents...mercy me. I have to say, the stylists in this location seem to be a bit more on their A-game than downtown as well. They always do my hair perfectly, and for the most part it stays all day, and let's all be honest for a minute...when you have a fabulous blow out, don't you just walk around like you are hot stuff?Let's not forget that Drybar boasts a $40 blow out, so I can actually afford to go, plus I don't mind forking over my money to the friendly staff who keep my credit card on file so the entire thing is super fast and easy...which is especially important to get to work on time, all the while looking fantastic. If you haven't been to the Drybar at all, then you probably have bad hair. Sorry, but someone had to tell you. If you haven't been to the one in midtown, please don't become a patron, because it's hard enough getting an appointment as it is. And if the owner, Alli, is reading this, please please please open another location, preferably on the Upper East Side? 86th Street could really use you. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Blowdry bar win.",11,0.9886

1242,8,6,5.0,"Review update in the spirit of the month of July Yelp challenge: Summer Sweet Treats!For the purpose of the July challenge, I will just cut to the chase and talk about the dessert I had at L'Artusi the other night, on July 1st. I had already fallen in love with the desserts here the first time I visited, when I had the dulce de leche panna cotta with bruleed bananas and a chocolate hazelnut tort. So of course I knew just how imperative it was to order dessert again; in fact I'm sure it's a no brainer to get dessert during every single visit. Go big or go home, right?Anyway, so the dessert I want to talk about here is the raspberry tiramisu. This beautiful trifle-like dessert was layered with smooth, sweet raspberry mousse, raspberry liquor infused lady fingers, and fresh whipped cream, studded with market fresh raspberries. While the traditional tiramisu has always been one of my favorite Italian desserts, I thoroughly enjoyed this twist on the espresso-flavored dessert, and the bf liked it a lot too because he's not a fan of anything coffee related. The mousse was perfect in texture and bold in flavor, which was well balanced by the delicate whipped cream and soft lady fingers. The entire thing came together well, and actually wasn't too sweet which I really appreciated. I also appreciate that the dessert menu at L'Artusi always changes through the seasons, as I love nothing more than a seasonally focused menu that utilizes market ingredients. The dainty little raspberries in this tiramisu was exactly what you'd look for in a summer treat! For a picture of the dessert: yelp.com/biz_photos/rp8S… As always, the service here is top-notch and the ambiance super classy. For the sake of the July challenge, I'd suggest just popping in for a seat at the bar to enjoy some wine, a light bite, and some of their beautifully-executed desserts.",9,0.9964

In all major aspects, this place was just right.They have a nice lay out, great atmosphere, classy yet comfortable vibe and an outdoor patio. I am a big fan of outdoor patios, so to me, this was a huge perk.This would be a perfect place to have a first date (we counted 3 of them happening while we were there). The mood lighting is nice and the crowd is more young adult instead of college kids. Good drink menu, fast service, and chill place. I would go back. I would also highly recommend this place for a date.",19,0.9856
1244,19,18,5.0,"I came for the ramen but I found much much more! I'm a ramen nut so when I heard about their Beef Trifecta noodles I just had to give it a whirl!I dropped by on an early Sunday evening with a few friends and was seated quickly without a reservation. I was expecting the typical cramped Japanese noodle bar but stumbled into a restaurant with a lot of tables and a full bar... SCORE! (I totally dig the decor).It took me a second to orient myself but I knew I was in for something different. The appetizers menu read like a Chinese dim sum menu but with a twist. Why just have ordinary Shao Mei when you can have... Truffle oil Shao Mei?? Regular shrimp dumplings or ""White Jade Bunny"" Shrimp Dumplings?? Regular beef dumplings or Steak & Provolone Cheese Pan Fried Dumplings?? We're in the West Village and witnessing some sort of Asian dim sum enlightenment here. Shoot... you can even get your fix of crab meat soup dumplings at Niu. Are you following me? I came for the ramen but here I am raving about the appz! My suggestion is to come in even number groups so you can share these dishes evenly. My fave is probably the pan fried flank steak & provolone cheese dumplings with the truffle Shai Mei coming in a close second. But I'm not done. I came for the Beef Trifecta Noodle Soup did I not? This is a fantastic bowl of noodles that includes Flank Steak, Short Ribs & Beef Shank with your choice of noodle and soup base. You can choose between 6 different types of noodles and 3 different soup bases (that's 18 combinations.. I think). I went with the Egg Noodle and Spicy Niu Special Soup which was ridiculously good. First off, they have this cute little chopstick/green onion holder in the shape of their cow logo hanging on the bowl. The darn thing is so friggin cute. Love details much? There's also this awesome wasabi flavored seaweed tempura on top of the noodles which I wished they would serve as an app or complimentary community dish. The beef was delish...like they came off a KBBQ grill. The broth was savory with that noticeable but not overbearing spice kick. and the noodles? I didn't know this beforehand...but found out that these Niu noodles are hand made daily! Bounce Bounce in yo mouth! Yo... I said... I'm not done!I'm pretty full right about now but the waiter (Chris?) was recommending their shaved ice dessert. If you've ever had Wooly's or any Taiwanese shaved ice... you know you can't resist this light and fluffy dessert. What the hell.. I took the leap and ordered the Mango flavored shaved ice. This was probably one of the best endings to a great meal... I'm thinking they can probably sell thousands of this dessert in a separate operation altogether. Why hide it tucked away on the bottom of a dessert menu? GET THIS. Ok, I think I covered everything. Now I'm done.",24,0.9963

1246,8,20,5.0,"Two reviews in one: Restaurant week and then the Omakase dining experience.1) RESTAURANT WEEK --- I had my first Morimoto experience when I came here for lunch with two friends. I knew that the food wouldn't be the BEST that Morimoto had to offer, but I was still interested to see what kind of fare we would get. Among the three of us, we got the braised black cod and the wagyu beef. The lunch was served bento box style. Each bento box came with the following: 1) miso soup, which had huge pieces of tofu in it. 2) Salad. 3) 3 pieces of sashimi, 3 pieces of sushi with white ginger. 4) Vegetable tempura (asparagus and scallion) with a cheese based dipping sauce. For $24-ish it was not a bad deal at all. The best part of the meal was the dessert! The Green Tea Panna Cotta was freaking delicious. I think the dessert is what cemented my decision to return for dinner.2) OMAKASE --- I came back a few weeks later for dinner. We decided to go with the Omakase menu, which is an extremely common practice in Japan. Basically in Japan, you pull up a seat and your entire menu is up to the chef. (but in Japan you can pay whatever you think your meal was worth... whereas you can't get away with that here!). The Omakase menu usually goes from lighter to heavier fare. For example, we started with some raw selections and worked our way up to the with surf and turf, finally ending with dessert.In my opinion, the Omakase is TOTALLY worth the price, and if you want the fullest dining experience at Morimoto's you need to get it. It's $125 per person. The chef included items that I would have never thought to order on my own, such as the oyster with foie gras. It was one of my favorite dishes that night. I saw some people ordering Omakase for the entire table... no no! That's just awkward. This is a 7-10 course menu, each plate is going to have small servings. Plus, it doesn't make sense to split a piece of sushi 3 ways!LASTLY, you need to use the bathroom there. Just GO even if you don't have to ""go."" The toilets are badays and are heated! I would totally stop by in the middle of winter just to warm up my patoot!",15,0.9663

From our croquette appetizers to the light and mildly spicy Mac and cheese to the pomegranate mojito (2-for-1 happy hour until 8) to the chef's choice three course dessert menu (the yuzu tofu cheesecake and signature sweet tofu were highlights, disappointed by the green tea creme brûlée), our meal was made to perfection.

The mapo tofu, we asked for extra spicy and that it was. but if you read any of my reviews, i'm immuned to spicy food (except for that damn buffalo cantina). so i ate it like a man while my friend was tearing up and nasty snot was running out her nose. disgusting. whatever, i'm still hungry. i take a bite into the chicken wings, which is covered with dry red chili peppers. let me tell you, its the BEST DAMN CHICKEN WINGS i ever had. and i've had a lot. the price was reasonable, around $10 for a large dish and $7 for a small dish. the service was very fast and friendly. 5 stars mission. well done, i'll be back for the chicken wings...and the free beer. p.s. come early, if you come after 7, be prepared to wait an hour or more and they don't take reservations. other notes, they only serve beer and wine and they actually accept credit cards. they even have take out if you don't want to wait. click useful for my review people. i've given you everything you need to know, you unappreciative bastards.",27,0.9945
1249,35,26,5.0,"I know that I should eat a bit more of a ""cleaner"" diet and sometimes I get the urge to try out going vegan/vegetarian, but the meat eater in me is in a constant battle with that thinking. It's like I have a devil sitting on one shoulder and an angel on the other constantly at odds. Well, at least for one night the angel won.Cafe Blossom made me totally think that I could actually enjoy the organic vegan lifestyle. Too bad I could never really cook the delicious plates that I tasted last night!Seriously, everything that we ordered last night was tremendous and tasted wonderful. At times I look at vegan food to be a bit bland, but the menu here is quite eclectic and full of intense aromas and flavor. Even the setting with it's subdued red walls, quiet music, and candle lit atmosphere offers an ambiance catering to an enjoyable relaxing meal exploring the vegan landscape. Looking over the menu we wanted to try everything! Alas, we had to settle for a only a few things. Our waitress, Penelope, was super sweet and friendly and offered some perfect suggestions for our first meal here. She suggested some drinks and we started off with the Strawberry Berry Sangria which was refreshingly intense and filled with blueberries too. As an appetizer we chose the Chickpea Fritters with sauteed ratatouille. This was totally not what I thought it would be and had a creamy consistency with a light crispy outside. As there were three pieces we had to fight over who got more. The main plates? Both terrific and totally different. Seitan Marsala with sage potato cake, sautéed garlic spinach, poached pear, shallot and thyme marsala reduction. Sautéed Mushroom Risotto with scallion, miso mustard cashew cream, fried leek, carrot, and cilantro. Holy taste bud assault! The seitan had an intense smokey flavor to it and everything on the plate complimented it perfectly. It makes you forget about eating meat or poultry, as this is in a category all it's own. Plus, such a large amount is served on the plate that there is no skimping here. The risotto was creamy and rich. Full of mushrooms and bold flavor. Even though this is quite a filling bowl I could not stop eating it and actually had to finally give up. As sides we had the sauteed asparagus with lemon, and grilled corn with a chipotle style sauce. Both were just a perfect accompaniment to the overall meal which was fabulous.Seriously, we were stuffed after this and could not even make room for dessert! Will have to go back, as we saw some people near us raving about it. I must also note that the plating presentation is a joy to the eyes. Plates that are made of slate, bowls that have a futuristic look, and wine bottles on the table holding water. The location itself is a chic bistro with a very warm feel, but totally representative for this part of town in the West Village. Candles everywhere. They also have a full bar with some organic beer and wines to choose from. There is even a whole downstairs room that would be perfect for private parties and group dining affairs. Even the bathrooms are clean and elegant with a coed sink area in between them. What more can I say? This was a flawless meal. The food choices are totally vegan with a unique flair and prepared perfectly. You pay a little extra for expertly made vegan fare, and this is totally worth it. From the attentive service, to the stylish yet simple surroundings, to the fantastic food selections, Cafe Blossom is a joy to the palate and a must visit for those who enjoy the vegan lifestyle, or just looking to take a walk on the meatless side for a while.",42,0.9989
1250,16,14,5.0,"I may have fallen in love... Let me tell you the object of my affection is sexy as hell! Nope, not a new man in my life but a fabulous Jazz lounge in Tribeca. My mom was in town for the weekend and I wanted to take her somewhere special, somewhere swanky and somewhere we could get dressed up and really feel like we were having a New York night out on the town. Silver Lining fit the bill perfectly. Everyone we were greeted by and waited on could not have been nicer or more accommodating. They showed us over to the best table in the house as the Jazz Trio was getting ready to start their set. The space itself is larger than I thought it would be with tiny tables for two in front of the band area or up on a balcony if you want to be able to have more of a conversation. There are booths in the back for larger groups and a great bar area as well that I'd happily grab a drink at. However, I do think Silver Lining would be best for a date when you want to impress somebody (Gentlemen take note!) Our server Louis was fantastic. He made us laugh and had great recommendations. Mom and I never even looked at a cocktail menu, just told him what our favorite spirits are, which resulted in a wonderfully citrus lemon Vodka drink for Mom and an amazing ginger Bourbon beverage for me. The cocktails were absolutely fabulous and came with a metal stirring straw and large singular ice cube - now who doesn't love that? We ended up ordering some snacks as well and I can assure you the food is just as tasty as the cocktails. We got two orders of sliders, the lamb and the veggie. They will also accommodate you so you can also mix and match them in an order. Both were great, the lamb one was possibly the best lamb burger I've ever had in NYC. To top it all off, the music is just as good as the drinks and food! We sat back and listened to the Jazz, sipped our cocktails and just let all of our troubles melt away. I really don't see how anyone could have a bad night at Silver Lining or leave feeling anything other than total bliss and infatuation. Put this place on your list pronto!",20,0.9989

To our surprise, my fiance and I had one of the most creative, fun and tasty meals ever.We opted for the 5 course tasting which is a bargain at $68/person. The chef started us out with a beautiful and elegant cucumber amuse bouche. Next we were treated to a cucumber gazpacho with a pastrami artic char centerpiece. It was fresh and light on the palate. Sweetbreads with grilled watermelon cubes was our next course. The chef used a clever watermelon juice based sauce to finish the dish - who knew watermelon juice would be used in a savory sauce? Our third course was probably the best: poached egg and lobster under a covering of hen of the woods mushrooms, finished with pumpernickel foam. The textures of the hen of the mushrooms, airy foam and soft poached egg formed the perfect threesome. My final savory course consisted of just three ingredients: filet mignon, carrots and peas. But the presentation was unlike anything I've ever seen. The carrots and the peas were set up to look like an alice and wonderland landscape. A one inch wide, six inch across layer of peas puree was the base for a mini jungle of carrots and peas shoots. My words won't do it justice, take a look at my pictures to see the amazing artistry. Dessert was a trio of sorbets and fresh fruit over a line of rice pudding. A light but perfect end to the meal.Wolfgang Ban and Eduard Frauneder are doing some amazing work in midtown.

1257,6,3,5.0,"The Toucan & The Lion - you have done Mara PROUD (she's actually doing very well herself in Long Island).This sibling dinner with me and Michelle W. had taken at least a month of planning to accommodate both our busy schedules. The main catalyst for us to make this trip down to East Village was the ScoutMob 50%/$25 max coupon. We arrived for our 7PM reservations and were seated in the empty restaurant. By the time we left, the dining room was PACKED so I highly recommend calling ahead for reservations.We started off with the Scotch Eggs and how could you not? The different textures from the crispy duck sausage to the gooey egg yolk played wonderfully off each other. Each ""egg"" was about the half size of a baby's fist, which was extremely generous of the restaurant. Our eggs were followed by Duck Confit Mofongo, again the restaurant dazzled us with two simple ingredients: eggs and duck meat. Michelle educated me on the Puerto Rican heritage of Mofongo's but our dish was Asiatic in nature with Lap Chang (Chinese sausage) and a taro mash. Our mains were on deck and I was completely blown away. First, the lesser of the two, the Goat Pot Pie. So simple in design, yet elegant in execution. It was basically braised goat meat in massaman curry with sweet potatos and two flavored roti's, which completed the dish.Then the jewel of the night. The burger. Again, another simple design (with a simpler name) and a result that was mind-blowing. A quick caveat emptor, the burger here is cooked rarer than most, so I would suggest getting a medium if you're such to medium rare.Anyway, on to the burger. Applewood smoked bacon, cashew nut butter and ground meat on a chinese bao (bun), perfectly toasted to a gentle crisp on the outside yet soft, sweet and warm on the inside. I would have been perfectly satiated with JUST the bao. When it all came together, it was simply a surreal experience. The sweetness from the bao and butter were perfect for the thick, smokey bacon and wonderfully juicy meat. Needless to say, my half of the burger was gone faster than Michelle could take a picture. Then there were the pickles. Fresh pickles encased by perfect batter, literally perfect and literally indescribable. Just order it and you'll know what I mean.I had an amazing dinner with two appetizers and two entrees, which was ridiculously filling. I would suggest to just go 2/1 or 1/2 in app/entree.

Walking through is like a cozy living room, cocktails imbibing, conversations unfolding, even some private rooms that look more like an Arab tent in the desert. We head further to the back, and enter a small room with a waist level table in the middle. It's a unique setup as bars usually have the bartender up higher, as if anointed as a holy one, at the alter of drink. Here they are exactly at the same level as you, and you feel like if you don't have their attention you could lean over and poke them at any time!The drink that I settle on is the San Luis Cup, which is spicy, with huge chunks of ice and cucumbers. I have never been steered wrong by a drink with cucumbers in it. This one was superb. Perfect in every way, from the conversation it births, to the eye-popping hips that it seemed to unleash in the room. I try to stay focused. Conversation is key. Meanwhile the drinks chisel away at my head, working at me ever so slowly. After two we are clearly ready to go, but then the dude with the mustache returns, and offers us a coveted table. A table! Well we can't turn that down of course, so we follow like lemmings, ready to order more cocktails, and while away the night. Now we have a tiny table, we have a couple of glasses of water, and we're struggling with this button the wall. Pushing, punching, poking, nothing works. Then one of us spots the chain, and pulls. The light comes out, voila! Shortly thereafter a waitress arrives, and takes our order for another round.Eventually you reach a point in the evening where you're drunk texting the person you're on a date with. Although this is sexy, and romantic in it's own way, it also means you've both had enough, and it's time to go. We settle up, and stumble out onto the street, the spring night air blowing gently, and a short walk to union square in front of us.",9,0.9897
1259,8,9,5.0,"Tavern is really trying hard to make a name for themselves as the new kid on the block. It replaced the old Canzaciti Roadhouse. It seems that they are pushing specials and deals left and right. I know a handful of people, including myself (and a bunch of reviewers here by the looks of it), that ""won"" a free night of drinking just for signing up for the contest. Hey, no complaints there. You get to drink for free and friends get half off on their drinks. I'm subscribed to their mailing list and often see extra specials.I came the night before July 4th and not only informed the waitress of a 1/2 off burger deal I was emailed about but also received a text message saying 'show this text for a free domestic beer!' Yes, please. The waitress was a little confused with the onslaught of deals I was bringing up but I was not about to pass up on free booze. I suppose the lack of communication shows because the waitress was not informed about the deals but its a new place and things like that will get ironed out in time. She was very nice about it and asked management to make sure I wasn't making things up.Specials:Monday - $3 beers and well drinksTuesday - Free slider (they are all $10 usually) with purchase of any first beerWednesday - $3 on select beer and a $5 cali chicken sandwichThursday - $15 bucket of any 5 beers you chooseHappy hour is Monday through Friday 5 - 8pm. Any beer is $4.Saturdays this summer - sign up for free drinks and your friends get $4 beers from 10pm to midnight.Ladies night on July 14th - buy one get one free bottle of wine and 1/2 off specialty drinks from 8 pm to 4 am.These prices are amazing. I came here with a huge group Tuesday night, we sat in the back room (it can be reserved) and ordered a ton of beers, sliders, and burgers. Because of all the specials it came out to roughly $20 per person. Insane.The bar is huge so its great for accommodating large groups. They have awesome tap tables in the middle so you don't need to keep going to the bar to get beer. Looks like Tavern is trying to make a name for themselves and it's working.",14,0.9972
1260,22,22,5.0,"I can't be objective about this review, because Swine is my dream restaurant. They have a statue of Wolverine. There are no words.At first blush, Swine seems yet another restaurant simply opening to take advantage of a craze - in this case, the current obsession with meat driven menus. This particular menu reads like an amalgamation of a Texas state fair and Chelsea trendsetters: Potato Chip Nachos or Lardo? Swine Chop with crispy fingerlings or Foie Gras Torchon? As someone who's nearly exclusively carnivorous, I was excited, but having been disappointed by other, similar concepts, my skepticism tempered said excitement.To forgo the foreshadowing: believe the hype. This place is damn good.I ordered a ""Buck Up"" cocktail; rum infused (appreciably) with pink peppercorn, mixed with grapefruit and ginger, topped with soda. The ginger doesn't overwhelm all the other components, as it is often wont to do, and the grapefruit provides a necessary tartness to balance the inherent sweetness of the rum. It also serves as an excellent palate cleanser between bites of various small plates. M and I shared the ricotta stuffed zucchini blossoms, which unexpectedly came on a bed of heirloom tomatoes, whose juice was mixed with orange zest and sea salt, creating a wonderful brine for the excess ricotta that spilled from the blossoms. The combination of creaminess and acidity is a staple to cooking, and worked as well in this dish as any other, with the orange zest elevating it to something interesting and unique, as opposed to another caprese knockoff. For our mains, M ordered the roast chicken (as someone who does not eat red meat, there weren't many options) while I ordered the bone marrow and brisket burger.I try not to use superlatives in reviews, as they're frequently unwarranted, but this was one of the best burgers I've eaten in the city. I was a little worried that the brisket was going to make the ensuing burger a little tougher than normal, but my fears were assuaged after my first bite. The light egginess of the bun, the sweetness of the caramelized onions, the funk of the gruyere, and the salty, tender, savoriness of the meat all went together as perfectly as they can in a burger. The crust stood up to the substantial juiciness of the ground beef, the brisket added a rich smokiness, and the bone marrow added an even richer, more intense meatiness. The fact that it came with a side of perfectly crisped potato wedges and was only $18 makes this one of the top five burgers in New York, hands down. The roast chicken was perfectly acceptable, but after that knockout of a burger, I couldn't care less. Sorry, chicken.We finished the night with their only dessert; a bacon hot fudge sundae. I don't typically like meaty desserts, and if you're like me, you likely won't enjoy this sundae: it is preposterously bacon-y. That said, it's my fault for ordering it, knowing full well my own preferences. In truth, I only ordered it in the hopes that as M and I lingered, the old couple who were blocking the amazing Wolverine statue would leave, so I could take a picture. When they didn't, I just asked if they would move, and took a picture around them. Block my Wolverine, eh? Give it up bub. Also, to the waitress who confirmed to M that it was indeed Wolverine, you are the (wo)man.With the sheer volume of interesting small plates, the well-executed entrees, and affordable yet enticing beer selection, I'm going to be back sooner rather than later. If you want to catch Swine flu before the hipsters do, I'd suggest you visit soon as well.",24,0.9971
1261,19,12,5.0,"Audio-video, done well in a living or working space, is indistinguishable from magic. And I haven't seen a better magician than Ali aka AJ at Matrix.When you have a relatively small budget (think Canton, not Krell), it is especially challenging to design an AV setup that delivers quality. But Matrix and AJ are great with finding creative solutions for your dollar-constrained cravings. AJ excels in the usual services -- installing TVs, surround sound systems and speakers. But he is also an expert in lighting controls and motorized shades--expensive upgrades that can only be part of my five-year plan. Matrix sources component parts at a competitive price, and charges installation fees by the hour. I found AJ and his team to be fast, accurate and punctual.I am very impressed with Matrix's commitment to doing it right. For example, my Sonos installation seemingly impacted the Internet speed in my apartment. AJ braved the heat to make a visit over a weekend afternoon, and quickly diagnosed the problem, isolating it to the wireless controls of the surround sound system -- a fairly non-trivial exercise.If you are in the market for audio-video services, give Matrix a call, and get those front row seats to a magician's show as you watch AJ at work!",19,0.9576
1262,17,12,5.0,"Per Se is exquisite. One does not come here for a meal, one comes for an experience. My husband and I enjoyed what's now become fondly known as ""the best meal of our lives"" here a few weeks ago. Food, wine, service, ambiance... these qualities harmoniously weave themselves into an exceptional combination at Per Se. . : Service : .Impeccable. The waiters struck the perfect balance of considerate but not intrusive, friendly but not unprofessional, knowledgeable but not pretentious. The waiters observed our eating patterns so perfectly, we never needed to ask for a single thing. They left a pitcher of water on our table, but considerately refilled each of our glasses in such a stealthy manner, it was as if the glasses were magically filling themselves. The servers brought and removed each dish with perfect timing, never leaving the plates too long yet also never making us feel rushed. As we later learned on the kitchen tour, they track each guest's dining tempo to ensure this immaculate serve.At the end of the evening, the staff gave us an interesting booklet about their purveyors as well as copies of our menu (printed with a personalized congratulatory message at the top). A nice touch as I suspect most people coming to Per Se are celebrating something. Or perhaps the upper echelons of society receive a ""Welcome back for your Tuesday dinner!"" message!?. : Ambiance : .The restaurant was smaller than I expected. It has an elegant feel to it with a nice, top view of Columbus Circle and Central Park greenery. We arrived at 5:30 pm for dinner (ending around 9:00 pm), great timing to experience sunlight, dusk and evening twinkles. Fresh flowers abounded throughout the restaurant. . : Food : . We thoroughly enjoyed our tasting menu and all the delicious intermezzos. Highlights included:- ""Oysters and Pearls"" - Famed oysters and caviar dish, rich and flavorful.- Egg custard with black truffle oil - Alternate to the ""oysters and pearls"" due to dietary restrictions. This was divine! Warm and rich, served in a delicate yet surprisingly strong eggshell. Very decadent and delicious.- Marinated Sungold Tomatoes - Served in earl grey tea ""vierge"" which was light and offered the perfect amount of sweetness, young almonds, thinly sliced cucumbers. Extremely refreshing. Tomatoes grown in the French Laundry garden. - Sauteed Fillet of Atlantic Striped Bass - Served with peas, sweet peppers, sprinkled with saffron. Perfectly sauteed with a slightly crispy edge. Best fish I've had in a very long time.- Butter Poached Nova Scotia Lobster - This is the point in the meal at which things seemed UNREAL, it was so good.- Herb Roasted Squab - Served with young leeks, risotto and surprisingly good roasted grapes served warm.- ""Calotte de Boeuf"" - Served with asparagus, ""pommes maxims"" (a potato garnish) and ""bernaise mousselin"" (bernaise sauce with cream). Rich, decadent meat.- Homemade Bread and Butter - Sounds simple, and it was.... but done excellently. Loved the homemade butter, both salted (fleur de sel) and unsalted. Enjoyed reading about ""Animal Farm"" in the purveyors booklet. Their sole product is butter for Per Se / French Laundry. . : Dessert : .Yes, it deserves its own category because it's AMAZING. Often my favorite part of a meal, dessert proved no exception at Per Se. Several dessert courses including ""Popcorn-Cola"", the pastry chef's interpretation of a first date made of the things found at the movie theater. Popcorn flavored sherbet over popcorn, raisins soaked in cola, cola syrup, brownie-type cake, and these amazing puffs of something (??) that had a fantastic consistency similar to fizz on the top of soda. Very creative. Our two dessert courses were followed up by a huge array of desserts at the end of the meal. First, a waiter came with a huge box of chocolates with three rows -- dark, milk and white. Each chocolate is uniquely flavored and the ""presenter"" explains every single one... then endures questions like ""what was that one again? and that one?"" before serving. Next, ""coffee and donuts"" (frozen espressos served alongside cinnamon sugar donuts) are served as well as bon bons, cocoa nibs and a tray with three tiers of macarons, truffles, and other chocolate goodies. Lastly, small drawstring bags of candies are presented to take home.Overall, Per Se did not disappoint. It was indeed astronomically priced and quite possibly a once-in-a-lifetime meal, but one I will never forget nor regret.",22,0.9996
1263,6,3,5.0,"**So excited** that this place has opened. You have to go down a narrow flight of stairs to enter, but the space itself is long and has good seating. Decor is adorable, and the two servers behind the counter were extremely helpful and care about the drinks. We discussed ice brewed vs. cold brewed coffee--they serve ice brewed to keep some of the flavor, which they care about because they serve Counter Culture! Obviously they're looking to make a quality place, which my neighborhood dearly needs.They offer light desserts and FYI, have a $5 credit card minimum.

1264,5,6,5.0,"Value is probably not the first thing that comes to mind on a 4-$ restaurant but in the realm of omakase, Jewel Bako is a steal. The omakase starts at $65 - far less than the $100+ most other places charge. $65 will get you a 10-12 course tasting of a variety of creatively designed sashimi, uni, unagi, and other treats - all of which are flown in fresh every day. Some notable creations: Tazmanian King Salmon with a smoked soy sauce, shiroebi (baby white shrimp), Spanish Mackerel, and of course, lightly seared o-toro. Any reputable omakase will serve the freshest available catch but what really sets an omakase apart is its creativity in preparation, taste combinations, and presentation. Jewel Bako doesn't serve the ""best"" omakase I've ever had, but at $65 it is unbeatable in value.A few quick tips:1. Omakase is served at the sushi bar so be sure to specify when you reserve2. Show interest and ask the head chef about what's being served - he'll often serve up special/extra pieces based on your tastes.3. Pair up your omakase with a bottle of Coedo Beniaka - a dark lager fermented with sweet potato. Absolutely delicious, unique and tastes like liquid candied yams.",14,0.9891

The land of rice crepes called ""dosas."" crunchy, delicious, and fillings that are unique and unimaginable. You fill your dosas with potatoes, onions, chillies and as I recently discovered, chicken too. these delicacies are served with lentil soup called ""sambhar"" and mango or coconut chutney. A perfect meal of protein, carbohydrates and some fat too!Stepping into the Indian Creperie on Mac Dougal street took me back home to India. Indian music, small but cute seating and a pleasant smiling waitstaff.

1266,10,8,5.0,"I just cannot say enough good things about M&M Pest Control. Tim, Herbie, and everyone else at the company are generous, honest, reliable, and professional. Here's the story.A few weeks ago, my fiancé and I had an overnight guest who woke up with mysterious red spots on her face. We've all been thoroughly traumatized by the constant fear of bed bugs, so we immediately freaked out and called the first bed bug inspection company we looked up. It was not M&M. That was a big mistake.The first company sent over a dog and handler to do an ""inspection,"" and the whole experience was terrible and unprofessional. The handler stomped all over our furniture and bedding in her shoes, seemed hostile and distracted the entire time, and answered every single one of our questions with, ""I don't know. You'll have to call the office."" She didn't even do a visual inspection; instead, she let her dog do all the work.Simply put: it did not inspire confidence. Enter Tim Wong, the director of M&M Pest Control and my freaking hero. I had actually talked to Tim once before, about eight months earlier, when David found a shiny spider beetle in our shower and we freaked out (of course). But Tim looked at a photo, reassured us that it was not, in fact, a bed bug and we moved on with our lives.Apparently, right after my friend woke up with those red spots, I had left a message on Tim's phone during my initial meltdown and promptly forgot about it. So it came as a surprise when my phone rang and it was Tim on the other end of the line. ""What's going on?"" he asked, calmly.I told him about everything -- including our terrible experience with the other inspectors -- and he confidently told me that he could help. A few days later, Herbie (another M&M employee) showed up with another bug-sniffing dog, Dexter.The two inspection experiences were night-and-day different. Herbie was professional, well-informed, and respectful of our apartment. While Dexter sniffed around, Herbie took almost ninety minutes to do a painstaking visual inspection of every corner of our apartment. He answered all of my questions in detail, confirmed that we do not (thank God) have a bed bug infestation, and suggested some possible alternate explanations for what happened to my friend's face. Before he left, he gave me a packet of information about how we can protect our apartment in the future.Tim and Herbie are more than just professional -- they are generous. Bed bugs are scary, and there are a lot of companies out there that take advantage of people's fear and panic. I know we got screwed by the first company, so I am so grateful to Tim and Herbie for swooping in to save the day. Thank you, thank you, thank you.Trust me, if you're having a pest problem, make M&M your first (and only) call. I'm very glad we don't have bed bugs after all, but if we did, I know we'd be in good hands with them.",15,-0.3875
1267,5,4,5.0,"Hands down my favorite burger spot ever!!When my boyfriend and I first came here we were lost. We entered the hotel through the bar, which was very classy and made us feel very underdressed =\. We sat in the lobby for a while, just looking around and trying to figure out where this place was. Finally the neon burger sign caught my eye and I followed the light ...We stepped in, and felt properly dressed once again. The place had such a chill and laid back feel to it. Ordering can be a bit intimating at first, a guest that we brought here said it reminded him of ""the soup nazi"", but it gets easy and it makes for the line to move faster. The menu is very simple and has an average amount of seating. The employees aren't very nice, but it doesn't really bother me for some reason -- since it isn't anything personal.I would recommend this burger to anyone. Try it!

1268,10,11,5.0,"I watched food porn's newest heavy hitter a couple of weeks back - the sumptuous 'Jiro Dreams of Sushi' - and have been salivating voraciously over oft-revisited, brain-branded imagery of high-resolution nigiri, glistening with vinegar sheen ever since. So, I was primed for Azabu (which, stuffed under the Greenwich Grill on a desolate stretch of a Holland Tunnel offshoot, was so geographically obscure that it MIGHT AS WELL have been Tokyo), and its pretty-penny price point. (One unit of o-toro nigiri costs $11, which cost about the same as my cab ride back to Brooklyn.)But. I do not think my recent romantic fantasies of sushi lent Azabu any undue credit. The nigiri was delicious. Mackerel, tuna (I had both said o-toro and akami) and uni were mouth-wateringly perfect; the amberjack was a very pleasant surprise. The sushi rice was excellent. Azabu might not be in the same league as Jiro, but it's absolutely sufficient to hold me over until I can foot a substantially more dramatic food pilgrimage. The details were immaterial, but here they are anyway: the service was a little annoying (leave me and my fish in PEACE, woman!), the aged sushi chef spaketh not a word of English, oscillating Japanese bidet (weirdly situated upstairs, in the Grill).",14,0.9551

Its pretty reasonable, 30 dollars each for the show.The place was incredible. tall floor to ceiling windows looking over Central Park and the skyline of NewYork City. It was so beautiful.

1270,12,11,5.0,"I came to Dobbs Dawg House with a dream and left with one too. Dream upon entering DDH: DDH will offer me the best hotdog everDream upon leaving DDH: Come back to DDH everyday for the rest of my lifeYelper Ben Y. and I came here twice in two days. That's a record for me because I never do that because I feel as though there are so many other places to try. But Dobbs Dawg House makes me never want to try anything ever again ever and I mean that in the best way.Ben was at DDH a few days prior to taking me and experienced the Mac Attack: warm macaroni and cheese topped with bacon bits on a hotdog. After hearing about this, I had to go.I ordered a Mac Attack and a Chili-n-Cheese hotdog. The Mac Attack was PURE PERFECTION, better than I imagined it to be, and tasted unbelievable. To further illustrate how perfect the Mac Attack is, Ben Y. ordered two both times we went.The chili and cheese dog was also perfect with its homemade chili and melted cheddar cheese. The hotdogs themselves are really great and served on a fluffy potato bun, which is always the best way to go. During my second experience at DDH, I highly considered getting the hotdog that features a fried egg and cheese, but I really couldn't get over how amazing the Mac Attack and chili and cheese dogs were and had to order those again. The guy who seems to be the owner and is also the chef is incredible friendly. When you walk in, there is someone who takes your order. It was a different guy for both of my experiences, but both were equally friendly and made us feel really welcome. After I said my order, my hotdogs were sitting on the counter before I could even open my wallet to pay. During both experiences, the chef brought us free things while we were sitting and eating our hotdogs! The first time he gave us homemade blondie-brownies and the second time he served us a ""dessert dog."" The dessert dog consists of a hotdog, peanut butter, chocolate sauce, peanuts and sliced bananas. While it sounds odd, the dessert dog is actually delicious. We were given free things and treated so well by the staff, which is something you don't see much anymore. The selection of hotdogs to choose from is awesome. The hotdogs are so unique and all sound so good, it's nearly impossible to choose just one or two for your meal. It's not everyday that everything on the menu is something I very badly want to have, but I will say that every hotdog and side dish at DDH is something I would eat. The side dishes are awesome. Macaroni and cheese, chili, coleslaw (really good, awesome purple color), and tater tots, to name just a few, are featured on the menu alongside the large variety of awesome, uniquely delicious hotdogs. Fresh cupcakes and other desserts are available at the counter. DDH has amazing branding for a non-franchise place opened by a guy who really loves what he does. They have an awesome logo featuring a growling dog, which they also feature on decals. When Ben asked how we could acquire the decals, the owner asked us what color we wanted and gave them to us! Dobbs Dawg House seems like the kind of place opened by someone who always wanted to have his own restaurant like this. The people who work there are fun and passionate about what they do, and their friendliness, service and delicious food put big smiles on every face that comes through the door.",13,0.9992

1272,9,3,5.0,"I've been meaning to write this review for a while and somehow I'm just getting around to it. I've been massaged once by King and twice by Chris, most recently this past Friday, so I think I have a pretty good grasp of their work.First off, I'm not a massage therapist but I'm probably a better judge of a massage than the average person. My grandfather is a massage therapist and he started giving me table massage when I was five years old. I've had professional massages all over the world: five star spas in Hawaii, private homes in Texas, outdoor spas in Thailand, cheapo Chinese joints in NYC, etc. I've had a ton of great massages and a ton of shitty massages.I'm a very active guy; I rock climb or workout in the gym 5-6 days a week. I also work in a hazardous field in which even a slow day can screw up my back. When I develop a persistent problem with my back or neck I always turn to a massage therapist to correct the issue before seeing a doctor; so I expect quite a bit from a massage therapist.Chris and King are exactly what I need. They both excel at their craft and go above and beyond most massage therapists. I've never had a massage therapist sit down with me after my massage to talk about my problem areas and give me advice on what I am doing to cause the problems and how to correct them. That alone is worth the price of the massage. Speaking of the price, it's perfectly reasonable. Yea you can get cheaper massages all over the city but you're not going to find this quality of work for any less.I think it might be time to start buying packages and doing a little preventative maintenance on my back.",27,0.9357
1273,21,9,5.0,"I rolled my eyes when I heard about the Chobani bar. I assumed it was going to be overpriced and just a waste of space. I was wrong. The ""priciest"" one is at $3.75 and just a plain yogurt is $2.75. And they are all served in a glass bowl...that you can later return for 25 cents off of your next yogurt visit. I got the plain Chobani and cucumbers...which also has mint, salt, olive oil, served with pita chips. It was absolutely delightful. The mint was the best part. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a Chobani employee carrying an iPhone ready to jot down my order. I gave her my name and she suggested some of her favorites. Each employee takes care of their own customer's orders (commission and whatnot, I believe). They couldn't take tips. While you wait for your yogurt(s) to be made, you can go over at the bar and watch the people make it. There are no seating areas, so it's all to go. The bar looked like a showroom for kitchens.

1274,6,6,5.0,"Excellent meal with the Bloomspot pre fixe menu! My bf bought a deal for $78 and we left very satisfied and full.. feeling like we got to sample BondSt's best dishes. Our rez was for Sat at 7:30- they didn't have anything after until 10:30. When we arrived, it was pretty quiet but started bustling at 8pm. The space is really beautiful (except the bathroom is very small) but note that with this deal, you can only eat in the lounge (which is a separate space- downstairs). If you can, try to eat at the bar because honestly the lounge tables are so low, you need to hunch down. The seats are nice plum benches with pillow...everything looks Japanese zen. We took a peak at the restaurant- the space above, which looked also very sleek, trendy with flowery decor. On the service: our waitress was so sweet, polite, and refilled our waters on time. She was not stingy about the deal at all and kept saying it was a sampling of the best dishes. She gave good recommendations as well and paced our meal nicely. Of course, every dish had the most beautiful presentation.We had: 1. 2 cocktails- $14-15 each. I had the St Germaine- which was very good. I love Shochu because it's not strong.. I get pretty drunk off it. Otherwise, there was a hint of lemon, and elderflower..not sure what that tastes like but it was very sweet. My bf got The Maurice, which he said he didn't like. I liked it- it had a very rice-y aftertaste and wasn't as easy to go down as the St Germaine because it was less sweet. Other suggestions our waitress made was the lychee martini and the dry saketini. 2. The tuna tarts- AWESOME. my favorite dish!! It was so buttery because it was thin slices of delicious fleshy tuna soaked in truffles and butter...with some kind of green leaf atop (cloves?)..on a crispy thin rice cracker.. cut into two small pizzas. So yummy. 3. The red snapper tacos- I loved how crispy the taco shells were; very freshly fried. The snapper was soft and flaky..and the guac and lime were great accompanists. I would say that this was probably my least favorite dish- though excellent- the flavors weren't as complex (I've had this kind of fish taco before) 4. The sea bass skewer- 2nd favorite. AMAZING! I'm glad we got to try this because people like the sea bass at BondSt. It was perfectly charred on the outside without being overcooked- and the bass was so buttery, with a yummy sweet sauce. The mung bean salad that came with it was also great- crispy with a touch of salt. 5. Main dish: 2 rolls of sushi, and 4 sashimi. The menu gave us a great taste of BondSt's sushi and apps. Our rolls were spicy tuna and shrimp tempura. I didn't love the shrimp tempura but then again i am a sushi purist and think anything sushi tempura was made for fake sushi fans. The shrimp was very breaded and fried- differently from the typical panko batter. It was so fried it sort of drown the flavor. The spicy mayo that came with this roll had a curry accent. The second roll was excellent- spicy tuna. I could tell the tuna was very rich..pretty sure it might have been the toro (belly). I especially loved the RICE- it was packed with flavor; with black sesame, which was great! The sashimi- was very fresh, but not the freshest. It was firm and had good texture- not too goopy (hate sashimi that's goopy and cold.. meaning it was frozen). We had 2 slices of: big eye tuna, salmon and yellowtail. Yellowtail was my favorite- but it usually is; very clean. 6. Dessert- chocolate meltdown which was a molten lava cake. Very delicious but my all time fav molten cake is that of JeanGeroge's. The outside layers were on the drier side (not bad just fyi) but the middle was very melty. It came with espresso ice cream, which had a strong flavor and had a bottom cookie crunch. They were no pressure to upsell anything; we paid 20% tip for excellent service on our pre discounted amount. Def. get this deal if you see it- it's a steal! Deal or no deal, I'd come back when I want some yummy Japanese... this place is kind of like EN (equally amazing) but a bit trendier.",13,0.9997
1275,7,5,5.0,"""Stretched-Out Medium""XL has yet to disappoint my friends and I. HK and Chelsea can't rely on the Ritz and Splash alone for our dancing needs. I mean remember the days of The Roxy, Spirit and Limelight...to name a few. You eventually developed your favourite spot. Crowd is very mixed and gaggles of like minded gays tend to cling in certain areas of the dance floor. The main dance floor appeals to the more remix/dance/electronic music whereas the other side is much more pop. Need I mention the stellar sound and lighting system. (Saturday is one of the best nights for music)I finally attended their '20 something' party and had a blast. It wasn't that crowded for a holiday but the people there were cute and fun. Coat check line always moves pretty quick, or at least when the people waiting in line pay attention when the attendant says ""Next"". Contrary to other reviews I have never paid $6 for coat check, so I don't know what that's about. Besides...soon you won't even be needing it. The bartenders are always amicable and observant. The promoters and door guys definitely remember a face. The outside smoking area is convenient and well planned. I have rarely waited for the bathrooms here and if there is a line it moves fast. Tip your attendant!Oh and if you don't have an XL membership card, you're silly. It's complimentary and grants you discounts on any door cover and drinks!!",11,0.9864
1276,7,5,5.0,"Upper East Side, mourn the loss of Francois Payard no more (you can go to the Plaza Food Hall or Columbus Circle if you must). Eric Kayser est arrive. The Maison Kayser on Third Avenue is a boulangerie (bakery) and patisserie (pastry shop), with a coffee bar and sit-down restaurant. I tried the shop when I stopped by on opening day, I did not stay for the restaurant. Staff were friendly but in the weeds, but that's completely expected for the first day. Heck, a work crew was still screwing light fixtures to the facade! But who cares, they could be spraying a nail gun around the room, nothing was going to get between me and Parisian baked goods!The croissant was light and flaky, characterizations that are almost cliche with croissants, but worth noting for this one - it was especially light and especially flaky. My favorite croissant in the neighborhood remains that of Cafe D'Alsace, but the Kayser croissant was terrific - as good as Ceci Cela, if not better.The pain au raisin was not as sweet as I expected, but was otherwise so good that I feel like other pain au raisin examples do not measure up to the Kayser.The manager convinced me (it did not take much) to get the pistachio cookie, and boy I'm glad she did. Crisp, with plenty of pistachios and tons of flavor. Perfect.There were bowls of little financiers for sampling - they were good enough that I ended up with a bag of them to go. I'm not sure how that happened, they were in with the other goodies when I got home - caught up in the frenzy of bakery acquisitions, I suppose.Iced coffee from the coffee bar is delicious, though I think I spotted a shot of espresso thrown in - cheating perhaps, tasty certainly. The price was right, so no complaints. I do not know if the iced coffee is cold-brewed - in a baked-goods delirium, I did not think to ask.Now, as for the baguette? Waiting for later!Speaking of later, they will see me again for sure!",12,0.9816
1277,11,5,5.0,"This review is for Bettibar:After we went to B. Smith's for his birthday dinner, my boyfriend told me he wanted to take me to a speakeasy across the street. I wasn't sure what to expect and was surprised that there would be such a place on Restaurant Row, but sure enough, an older man sitting outside told us to walk up a flight of stairs which led us to our destination.It was dimly lit and felt somewhat clandestine despite the fact that the chances of the place getting raided by the police are pretty slim in this day and age. The happy hour special of a beer in a brown bag and a shot cracked me up, and I love how committed Bettibar is to its theme. The atmosphere was very sexy and I loved it. The other patrons seemed to be theater people but being there, I forgot that I was mere feet away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square. Bettibar is a gem and I hope to be back soon.",10,0.9904
1278,8,2,5.0,"On an otherwise quaint, quiet residential block, we at first walk right past it - the exterior is so unassuming that it's easy to miss. Once inside, once we've adjusted to the hushed dimness of this velvet and maroon lounge, it's only a few short moments until we've found a table. You can tell it's a Saturday night but at the same time it's not too crowded, not too loud. She speaks into my ear and I hear her. The music permeates rather than irritates - I almost lose myself to the soundtrack of my youth (when we don't even care, as restless as we are), but am instead struck by the soft light reflected in the depths of her eyes. Leaning towards her, I ask, do you want something to drink? White Russian, she says. It doesn't take long to get the bartender's attention. He's good: efficient, proficient. The price is Upper East Side but ok even for an indebted grad student like myself. We linger only for a little while on this particular evening but the mood induced by a few drinks matched with the perfect ambience means this memorable spring night is not over. We should have come here more often.Seriously though, this place is awesome!",9,0.9098

1280,12,7,5.0,"Club A Steakhouse attracted us with a Three-Course Steak Dinner for Two on a Living Social deal for $75 (no wine included). The best thing about the deal was that we can use for more than 4 people in one sitting (not usually available with other deal offers). This was perfect for our birthday celebration for my BFF with a party of 8. The only restriction for a Saturday reservation was that we must be dine between 5 - 6:30pm or after 9pm. It worked out perfectly. The waiters were very cordial and respectful. They worked together as a team to provide excellent service. We can call anyone of them and get results immediately. We were very happy with the wine list and selections. I would say handreds of bottles that you can choose from and from different regions. Superb!The meal was scrupulously delicious. For appetizer, we ordered Canadian Bacon, Steak Tartare, Caesar Salads. For entree, we ordered Filet Mignon, Trout, Veal, Hanger steak, Salmon. For side dishes, we ordered Creamed Spinach, Mac and Cheese, Mash Potatoes. Of course, I took a bite from everyone/s dish (The chinese way). For dessert, there were only 2 choices, Tiramisu and Creme Puffs. Yummy!-----------------------------------------------An immediate follow-up to Club A Steakhouse yelp review and I changed my 4 star to a 5 star rating!

1281,11,9,5.0,"This place looks good, in a traditional Italian way; beautiful but not fancy. Many interesting details to study in every nook and corner. Apparently it's authentically Sicilian; I can't vouch for that, though it feels like many trattorie I've been to in other parts of Italy. It just opened a week ago and still kinda has that new-restaurant smell. Many servers, some still learning the ropes, were roaming the place, giving lots of attention. There were a few moments of confusion, but their friendliness made up for it. I guess their old-fashioned black and white outfits with caps are meant to be a traditional touch, though the managers (?) are in modern Italian suits. Bread was served with authentic Sicilian olive oil, both of high quality. A fresh sardine appetizer ($18) was sublime, butterflied and pan-fried and indeed fresh tasting, and served with a nice salad tossed with fennel and orange segments. I can be kinda squeamish about fishiness, and this didn't have any, though it did have tiny bones that crunched right up easily . The grilled vegetable app ($12) was also good, though nothing show-stopping (ordered this to try and please newly vegetarian child). We tried the pappardelle with pistachio cream, potatoes and green beans ($18), and it was SO comforting. It was really about the perfectly silky fresh noodles and the light, nutty cream sauce. A few al dente chunks of potato and a scattering of bright green beans looked nice in the toss. Also tried the angel hair with sea urchin and bottarga (tuna roe) ($20). I didn't notice the bottarga, but the uni was as light as egg custard, mixing in beautifully with the spicy pasta. We got the $20 Sicilian rosé and it went well with all the dishes and didn't give heartburn to the wallet.Oh yeah, daughter got the pizza with cherry tomatoes ($15). A small was HUGE. Nice crust, kinda sweet from the tomatoes; she loved it.Since the pastas were so good, we decided to try a couple of desserts. That's where our bill (and our calories) really started adding up, but pretty much worth it.A tiramisu was classically perfect, fresh and light. And the tiny chocolate cake with gooey center was spot-on, though I can't say it was Italian in any way. Both tasted like they were made very recently. I think they were each $10 and a thimble of espresso (literally two sips) was $4.25; authentic in size but not in price. Other miscellaneous observations:Really nice blue-tiled bathrooms. The over-sized white couch in the front would be great for lounging with a Prosecco or some snacks, but I have a feeling it might get replaced with dining tables if this restaurant is successful. Wall projections of Sicily maps and scenes and a sunset constantly being broadcast on a flatscreen TV are corny, but the rest of the decor kinda makes up for it.",16,0.999

1283,15,9,5.0,"If I lived in a perfect world, Anita Lo would be that aunt of mine who always cooks a table-full during the holidays. Hey, we're both Chinese... a girl can dream! Even though this world isn't quite perfect, I'm happy to be able to come to Annisa and experience Chef Anita Lo's cooking firsthand.The boy brought me here to celebrate our anniversary, and I really couldn't have been more blown away by his surprise and the meal. Every single dish that came out of the kitchen (and under Chef Lo's watchful guard) was absolutely delightful and full of fantastic flavors. | Seared foie gras with soup dumplings |: it's certainly not hard to see why this appetizer would be one of the most popular offerings here. The tender dumplings full of powerful porky broth and just a hint of rich foie and duck fat was a total explosion of flavors in my mouth. The jicama, a root vegetable I love, played well in complementing the richness of the dumpling filling and added some expected contrast (perhaps like how water chestnuts usually would?). The foie gras was luxurious and buttery as it should be, and I really enjoyed the depth in flavor it picked up from the quick sear.| Broiled Spanish mackerel with garlic fried milk, satsumaimo & Korean chili |: the perfect homage to Korean home-cooking, but much more updated and sexy... Braised mackerel with gojujjang is one of my favorite dishes, but Chef Lo's interpretation really outdoes the traditional dish by adding texture with the nutty broiled skin, creaminess with the garlic fried milk and crunchy satsumaimo cubes. It's difficult to cook Spanish mackerel because it's such a oily and strong fish, but the fillets were so thin and broiled so perfectly that I practically wanted to lick my plate - the chili sauce included.| Grilled wagyu with escargots, garlic chives & alba mushrooms |: this was the bf's entree choice, so I can't comment on it too extensively. The wagyu was cooked to 'rare' as the chef suggested, and he really thought that 'rare' was the way to go. He loved the silky, butteriness of the beef, commenting that the fat was perfectly strewn out through the entire cut and in every morsel. I personally tried a piece of the escargot, which was perfectly cooked and certainly unexpected to be paired with beef - a play on ""surf & turf"" perhaps?And for dessert, we opted to share the Tower of caramelized banana and peanut butter with coconut sauce. The presentation of it, first off, was simple and beautiful. Reminiscent of a napoleon, this tower consisted of layers of whipped sweet peanut butter and a luscious cream, bruleed bananas, and some sort of nutty, thin crisp. The coconut sauce that was almost foam-like was classically Asian in flavor, and made the dish lighter. It shocked me how well coconut and peanut butter works together, I can't believe no one has thought of that sooner!This was certainly one of the most memorable dinners I've had in the city. Not just because it was a lovely anniversary surprise, but Chef Lo truly blew me away with her inventiveness and technique. It would be a crime to dub the food at Annisa as ""Asian fusion,"" but if there was ever a good way to fuse Asian flavors with French technique and market-driven ingredients, this is it.",14,0.9985
1284,5,10,5.0,"So there is deff hype around these lobstah rolls and its well deserved. It wasn't until The Great GoogaMooga that I had my first Luke's experience. Not only did I wait in a line of about 100 people but it was hot as hell that day too. Worth the wait? Absolutely. I was almost in tears when it ended. I knew I should have gotten a whole. #cheap.So with that being said, after the tasting, I needed Luke back in my life. STAT. I also seriously needed a foodie dinner date with my girl. Of course we went to the East Village location because that's the hood we love! We knew on a Friday we were taking our chance at this small little eatery which meant quite possibly not getting a seat. But we went in for the kill.Stroll in, glance at the menu, although I already knew ... then step right up and place your order! One lobstah roll with a pickle (of course) and one crab roll. Okay, so yah it's a little pricey but it's beyond worth it. Then the waiting game began for both food and seats. As soon as our food was out it just happened to be luck of the draw that two seats were about to open up! Seats snagged it was time to dig in. I had been craving this roll for quite some time. All conversation stopped since I had to chow down. Now I'm from New England, so I like to think I know good seafood. What I love about Luke's is the fact that they don't drown the lobster in mayo. It's just enough to give it some flavor but its not overpowering. The lobster is always fresh and meaty. I want to say it's claw meat but I'm not 100% on that. And nothing completes a New England lobstah roll like a big sour pickle and a bag of salt and vinegar chips ... Cape Cod chips at that! My friend decided to mix it up and go with the crab roll, which she was very pleased with. The other thing to note about these rolls is now they actually treat the roll. It's like this delicate little thing, lightly buttered and thrown on the griddle for a few seconds just to give it some color but also add a little bit of warmth the roll. I just have to ask one thing, what is better than good company and a delicious meal? If you've got something better for me, please enlighten m",8,0.9978

Nothing like smoking shell casings, packing your own ammo, and a hot cup of coffee to get your blood pumping!This had to be one of the most fun things I have done with my merry group of Yelp friends. What better way to celebrate a birthday (Julia B) than by shooting round after round of 22 caliber bullets at multiple targets?Feel the firepower!The West Side Rifle & Pistol Range is just an amazing place hidden away in the basement level of a building that is very normal looking on West 20th street. As you enter the actual facility it is like being exposed to another world. Everyone who works there is packing heat, including the tattoo'ed up older gentleman manning the main counter who would probably blow your head off with a wink of the eye. You constantly hear the pop pop pop of guns being fired. Pictures and posters of celebrities and important people who have been here line the walls. This is a world seemingly unknown to most.  Before coming here you need to have a background check ahead of time and if you are lucky enough to pass that then you are in! First time entrance fee is $65 and that covers a three month trial membership, 50 rounds of ammo, and a safety/training session with a certified shooting instructor. Our instructor, Raymond, was terrific. Not only was he very personable, but highly informative, patient, and funny too. He taught us all the basics of using a Ruger 22 caliber rifle - loading, unloading, stance, arming the magazines, how to hold the gun safely, etc. He is a pro and did not take this lightly, which is best for all. It had been a while since I had been out shooting and having this course as part of the package is a great idea. They are dead serious about safety here. I was surprised they let our marginally demented group actually hold weapons!Raymond then led us to one of the firing ranges. The range had seven stations, which was just right for our party, and some random dude that barged in on our birthday group. He told us there is always a spot open to shoot if we ever come back as I think there is more than one range. We had a blast! Each one of us was firing away at targets 25 and 50 feet away. You can get cocky and push the target far out to the back wall and see how good you are. We all did pretty well as shell casings bounced all around. I was surprisingly accurate considering I had not shot a rifle in years. Just remember to sweep up your area as casings are everywhere.I absolutely loved this place! I feel everyone should know how to handle a weapon safely, learn how to shoot, and it's also a great way to develop hand-eye coordination. Plus, it's a good stress reliever. The $65 three month membership means that you can return at any time without making an appointment, re-doing the background check, or having to sit through the safety class again. You pay just $35 a visit plus ammo rounds. You are issued a card with your name, date you first came, and a membership number. A year membership is very affordable at only $275. Plus, if you sign up within a week of your first visit they apply that $65 towards it, so the cost ends up being $210 for the year which includes unlimited shooting time and no range fees. This is a terrific deal!Of course, we all went out drinking after this! With my birthday coming up this might make for a great gift that I will surely use. Need to start dropping the hints! Looks like now I will be ready to kill many zombies, as watching all those episodes of The Walking Dead will not go to waste!",51,0.9961
1294,9,8,5.0,"This is where I sound off on the longstanding rivalry between Ippudo and Totto:Ippudo has good ramen, but is more style than substance. Totto is where you go to eat the best. Ippudo is where you take a group of out-of-towners, Totto is where you go to eat alone (or with one other). I love ramen, all kinds. I've tried Minca, Setagaya, Hide-chan, Momofoku Noodle Bar and Menkui-tei. I find that I prefer the smaller, more authentic-feeling joints like Minca and Totto. Cramped, intimate, where you can watch the chefs prepare your food--that's what I like. If you're not into that, that you'll probably have a more pleasant experience at Momofoku or Ippudo. The wait is a factor, of course. Don't be intimidated by the mobs of people outside, the line will move a lot faster than you think. I waited around 45 minutes on a Monday night during peak hour, but it wasn't terrible.As for the ramen at Totto, the broth is what sealed the deal. It's so rich and flavorful but not too salty (I'm looking at you, Minca). The noodles are also a perfect, firm texture. Proportions are just right, smaller than Minca but larger than Ippudo. Worth the trek and worth the wait if you're craving top-notch ramen.",16,0.993

Until 5am to be exact.The inside is small with only one table for two. The only lighting was by two dimly lit lights and the light above the pizza. It was just enough light to notice the pizza slicer decorated ceiling. Margarita pizza had just came out of the oven. It looked gorgeous. It tasted perfect. It was exactly what I had been craving. Great crust, tomatoey fresh tomato sauce, the freshet basil softened from the oven just right and the mozzarella cheese and added parmesan cheese sprinkle was heavenly. $4 a slice for pizza perfection.

No one interrupts you. 3. You have festivals!4. Ice Skating? Yes, please! I love to unleash my inner Baiul!On any given day, you can just relax and enjoy some lunch or a great book. They have clean tree-lined paths that lead the way. I love the fact the wonderful restaurants and bar are perfect for post-Broadway, but that's another review. I hit up the ad for free knitting classes on Thursdays and had a great time. Last year they had free knitting lessons on Thursdays - they even supplied the yarn and needles. I can now knit a sweater - if you are irregular, have a large neck, and your right arm is longer than your left.Also, did I mention - MOVIES IN THE PARK! Yeah, that J.Lo/Matt McConaughey scene in The Wedding Planner isn't made up. They show them on the lawn and have service courtesy of 'Wichcraft. I love this place.

1297,14,17,5.0,"My first experience with La Maison was receiving a variety of tiny chocolates in an ornately wrapped box as part of a larger care package. I didn't think much of it at the time (the brand, not the chocolate. The chocolate was amazing.) but when I first moved to NY, the harpies in my office would not shut up about macarons. Cough, I mean they (lovely women, all of them) insisted that I had to try macarons from these five places and tell them which was best. Now, as someone who makes his own macarons on occasion(say something emasculating, I dare you), I really didn't understand the hub-bub. Then I went on this (ig)noble macaron quest. Let's just say there's a reason I don't make macarons professionally. (That reason is it doesn't pay enough. Zing! But seriously, they are a massive pain in the ass to get right.)I saved La Maison for last, and it didn't disappoint. While it wasn't my favorite, it was a close call. The chocolate filling is an interesting (and understandable) twist, but it does sometimes mask the base flavors of the macaron. That said, you don't come here solely for macarons. I mean, you could, but that would make you a massive pillock. The hot chocolate varieties are fantastic, as is really any form of the chocolate itself. I don't think there's anything here that you shouldn't try at least once. Obviously a lot of it depends on what you're looking to get out of a chocolate, but trust me when I tell you they have pretty much anything for you. Unless you're a weirdo, and want some flash in the pan fad flavor that is questionable to add to chocolate in the first place, like yuzu or something. In which case...shove off, weirdo.",14,0.9413
1298,12,16,5.0,"After all my cellphone adventures, I suddenly feel the urge for a banh mi sandwich. Not noodles, not pizza, nothing else will do.Being a New Yorker, I'm spoiled that way. I feel like whatever urge strikes me, I should be able to satisfy it at any moment 24 hours a day. Firing up Yelp on my brand spanking new iphone 4s takes about one gajillionth of a second, and there on my screen lies banh mi mecca, only one block north from my current fixie coordinates. How can this be. What god is smiling down on me today? Perhaps it's because my birthday is only a couple of weeks away, and I'm already bathing in the good luck vibes. Heading over, I lock up my ride, and stroll into the shop. It looks almost like a grocery store at first, unadorned, except by a teaming mass of people around the checkout register. On one side a guy is yelling out numbers of previously ordered sandwiches, and the other a lady takes orders. I ask for a banh mi buddhist, because well you know I'm bald and vegetarian so what the hell else would I order? She takes my ten and it disappears into some money pit in the basement, and five few well worn singles are returned to me. $5 that's it?!?! Cash only reads the sign on the register. I love chinatown! Shortly thereafter order number 69 comes up, and well the stars couldn't be any more aligned today as the sandwich that they hand over to me is well probably the most delicious banh mi i've ever had! Soft tofu, marinated shiitake mushrooms, basil, cucumbers, even the roll seems delightful. I chomp and chomp and chomp some more. The sunshine is streaming in from the front door beckoning me on with this great day, so I toss my garbage and head out the door with a big fat smile on my chubby cheeks!",12,0.9893
1299,5,3,5.0,"I am going to be as objective and informative as I can in my review with this studio, and just state the facts and also highlight important details for those who may be interested in practicing here and what they should prepare/expect. 1. Practice: What you should expect is true-to-script bikram yoga. The best instructors don't go off on a tangent or get wordy while we're holding poses. My instructor/class recommendations are those led by Upkar and Eddie, Kelly, and Jenna. The above teachers commit to correcting your form, especially if its your first time. 2. Studio: The floors are not carpeted but instead are of a plastic material in order to prevent stinky-ness. To be honest with you? it still smells like a bikram yoga studio, and you can either live with it or do with out. 3. Crowd: Expect it to get crowded (I'm talking mat-to-mat, elbow-to-elbow) and expect this to contribute to the extra hot-ness of the room. Therefore, be very well-hydrated before class and prepare to feel like you are going to die (yes, even for consistent practitioners). 4. Times: Peak times are usually 6 pm or 6:30 pm on weekdays and 11 a.m. on weekends. Be sure to arrive at least 30 minutes before class to check in at the front desk. I would recommend the 9 a.m class on Sunday morning (not as crowded) and the evening class on fridays where you'll see the least amount of crowds. Be ready to enter the studio 15 minutes prior to the start of class. 5. Locker Room Space: The locker room is small. Use whatever space you have to efficiently and expeditiously change in and out of your clothes. everyone is considerate of each other and orderly. The locker room has two hair dryers, q-tips, handsoap, small plastic bags for your wet clothes, and shower gel and shampoo are provided. 6. Waiting: The congestion in the lockerroom after class mixes with those getting ready for the next class, so it'll be a while till you can get your turn in the shower (I'd say 15 minutes after recess). 7. Swipe card: When you sign up for your membership, be sure to ask for a swipe card which you can link to your key chain. This will help you to sign in to class more expeditiously, and this helps control traffic at the front desk as well.*8. For those who've practiced at other studios in the city, you will be some what disturbed by the excess chatter before and after class in the studio and the somewhat lax attitude towards students running in and out in the middle of class to use the bathroom. The studio is managed very well despite it's high volume traffic and front desk staff is very friendly and welcoming. Fellow students are orderly and courteous and everyone is generally polite and in a good mood all the time. It's a positive atmosphere, and once you get used to the crowdedness and the chattiness in the studio and the locker rooms, you may start feeling really at home at Bikram Yoga Grand Central.",16,0.997
1300,20,19,5.0,"""Always do sober what you said you'd do drunk, that will teach you to keep your mouth shut"" - Hemingway I finally made it to Death & Co. With almost 600 reviews of this place it's hard to be original... however when you've finally struck gold and experienced the best place to find a cocktail in all of New York it's hard not to write about it. The scene was a busy Saturday evening, 8pm ish. We walked up and my man Sam outside the door told me there would be a 2 hour wait... no worries friends this is the East Village, home to plenty of establishments to get our drink on while we wait. We gave Sam our digits and moved on our way (see you're not even technically standing around waiting... so I see no need for complaints). Two hours later we checked back with Sam who told me it would be another half hour... it is worth the wait, be patient young grasshopper. At 10:37pm an unknown 718 number flashed across the screen and I screamed in delight! Finally, the moment had come. We walked in and, as others have noted, I was surprised at how small D&C was. The place is dark with black walls and candlelit tables. Two chandeliers hang in the front over the booths near the door. It's quiet, dark and sexy. We were seated in a booth near the back. This is not the type of place you come with the sole purpose of getting drunk, although that is a reasonable outcome. You come here to converse with friends, to sip well crafted cocktails, and witness the magic around you. The bartenders here are half artists, half mad scientist and all around simply exceptional. I must admit I've never been a whiskey girl. I like my wine and tend to pick something with bubbles, vodka or gin. At D&C not only did I not stray off the whiskey page, but I simply fell in love!! ""Rye whiskey, Rye whiskey, Rye whiskey I cry... if I don't get Rye whiskey, I surely will die""My first drink the Jackal and Hide was a delicious Bourbon beverage with one single large ice cube (love that) and an orange peal garnish. The next beverage came in a martini glass with Knappogue Irish single malt, the name escapes me... these cocktails will do that to you... but I really don't think you can go wrong with any selection at Death & Co.",21,0.8743
1301,25,27,5.0,"I got thrown out of PKNY last night, and I'm still giving them five stars. That should tell you something.My boyfriend and I wandered over here with a friend of ours last night. Despite the fact that it was 9:30 on a Saturday, it wasn't too crazy inside and we could immediately get a table. Nice!After we sat down, we realized that we had actually sampled of one of PKNY's cocktails before, at Yelp's Starr African Rum Challenge event at Hotel Chantelle. Although I didn't vote for PKNY's drink at that event, it won overall and was definitely delicious so obviously the bartenders at this place know what they're doing.On the waiter's suggestion, we ordered three drinks from their Top 10 list: The Missionary's Downfall (which was blended, minty, and delicious), The PK (which was coconut-y, pineapple-y, and creamy), and ... well, we've forgotten the name of the last drink. But it was served with one of those fun flaming limes on top! I am henceforth going to be underwhelmed by any cocktail presentation that doesn't involve fire.We drank enough of our cocktails to know that they were all super yummy, when ... dun dun DUHNNN ... a man came by and asked for our IDs. (We shall henceforth call him ""Mr. Just Doing His Job."") My boyfriend showed his ID. Our friend showed her ID. And aaaall the way up in the Upper West Side, my ID shed a single tear as she sat forlornly in my wallet, which was in my purse, which was in my apartment. ""You have to leave,"" said Mr. Just Doing His Job.""Can we finish our drinks first?"" I asked.""No,"" barked Mr. JDHJ. ""The police will come and arrest me."" (Which makes perfect sense because it's not like the NYPD really has anything better to do **eye roll** but who am I to argue?)So I shuffled over to our waiter. ""Um, hi,"" I mumbled. ""I know this definitely isn't your fault, and I totally should have brought my ID, but, um, since there was no one carding at the door, and we didn't finish our drinks, we kind of feel like ... we shouldn't have to pay for them.""(I mean, these drinks were like $16 a pop. $48 is a lot to spend on cocktails that we had like four sips of, you know?)To my surprise, he didn't miss a beat. ""Oh my gosh, of course! You don't need to pay for them,"" he said, smiling. ""Mr. JDHJ was a bit late tonight. Usually he's at the door. Sorry about that!""How rad is that? Totally friendly, considerate customer service. I thanked him and said that I would absolutely come back someday soon (with my ID proudly brandished like a battle sword).And I totally will.",19,0.9899
1302,21,19,5.0,"Heed my warning: Pegu Club may arouse your inner, erotic creature. (You): Go on...?Maybe it was the company. Maybe it was the music. Maybe it was the alcohol. Maybe it was the fact that we were surrounded by sexy women on the prowl.... and we started discussing our preferences and fetishes. Wait, wait, I'm getting off track here.Allow me to break Pegu down for you based on my experience: Do you ever have one of those cliché New York City fantasies where you meet some mysterious man (or woman) at a mysterious bar and the entire atmosphere literally makes the whole evening a tense session of mind-stimulating foreplay? (Which then leads to the obvious resulting scenario...) Ok, so I didn't exactly meet up with a mysterious stranger for my evening at Pegu, but that is exactly the feeling I got while I was there. As some of my guy friends might say, this place has the potential to seal the deal. It has that vibe. That lavish, teasing, sensual encompassing vibe that makes you feel like you're a super model incognito. To me, the decor just oozes sexy confidence and from surveying the room, I could tell it was rubbing off on people. I know it was rubbing off on me.So now that I've probably warmed you up a little bit, let's focus on the most important reason why people come to Pegu: the drinks. For myself, I started off with a La Fluer de Paradis at the bar counter. Our bartender has somewhat of a famous reputation for crafting delectable drinks according to your tastes and I was looking forward to trying what he chose for me. I was informed that my cocktail had been created using gin and La Germaine. Sweet like flowers, crisp, and strong without being bitingly so. I normally do not love gin based drinks but I found this to be a very pleasant surprise. Next at the suggestion of my alcoholic partner in crime for the evening, I chose the Earl Grey Martini. At this point we had scored a two person table on the far side that came with two plush chairs. Ah it felt so good to sit back, sip, and take in the scenery while engaging in inappropriate conversation with my compadre. The Earl Grey Martini is probably one of the more interesting drinks I've had in my lifetime. The top third of this drink is basically all foam and a small bit of orange peel. Just dive right in and slurp that head. You imagine it will taste like tea but it instead shocks you with a strong citrus flavor at first sip. The citrus flavor then transitions from sweet to the slight bitterness of Earl Grey and then to something more round and full in essence. I'm not quite sure what was all going on with my taste buds, but I liked it.By the way, I loved our waitress. She had a little Bettie Paige thing going on with her bangs and bold lipstick. Such a doll. She enthusiastically served our drinks the rest of the evening at our table. She basically cheered me on when I decided to step up my game and order two Old Fashioneds. Knock knock, I'm drunk! In hindsight, not the smartest decision I've made but it tasted so good and went down smoothly. I didn't gag at all like I normally do on whiskey! Impressive.The music definitely changed at one point to a beat I wanted to jump up and dance to (amongst other things). I remember being asked at one point why was I scratching the table slowly with my nails. I don't recall giving an answer and I'm sure as hell not going to give you one now. Watch out if you've been sitting down and have had 3-4 drinks as that first walk to the washroom to fix your lipstick can be quite a doozy. I can personally assure you, you are definitely getting your money's worth with your liquor.We decided to call it a night as my funds had run embarrassingly low and my friend was hungry for deliciously greasy noodles. Pegu ain't cheap but I bet you already knew that. While it wasn't really crowded when I entered around 8:30 on Friday night, the room had filled up immensely as we stumbled (and I do mean stumbled) out at 11.Pegu Club stands for the most part unmarked on the street, only betraying its presence with an emblem on its door that changes colors depending on the day. While not technically a speakeasy, there are no big signs or flashing neon lights to catch your eye. Sadly like some of the better things in life, it can be easily missed if you aren't looking for it. For those of us who know what we're looking for, we are lucky. With its incredible drinks, swanky decor and sexy aura, Pegu Club is surely an establishment you don't want to pass by.",20,0.9987
1303,12,7,5.0,"The birthday boy I brought here brought me back here for Christmas. And we agree there will also be a next time.The Masa experience is euphoric. Each dish, each bite, each taste is exhilarating. Chef Masa knows just how to get those endorphins flowing, and delights your taste buds just perfectly so the brain knows no law of diminishing marginal utility. The menu comprises fish, caviar, shellfish, and vegetables, with option to add meat and dessert. The optional courses can be shared. It's best to sit at the sushi bar, although there are tables in the dining room if you have a larger party. By the way, Masa eliminated the 20% non-gratuity service charge.The meal starts with hairy crab, followed by toro tartar and caviar. Then comes fugu, prepared both fresh and fried (equally scrumptious). After that comes langoustine (this may be the one course where you feel somewhat out of place, sucking and pulling with your bare hands in the middle of a zenlike sushi bar). Next comes wagyu beef with truffle (if you haven't had multiple foodgasms before this course, well.. this is honestly like tasting the essence of culinary perfection). Finally (before moving on to sushi, that is), you have the white yellowtail shabu shabu (FYI you may well be feeling intoxicated by this point, and not necessarily from the sake).Now we take a little breather... until the chef asks, ""Ready for sushi?"" It's a rhetorical question, of course. You're elated; you're enthralled; you will eat whatever you're served, which is good because the next hour or so entails eating right out of the chef's hands, one piece of delectable mouthwatering sushi at a time, until you've tried all 19 plus the roll. The experience at Masa doesn't end until you (and your tummy) determine it's over. So I tried to remember which pieces I wanted to ask for more of... another toro, another uni, aoyagi, sayori.... but after the last amazing piece, I realized it was a moot point. I had just completed one fabulous meal and I was perfectly satiated!",21,0.9916

It has such a comfortable romantic feel to it and the service is amazing. They have a lot of options, but as i mentioned earlier I am the special rolls type of gal and they've got a lot of those here. They are a bit pricey, averaging ~$12/roll, but it is worth every penny.I order delivery for lunch here often at work and even got some co-workers to eat different fishes/seafoods that they've never imagined themselves eating.

1305,12,7,5.0,"Everyday at around 11:45, the lines outside Num Pang haphazardly file east to 3rd. The secret is out and it took some hip, urban Cambodians to bring some excitement to Midtown East lunch. Of course, for those kids in the know (hipsters/NYU kids), Num Pang is nothing special and I applaud you for being ahead of the curve. Num Pang has been on my radar, but I just assumed it was another above average Asian sandwich shop. Unfortunately, we all know the old idiom on assumptions. ""When you assume, you make an ass out of you and me.""Num Pang is not simply above average, it is revolutionary in the world of Asian sandwiches. It's the cool kid every girl had a crush on in high school. The one that doesn't have to be obnoxious just to be funny. He just chills in the back, slouched in his chair. He doesn't walk through a crowded corridor, he glides through them. The guy you and every other guy knew had swag. And this brick and mortar between Lex and 3rd perfectly exudes that. You walk in at any given time and you can hear classic east coast rap like Nas and the Wu with workers rocking Jordans or Nikes.However, unlike that cool kid, where you just had no clue what made him so damn cool. I know Num Pang's secret. It's the MEATS. Take your standard Asian sandwich, i.e. the banh mi with vietnamese ham, terine, spam, and pork pate and throw it out the window. Replace it with your choice of Ginger BBQ Brisket, Five Spiced Glazed Pork Belly or Grilled Spanish Mackerel with Leek and you have on ""evolutionary"" sandwich.

1306,33,13,5.0,"For our wedding we received a generous $800 gift certificate to the famed Per Se as a joint wedding gift from our families. The restaurant only books up to 2 months in advance, so we found ourselves having to call at exactly 10AM, and exactly 2 months before our preferred dining date. This was slated to either be the best dining experience of my life, or the most uncomfortable as I imagined being surrounded by ""stuffy"" executives who would judge me for using the wrong fork. (For background, I was born and raised in a lower-income, inner city housing project of NYC where crime and poverty prevailed. So while I have been fortunate enough to experience some of the best foods that NYC has to offer, many have been at the mere tune of a $5 dish. (i.e. the best Vietnamese pho soup in Chinatown.) In other words, I am not compelled by the image of class and actually find that many of the pricey restaurants leverage amazing views, over-the-top decor, and impeccable service to make up for what they lack in the flavor and quality of food.)When I arrived at the address, I was immediately thrown by the oddity of its location. This critically acclaimed, once-in-a-lifetime culinary journey - all 14 courses of it- that I was about to embark on, was located in the Shops of Columbus Circle at the Time Warner Building of NYC. Of all places, a mall!! But as I arrived via escalator to the top floor of the mall, I realized that I had transcended to a place beyond stores, beyond shoppers, beyond the noise. I had arrived at the Per Se entrance and I was thoroughly excited. Contrary to what one might expect, Per Se was not obnoxiously luxurious or stuffy. There were no gold-plated fountains or giant crystal chandeliers hanging throughout. Instead, it was classy simplicity, going with the ""less is more"" approach. A unique positioning of its split-level flooring ensured that every seat in the house has a window view. The service was excellent. Servers were friendly, engaging and casual- not overbearing, but perfectly in tune with the appropriate level of interaction and timeliness. They all seemed to know that this would be a rare experience to most guests, so they did all that they could to accommodate and let us take it all in to make our culinary journey an enjoyable one.The 9-course tasting menu (which actually comes with additional courses not listed) is priced at $295 a person (tax and gratuity are included.) On the left side of the menu is a Vegetarian option, on the right side of the menu is the standard offering with steak, seafood, fois gras, etc. The guest merely picks a menu side ""Vegetarian or Standard"" and the journey begins, with beautifully artistic and amazing creations brought out, one course at a time. Because I knew we had a $200 cushion on the gift card, I opted to upgrade to the 100-day dry aged Wagyu Beef for a ""supplemental $100"". I nearly laughed out loud when my little 4oz piece of steak came out, but when I placed a slice in my mouth, I swear, it was worth every incremental penny. The beef literally melted on my palette and the steak-lover that I am conceded that it was the best cut of steak I had ever tasted in my life. But that would be the start of a trend, where everything I tasted, became my ""new favorite"". My description here does not do it justice, but if I can express anything, it is that I have learned through this dining experience that more is not better, and that food is indeed an art form. Every tiny bite explodes with such robust flavors, that it defies logic and science. Subsequently, it is with rave reviews that I encourage people to experience the wonders of Per Se. I am embarrassed and sorry for pre-judging the restaurant based on its location, and for doubting Michelin and the 324 Google Reviewers to date who have basically given it top honors. And while I will likely never get the opportunity to return, this was a once in a lifetime opportunity that was worth every penny of my final $821 bill- even without any money for wine :)",31,0.9909
1307,7,6,5.0,"So here is a little story about me and my grooming habits. Ready? Okay.I am terrible at blowing out my hair. It always looks the same, and I always end it with a flat iron, basically ruining any chances of body or waves or curled under ends. I also have my blow-drying ritual down to a science and if I stray from my long straight blow out even a little bit, it takes me forever and I can pretty much guarantee failure. Enter Drybar. I like being pampered, and really, who doesn't? I had seen an article about this blow out only salon online, as an inexpensive way to get luscious locks without slaving over my own hair and ultimately having the same old 'do. I went last Saturday with two of my friends after conveniently making an appointment via their very awesome iPhone app. We were greeted by the uber friendly and chipper front desk guy who offered us beverages and handed us a menu. Almost immediately my stylist arrived and started asking me what I wanted. They have a ""menu"" with a few different choices, but she was happy to accommodate my wish for a cross between soft waves and full body. As my other friends were seated the stylists moved around a few things so we could get our hair washed and blown dry next to each other. Bingo. Gossip and pampering all in one sitting? I love it. The whole thing took about 45 minutes, which was longer than I had anticipated, but why am I complaining about someone else making my hair look super gorgeous? AND, they offered us coffee, tea, champagne, the works. Bellinis? No problemo. I sat there happily sipping my coffee (with SOY MILK...yes, they carry soy) looking around the white and girly space, all pintucked walls and chandeliers made of yellow blow dryers...oh my. The blowout itself was pretty sweet. Volume and light curls at the bottom of my long hair, so soft and pretty. She did almost exactly what I asked for, so zero complaints here. Checking out was as easy as checking in. I paid quickly, tipped my stylist and was on my way to the bridal shower I was throwing...knowing I would have killer hair. The whole blow out cost $40, doesn't matter how long, curly or coarse your hair is. Everyone gets the $40 treatment. Bueno. Is there really anything better than taking a much needed and completely affordable break from the hustle and bustle of real life by sipping a cocktail and getting a blow out? I think not. And the feeling of looking awesome comes free of charge, so you totally get your money's worth. I should have known walking in there that my addictive personality would get the best of me...I've already booked two future appointments.Blow Dry Bar Win.",9,0.9978

It was not sitting there. Freshly cooked wonderfulness......is it time to go to Panda Dumpling House yet?!**OH-EM-GEE came here again and tried the Sesame Noodles........SOOOOOOOO GOOD. Try it, please. I had it with the regular noodles, NOT the rice noodles. Just writing this, I want some now!",24,0.8912

We may have missed the man in question by minutes, but we stayed until that gate was pulled down...What a lovely find, was the Immigrant! Jason, the owner and proprietor, is a gracious and patient host. He'll pour you beer (Captain Lawrence on tap; a small but comprehensive bottle selection) or wine (a streamlined list that manages to travel the world while keeping it accessible and pronounceable) and talk or listen as the situation requires. As you sample the carefully curated beverage list, you will meet a fabulous crowd of East Village regulars, from next-door neighbors to local (F&B) industry folks to the cute girl who inked the owner. Wander towards the back of the room and check out the cozy sexy lounge-y seating, not to mention the creatively resourceful use of the small, narrow space.This is where you ought to go for a glass of wine in the EV. There's a cava and a real Champagne (for $11 a glass! Had to try it; totally drinkable), a California Cab for $12 a glass (a steal, if that's your thing), a Grenache/Syrah rose, Sancerre and Moschofilero and everything in between. The place is named for JFK's ""A Nation of Immigrants."" The photo in the loo is inoffensively racy. It's perfect, really. My only possible beef is with the wine glasses. The wine's pretty enough to warrant some sexier stemware.This guy Jason's got a great little place. Go visit him; he'll take really good care of you.",8,0.9955

In between ducking into the little nondescript shops that lined the area between 1st Ave and Ave A, I noticed Good Beer. Yeah, this place is called Good Beer. Naturally the name itself just called to me.Not unlike most establishments in the East Village, Good Beer's space is not big. What they lacked in seating, they more than make up for in beer selection. They also have several beers on tap for customers to order and sample right in the store, with the top of a low cabinet in the middle of the floor serving as a table to put your beer. I saw a couple having a sampler of four different beers, and since there were four of us, I immediately suggested we ordered that.The beers were delicious, and also, they were playing Biggie.

The timing of the dishes was great..I figure by the time you are on your third hour of eating you've already finished digesting your first hour of food =PSmall dining space, with 12 seats wrapped around the cooking area. The high stools are not the most comfortable, but they give you a better view, and we were too wrapped up in enjoying the food and watching the chefs anyways.Loud music on the dining side, so you have to lean forward a bit to hear the chefs when they explain the dishes.

1312,8,5,5.0,"It's interesting to see such a wide range of reviews for Luna Piena, but I can assure you that the one time I've visited (so far!), everything was excellent.I actually learned about Luna Piena from the concierge at a hotel where my parents were staying across town. We were looking for a good place in Midtown East and this one was at the top of his list. It's easy to see why.The atmosphere was elegant and intimate. We sat in the back room close to the waterfall. There was quiet music on, but we could easily converse at a normal speaking volume. I tried one of the specialty cocktails, which was made with Grey Goose pear-infused vodka. Yum!The Frito Misto appetizer is awesome if you like fried stuff -- calamari, shrimp, zucchini, and mushrooms all mixed together. The lasagna del Mamma tasted truly homemade, though I can assure you that my mom's was never this good. (To be fair, we're Jewish, not Italian, so it's not really our specialty.) Luna Piena boasts a number of dessert options, from traditional (tiramisu, creme brule) to exotic (poached pear) with sorbets and gelatos in between. You can't miss.Lots of the complaints I see are about the price, and it's definitely not cheap. But our bill came out to $200, which isn't bad considering we had several appetizers, multiple drinks, and dessert. For $50 per person, you won't find a better Italian meal anywhere else. Grazie, Luna Piena.",9,0.9935
1313,10,19,5.0,"WOW. Easily one of the BEST meals I've had in a long, long time. I've already made plans to come back here tomorrow, and will be returning multiple times to try every. single. thing. on the menu.First, no, I don't get the name, and there's no heartwarming story printed on the menu about how the place came to be. But whatever! It's a Toucan! And a motha$#@in' Lion! Roll with it man. I have a fondness for Asian-inspired cuisine, so this menu's pan-asian focus was instantly appealing, with elements of Thai and Malaysian cuisine receiving particular emphasis. We started off with a drink and went with The Lion in the Summer, which was a solid concoction, though not as potent as I'd expect from a hand-crafted specialty cocktail. We then dove right into our main course, and since I'm obsessed with mussels (you are what you eat, which means I'm musselcular, yeeeeea girl), I went for the P.E.I. mussels drenched in a delectable-sounding chili curry, while my buddy opted for the famed Burger. I still can't stop thinking about the mussels - they were perfectly cooked, while the sauce was tangy, delicious, and the perfect creamy consistency for post-mussel-bread-mopping. But this wasn't served with just ANY bread, oh no - it comes with 3 pieces of immaculately toasted, lightly buttered, melt-in-your-mouth Bao buns that literally stopped me mid-sentence upon my first bite. Heaven.Then our server swung by and said, ""Hey guys, so tonight's dessert is a Kaffir Lime Pie, our Asian-inspired take on Key Lime, and bacon-glazed-donuts. We also have--"" whoa whoa whoa buddy. Are you seriously still standing there? You just put BACON and DONUTS in the same sentence and act like I care about ANYTHING you have to say after that. Our server, perhaps freaked out by our intense, ravenous reaction, quickly brought them out 2 minutes later, and we dove into one of the most mind-blowing desserts I've ever had. Four lightly glazed chocolate donuts topped with generous sprinkles of coconut shavings, little bacon bits baked into every bite, all swimming around in a fabulous vanilla reductionnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnAh sorry, got lost thinking about those little baked balls of perfection and let my finger linger on the keyboarddddddddd DAMMIT not again. Ok so clearly, I was blown away by every aspect of my meal. Now, to address some of the intangibles. The service was excellent. Our super friendly, easygoing server was fantastic throughout the entire meal and knew exactly when to interrupt, avoided refilling our water every 3 seconds like some of the more manic-compulsive servers I've recently encountered, and he delivered all of his spot-on recommendations with 100% certainty. The dude knew his stuff, and you could tell he loved working here. One caveat though - this is NOT a place to come with a group of more than 4 or 5 unless you have a reservation well in advance. They've really gotta work out their seating arrangement in general. We were unfortunately placed at the end of a communal table right next to the door, so the draft wound up kicking our poor napkins' asses everywhere anytime someone walked in or out. It was also a pain for the people sitting to our left to have to climb over me like a drunk gorilla to use the restroom or, you know, go anywhere. A few tweaks could be used to streamline things.But to truly seal the deal, we used a Scoutmob deal and got $25 bucks off our bill! I simply downloaded the Scoutmob app while we were waiting for a table and showed it to our server, and he immediately deducted $25 from our bill, no questions asked, and more importantly, no annoyance that we were one of 'those' customers using an online deal. The deal is good till August 2012 so there's really no excuse to not try this place out. A mouthwatering plate of mussels, a gourmet burger + fried pickles, 4 drinks, and an unforgettable dessert came out to $60 with tip. You honestly can't beat that. Or maybe I should say, Woohoo! As good as it gets!",14,0.9965

If you never make it to Italy, come here and get the Cacio e Pepe, because it truly is the best version I've ever had this side of the pond.

The place only seats about 40-ish or so people, so make a reservation if its a weekend. The wait staff was friendly, helpful and always checking in on us throughout the meal -- a long lost art at many restaurants in the city.Other must eats:1) artichoke salad - simple artichokes with cheese on top2) Cacio e Pepe3) the ""Chocolate salami"" dessert -- served with vanilla gelato and ""slices of salami"" which are really just chocolate ganash with gram cracker pieces to look like marble salami.

I don't even want to write much about it, because descriptive words CANNOT do this corn justice. It's the most succulent thing your lips have ever encountered. You take a bite and your teeth just sink into the thick layers of corn. As your come up for air and your nose is covered in white powder like so many Wall St. execs, you'll start to taste each flavor, first with the roasted, buttery corn, then the cheese that is melting off of the teeth marks you just made. and finally the kick of lime accentuates each flavorful morsel. And the fact that you only spent $2 for each ear makes you justify wanting to buy eight more and call it a day. This corn is that piece of food you crave when you're hundreds of miles away from Cafe Habana, lying in bed at night, wondering why you ever left a city capable of turning out such exquisitely delicious and affordable food. No fuss, simple restaurant with a charm all of its own within the trendy Prince St area. If you're hungry, go crazy and get at least two pieces. This is a 10 star establishment all the way.

1318,7,5,5.0,"last night, I, Melissa F., fell in love with a place located on the West side. this is no small feat, and a part of me isn't pleased with myself. but what can i say--the heart wants what it wants.after an ill-fated, aimless wandering search for a wine bar that didn't have a 30 minute wait for a table, my partner in crime and I decided to ""settle"" for the ""bar"" across the street from our original target. upon walking in, we were greeted by a friendly hostess who led us to a cozy table in the back of Pour George. the main bar area is extremely long and spacious, and the back seating area also offers room for small parties as well as large groups.after perusing the menu, it became very apparent to us that Pour George isn't a regular ""bar"", but rather a gastropub with an impressive menu, featuring small bites and entrees including duck, bone marrow, and oysters, as well as cheese plates and other various snacks. in terms of drinks, they have an impressive drink menu as well, comprised of various beers (both ""craft"" and ""regular""), a small, but comprehensive wine list, and a great offering of specialty cocktails. in terms of food, we decided on the cheese plate (they rock a pretty decent cheese list, and we chose 3--i don't recall which, but they were delicious), roasted beets, grilled cheese sandwich, and french fries. perhaps it was the effect of being on Weight Watchers for a week and a half, but all the above were AMAZING. dessert? yes, please! we had the nutella crepes and the whiskey bread pudding--NOTE: the whiskey bread pudding doesn't present the ""whiskey"" very subtly, and i'm pretty sure that if the three glasses of wine I had didn't make me mild to moderately tipsy, than the whiskey bread pudding sealed the deal.in terms of ""ambiance"", it's simply amazing and what made me fall in love (well, that, and the grilled cheese). not too loud, great music (including but not limited to Radiohead, The XX, Florence and the Machine), dimly lit, and SUPER friendly staff. am i going to drag my ass back to the West side to come here again? you bet!",8,0.998

1320,5,2,5.0,"Since I went to Sala One Nine I've been trying to find a reason to not give it five stars... and I can't.To begin with the mood is perfect for any occasion. It's dim, but not dark, and a little table candle lighting goes a long way. The walls are bricked but also half-plastered, which, along with the wooden floors and barrels, might have caused the restaurant to veer off into the faux-rustic category, but it's handily saved from this mediocre fate by the elaborate, gold-painted ceiling and more modern, granite bar. Sala One Nine is a classy place and it knows that it doesn't need to try to prove that to anyone. Birthday, date, special reason or casual get together, this place has you covered.My friend and I split a few dishes, every one of which was flawless. The bacon-wrapped, almond-stuffed dates were wonderful - a salty, slightly crispy exterior quickly yielded to a sweet, creamy smooth interior; a combination where each flavor and texture was readily identifiable and yet neither overpowered the other. Similar to how in less capable hands the dates could have been an exercise in decadence, the melt-in-your-mouth fried goat cheese was accentuated with a generous drizzle of honey and cut with the more earthy sweetness of caramelized onions, creating a dish that is a perfect example of the virtues of restraint by not overwhelming the palate. The patatas bravas were fried perfectly, and although that isn't too out of the ordinary, the red pepper sauce that coated the potatoes was a fantastic combination of smooth and spicy, which is rare, and meant that we couldn't stop eating them. Even after eating these great tapas, the seafood paella, which arrives in a cast-iron pan, managed to be a show-stopper. I wasn't aware it was possible to cook rice al dente, but Sala One Nine did. Just firm enough on the outside but soft on the inside, it was a pleasure to run each grain over my tongue and split it between my teeth. Furthermore, the rice on the bottom of the pan had an even more awesome crispy texture and barely-charred taste. As if that wasn't enough, the use of saffron in this dish, a flavor you can taste in every bite, at once familiar yet foreign, squarely elevated this dish into five-star territory. The seafood? Goes without saying!The service was also great. Our waitress was timely, knowledgeable and brought us a great bottle of red to drink with our meal. However, now that I'm reading the reviews I'm kicking myself for not getting the sangria :P That's a must-have for next time. The prices aren't cheap, but within the ranges you might expect of a tapas bar - not too pricey either.I feel that by their very nature tapas bars invite criticism. Because you order so many different dishes, there's a high probability that while you'll try some tapas that are excellent, you'll also try some that are mediocre or unappealing. I think it speaks to the strength of Sala One Nine that every dish I had was wonderful. When your food averages four-and-a-half stars and everything else goes perfectly, including a great atmosphere, you've earned five stars. Not even I can argue with that.",4,0.9992

Much like rest of Chinatown - decor is simple and old. There are disposable chopsticks at the table and all sauces are in recycled sriracha bottles - no names do just grab and guess.The dumplings are triangular shaped.. And when you bite in - some soup lands in your mouth.. It's the perfect mix of meat and veggies - the dumpling skin is just thick enough to have great bite.BTW. You can take the frozen dumplings home as well! ($9 for 50 pieces)!!!Love. This is what love feels like.,9,0.9807

I kinda hate you too, because now whenever I am feeling lazy and don't know what to eat for a given meal my mind immediately dances over to the idea of a rich juicy buttery LOBSTA ROLL.... oh man oh man why!?? Then I either say damnit, I dont need to spend $20 bucks on lunch right now, or... I cave in. Im proud to say I have still tried to keep ""going to Luke's"" a special treat. Reserved for splendid weather where I take my SKOONER boat to the waters edge and bask in the sunlight and say, THIS is the good life. One especially chilly day this spring when the weather dipped low in the 30s I was craving a hearty, savory soup. It happened to be a Sunday so both the Original Soupman and Hale & Hearty were shuttered in this off peak ghost town twilight zone we call FiDI weekends. Cue tumbleweed of CA$H blowing by...... howling wind sound effect and some maniacal banker sobbing up in his corporate office. Off in the distance the chanting of some OWS drum circle contingent can still be heard.Needless to say I was having the most frustrating time coming upon any decent soup within a 15 block radius.  Then that happy angel Lobster that is always on my shoulder cleared his throat and said... what about Lukes? I bet they have some kinda awesome chowdas down there and YOU KNOW it will be quality...A buttery tear of joy fell down my cheek as I near sprinted to Lukes. There I not only found their menu mainstay - New England Clam Chowder simmering away in a warm cauldron but also their - Soup of the Day, Lobster Bisque! It was like music to my ears, I said I would take both. Since clearly we were in some sort of soup depression at the moment and I needed to stock up. The soups are pricey like liquid gold 7 for the chowder, 9 for the bisque. But oh are they worth it! One of the best Lobster Bisques I have had in NYC, hands down with GIANT hunks of lobster claw meat (like the kind you get in their rolls). I will always look to Luke's now for my quality soup on a cold winters day. SO THANKFUL LUKE HAS COME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD!!!",12,0.9902
1323,13,8,5.0,"Summary: Deliciously unexpected. Fantastic service. A must try for the neighborhood.The Atmosphere: There is some outdoor seating, but the windows in the main dining area allow for plenty of light. The seating near the door is quite dark if you had a heavy night out and don't want to be near the sunlight. Tables are painted white, which makes for a delightfully modern surface.The Crowd: Taboon is the type of place that reminds you that Hell's kitchen is gentrifying. One of the trendier brunch spots for sure. You can look nice here, or you can come with morning face. Your choice. If you're of the rainbow, you will be pleasantly surprised.The Service: We had a lovely new waiter. By lovely, I mean, possibly one of the most perfect looking people I've seen in the city in a while. He was so textbook good looking that even my straight bf admitted he was attractive. As he's not my type and also I'm not convinced I had a better chance than my bf, I'm sending out the love to the Yelp community. (He works Sunday brunch, in case you are curious and want to see if he's single). Despite being brand new, he was excellent and others in management checked in regularly to make sure we were up on coffee and the like. The food: YUM!!! Wow. I don't even really like hummus and I have to rave about the hummus and bread. I had the Crab Benedict. They used real crab meat. The mixture with the spinach and hollandaise sauce was truly delightful. I even quite liked the dressing on the salad. There was a shrimp in a pan brunch dish was fantastic. It's smaller and you will want to dip the bread into the sauce in order to be full. It was tasty enough that I didn't actually care that the portion size was smallish.",5,0.9983

Smiles greet you all around and - this freaked me out a bit - every single person I passed at the front desk, hallway, etc - knew my name and greeted me as I walked by. This is before I gave them any sort of I.D. and I did not have to give them any sort of introduction. Either I really made an impression during the booking process or this is just their specific attention to detail (I'm going with the latter). They catered to my every need and even went out of their way to predict my future needs so that I would not have to worry about them. Meeting space: Conference Manager is super accommodating and the spaces are well-organized and capable of fulfilling just about any meeting need. Highly recommended. Hotel Room(s): The hotel room reminds me of a comfortable studio space. All of the TV screens in your hotel room will welcome you and all of the hotel staff are extremely accommodating. Prime location - my river views were thoroughly enjoyed throughout my stay. They have a really neat in-room dining ordering system where you can do it straight from the TV. I added some special instructions to mine (took a while) and then it wouldn't allow me to do the checkout option so I ended up calling anyway, but I like the idea. Now just tweak it to perfection, Conrad :). Prime location: Next to the river. 'Nuff said.In-room dining: Everything was prepared to perfection except for the chai latte I ordered. I ordered their farm fresh berries, oatmeal, and Chai latte for breakfast. Berries were indeed farm-fresh and the oatmeal was pretty good. I specified 8:00AM delivery time and they rang at exactly 7:59AM with my food. The Chai latte arrived lukewarm-cold and that kinda stank since I did not have a microwave to heat it back up.",5,0.9896
1325,10,9,5.0,"Thanks to my dear friend Daphne W., I think I have just discovered the best happy hour spot in the EV. Arguably one of the best happy hour deals in the entire city.Unlike the average bar/resto that offers $3 beers and $5 watered down well drinks during happy hour, Ten Degrees Bar lets you order any 2 drinks of your choice for the price of 1. That's right, ANY 2 that you heart could possibly desire! Getting everything from a full glass of crisp Sauvignon Blanc, a sweet red sangria, minty fresh margarita and dry Tom Collins... the combinations and choices are freaking endless. As you can tell, this place can get real dangerous real fast...Besides the awesome drink deal that should draw anyone with any common sense in the door, the food here isn't shabby either. I was thoroughly impressed with how fresh and flavorful the guacamole here is, served in a generous portion and seconds on the tortilla chips. The ambiance and service here is top-notch as well, as sophisticated and intimate as any wine bar - yet with the same level of service as a neighborhood joint frequented by regulars.They do fill up pretty fast after about 6:30pm.

Love the wall art decors, which reminds me of a very hip tattoo parlor of some sort. The low metallic tables and benches accompanied by red metal stools by the door seats around 10-12 people. There is a ledge on the side for those who would rather stand than sit. As you reach the counter, you'll see a red television with a snowy screen and a rubbed on sticker with the joint's name. The very sweet lady, Harriet, would take your order and she would answer any questions you have. Btw, her accent is pretty cool!Their menu is a big mirror hung high behind the counter and it is inked with a marker. After staring at the menu for quite some time, I thought I was losing my eye sight because I began seeing double images. I guess I was really hungry! But turns out if I shifted my body weight and looked at it in different angle I can see normal again - this was due to the reflection of the words. I'm telling you this is what hunger does to one!For me I will always have a love for wasabi, so when I saw wasabi chicken fingers...I am sold! Yes, I'll trade your child in for some wasabi anytime! I got the 3 piece with wasabi aioli sauce (yes I'll even trade your 2nd kid in for some of this), sticky sauce (a white bbq sauce) and chocolate chip BBQ sauce. I gotten this as a combo, which is a pretty good deal because you add $5 to your meal, you'll get a drink and a side. I chose the purple sweet potato fries with a strawberry slurp. On this foodie adventure, how can Hungry Boy not be by my side? Well for him, he got fingered alright. Yup, that's right he got the straight up finger with sunny mustard, sweet chili and the soy ginger sauces. He also made his meal a combo and gotten the Idaho Truffle Fries and a Blue Juice.Our foods were delivered to our seats by the wonderful staff. And as Yelpers, the first thing we do is major food paparazzi and making sure there was enough lighting and whatnot. Now it's time to kick back and chomp. The purple sweet potato fries were amazing! They were topped with pecan dust and coconut flakes with honey drizzled on top. This is pure genius! And this just shows how much passion the owner has for coming up with something as delicious as this! The truffle fries were crispy and very delicious too! As we were sitting there, Paul comes over and we just kept chatting away as if he's been our buddy for years! He was so sweet and awesome, that he gave us a raw slaw, which is cole slaw with chunks of avocado. He also gave us a honey mustard sauce and another sticky sauce. He was so awesome that he ""glitter bang"" my wasabi fingers and wasabi aioli sauce. The wasabi fingers were so crispy and fried to perfection that I think I'm in love...wait I AM in love! And adding the wasabi aioli sauce, it was indescribable...if I have a kid I'll trade it in too! Okay, maybe not my kid, but heck I'll even trade Hungry Boy in! The regular finger was really good too, but with my strong love and desire for wasabi - it would make the regular finger cry! The raw slaw was fresh and delicious and this is coming from someone who isn't really a slaw fan. I guess it does help with the avocado chunks. As for the sauces, my favorite one is...yes you guessed it, it's the wasabi aioli! The runner up for me is the sticky sauce and the sunny mustard sauce. I loved the glitter (Asian spices) so much that I had put some into the sticky sauce. The strawberry slurp was not very sweet, just the way I like it. It reminds me of a liquify strawberry slush. The blue juice was pretty good too. Also, their drinks and sauces are all organic and made from natural ingredients.Paul is such an interesting human being! It's his first time opening a restaurant and he just wants his staff to be themselves and be happy! He never been to culinary school, he just does this out of passion. He also loves robots because he actually has some robots in the back from his childhood. He took them out and started playing with them when there were these two little kids at the joint. He greeted everyone that comes in and was so generous that he hit them up with sauces and drinks. Alright, I realize the more I write, this section sounds like a dating profile for Paul haha. Except, I forgot to mention he likes long walks on the beach with his robots and a basketful of chicken fingers and sauces. I kid, but hey who knows, maybe he does like that?I am glad that I was able to stop by and check out this new joint. I heard they will have a rotating menu, which I know I'll definitely come back for more!",12,0.9995
1328,15,15,5.0,"Yasuda has been the closest experience to sushi in Japan outside of Japan that I have encountered thus far. The rice is exceptional and, although it should go without saying at this point, so is the quality of the fish. As some of the prior reviews have stated, this is not your fancy schmancy Manhattan establishment. Dress nicely - upscale casual - but Yasuda is not the place to show off your new Louboutins. If you prefer style over substance, there are less pricey alternatives that can spare you from the atrocities of Midtown.Let me follow this review with a few sentences of oh-my-god-I'm-so-wonderful. After reading, most of you will want me to trip and fall on an HIV needle but no worries, all self-praising rants will all be over in 1 (update: 2) swift paragraph(s). *clears throat*I lived in Tokyo long enough to stop considering ___ (insert just about every USA-based Japanese restaurant name here) to be anything other than a bastardized American version of Japanese cuisine. When you have grown accustomed to eating sushi/sashimi in the sushi/sashimi capital of the world (therefor universe!), you (i.e. me) will undoubtedly notice yourself scrunching up your nose or rolling your eyes when someone starts telling you just how awesome that Japanese takeout was and ohmygod Nobu was so good..... ew (author pauses to shudder at the horror of it all).Meaning- when I give Yasuda a five star rating it is not because I am not familiar with sushi. I am, in fact, perhaps too familiar with sushi. In Tokyo, a person can walk outside of their door and nibble on something aquatic about 2.5 seconds after it was bonked on the head with a blunt object or gutted with a knife. No, dinner at Yasuda is not the same as breakfast at the Tsukiji fish market. If you want your tastebuds to encounter that uniquely Japanese experience you are going to have to book the flight to Narita and wake up at 4am to get it. Expecting anything similar outside of Japan is, simply put, delusional. Rant over.",15,-0.9441
1329,10,3,5.0,"What a great find in the Bronx! Well, I guess it is not really a ""find"" as it seems that everyone knows about the place and when we got there early into dinner service on a Saturday evening, it was packed.The decor was upscale, but still casual. Unlike many of the restaurants on this street, 0-8-9 has not been there for 50 years. The interior is sleek and fairly modern, with a nice marble bar up front, a long hall, with a spacious dining room in the back. The crowd was also different than the other ""establishment"" restaurants on Arthur Ave - it was a young, well dressed crowd.Not to fear, as the friendly hostesses took our name and suggested we have a drink at the bar. The bar was jamming, lots of people having pre-dinner drinks. When a large group got up from the bar for dinner, we swooped in and grabbed some seats, deciding to eat at the bar. The bartender was great - knowledgeable and attentive - without being overbearing. We started of with drinks - a glass of wine (a nice heavy pour, BTW) and a Plymouth gin & tonic. The fact they have Plymouth is unbelievable and wonderful at the same time.We started off with an appetizer of broccoli rabe, which was amazing. My wife got a trio of meat in a dish with a rich tomato sauce. The 3 meats were meatballs, beef braciole, and pork skin braciole. She made short work of that dish, she absolutely loved it. I had one of their amazing Neapolitan pizzas. I ordered the margarita and added sausage. It was absolutely fantastic!! The sauce and cheese were delicious, but the crust...ohhhh the crust! Chewy and crusty all at the same time. People like to drone on and on about how good (average at best, IMO) NYC pizza is, etc. The pizza at 0-8-9 is way ahead of almost any other pizza in NYC. No questions asked.Our dining experience was incredible from start to finish. I can't wait to go back.",12,0.9975
1330,12,10,5.0,"This place is tiny: 4 tables to the right of the restaurant, and 9 stools at the bar. Best to come alone during lunch hours, or with a friend who you'll probably enjoy eating with.The menu is adorable and so informational with cute illustrations. If you want cold soba, or hot...or veggie, it tells you which page to skip to. Loves it! I ordered the sesame soba under ""vegetarian"". It came with a dipping sauce, cucumber slices, sesame seeds and the soba noodles. I didn't know eating soba noodles involved a ""hands-on"" experience. I felt like a complete fool when the cook handed me a tray with a bowl of sesame seeds with a grinding tool, a saucer with the cucumber slices and a cup with some type of liquid. I immediately googled ""how to eat cold soba noodles"", until the server came back and explained what I needed to do! How sweet! So apparently, you grind the sesame seeds (sooo fun!) and afterwards, sprinkle them on your noodles with the cucumber slices and dip the noodles in your dipping sauce. And chow down! According to google, don't over soak your noodles otherwise you won't be able to taste the delicateness of the soba. Also, it says to eat immediately after you soak them in.I got the regular size and felt that it was such a small portion, until the server came around with a tiny kettle and gave me a little information sheet on what soba-yu was and how to have it. After you're done with the dipping sauce, you pour hot water into it and sip it like soup...it will look like miso soup. Surprisingly, it was a nice sized meal.Everything about this place is cute...from the 5 cooks that you can see in the tiny open kitchen, the tiny basket they bring the bill in, the business cards = LOVEEE!!!P.S. CASH ONLY!!!",19,0.9859

I took my eight subsequent lessons with Pagan the owner. He was much less chatty, but gave helpful advice.

1332,5,2,5.0,"I get it, there's a lot of hype about Ippudo and the insane wait times can lead to unrealistically high expectations. But after eating my way through many ramen spots in the city, I still come back to Ippudo time and again. The key standouts are the pork buns (seriously amazing) and the ramen broth, making this my preferred ramen noshing locale.Pork buns are simple, fatty pork belly slices (2-3 per bun) with iceberg lettuce, zingy mayo and soft, doughy, slightly sweet buns with a squirt of Sriracha. You get 2 buns per order and I frequently find that each person needs his/her own order.The ramen broth is amazingly smoky and complex. I definitely recommend for your first time getting the Akamaru Modern and then later branching out into their other flavors, like the Wasabi ramen. The decor is surprisingly sophisticated; subtle touches of color and patterned clothes, mosaics made out of sequins and dark wood make up the palate. Once you are whisked inside, away from the madness of the crowded lobby, the restaurant itself is spacious and doesn't feel crowded. Be prepared to potentially share a table, but as soon as your steaming bowl of ramen gets set down in front of you, all you'll think about is slurping as quickly as possible without burning your mouth.",7,0.7509
1333,4,2,5.0,"Call me a simpleton, but the fish sandwich is honestly one of my favorite foods. While the delicious concoction can be found on menus from restaurants like McDonald's to wannabe seafood havens like Red Lobster, I find that the best fish sandwiches come from tucked away hideaways like Devin's.Now call me a fool, but for years, I did not even know that Devin's existed. I was drawn away by the allure and expensiveness of Famous down the street...once I tasted Devin's however...I was sold!Rusty and I walked upon Devin's one afternoon after work. With some cash on us (they don't take cards), we decided to give the hole-in-the wall establishment a go. When we got there, there were not many people waiting to be served. After placing our order for one fish sandwich ($4.50) and an order of shrimp and chips, we sat towards the back and waited to be called up to pick up our food.We must have arrived at just the right time, because right after taking a seat in the back of the narrow and dimly lit eatery, a barage of clientele came in, shouting out tons of different orders. ""Calamari!"" ""Potato Salad!"" ""Fried Plantains!"" ""Large fish and chips with lemonade!"" Commuters, neighbors, school children, they all paraded in on the Friday afternoon demanding their tasty seafood fare. Thankfully, we got our order in before the rush, and although we did have to wait a little while, we were eventually beckoned for our giant servings of food.Nestled between two pieces of split top wheat bread, three pieces of golden fried whiting were waiting for me. I slathered the sandwich with spicy hot sauce and cool, refreshing tartar sauce to compliment it. The rest was history! The sandwich was perfect, the best fish sandwich that I had ever had!The fish fry was PERFECT. Not too salty, and the fish was so meaty and moist. I ate every bite.Rusty's shrimp was also delicious, and his fries were homemade. Also, the portions were gigantic. And for a price cheaper than Famous'...it also makes Famous' clientele look like fools. I don't think that I have to tell you, although I live around the corner from Famous, I haven't spent a dime there since discovering Devin's.And yes, while the service can be terribly slow, appreciate that everything is grilled, fried or broiled to order! The staff is also very friendly and honest. The plantains are delicious, the fried food is NEVER greasy or salty and I can't wait to try the famous delicious potato salad!I'm hooked!",10,0.998

And he sounds like a higher pitched Bernie Mac. Man, that's an automatic five stars too. 2. Small, cozy venue with everyone using outdoor voices and BET in the background.3. Charles wants you to keep eating. He told me multiple times to make sure I get some fresh hot chicken. He even made the server give me extra. 4. Super saturated sweet tea - delicious and included with the buffet. Lemonade is also included but I didn't try it. 5. The food. Everything is buffet style, but they serve you. Sides include yams, mac 'n cheese, collard greens, rice, cornbread. The yams were by far the best sides, with everything else only being average. Mains include southern classics like fried chicken, brisket, chops. The fried chicken was great. While I prefer my skin crispier, the meat was extremely moist and tender. I found myself eating away without needing any sauce for moistness. I still added hot sauce for kick, though. The brisket was variable between dry and moist. My favorite dish, however, was a new one I have never had - smothered chicken. It appeared to be fried chicken smothered - nay, soaked - in gravy.

In the same borough we have places like Pain Quotidien that charge an arm and a leg for a coffee and a pastry, it's difficult to believe places like Savoy exists. Obviously they do. This place is just awesome. ""The coffee's awesome here!"" I told the girl at the register, incredulous. She just laughed and thanked me. Pastries are ridiculously enticing and mocked me for opting to get simply a coffee and not indulging in the past. Well today I indulged and am glad I did- their pastries rock! AND to my understanding, they're made in-house (at this big kitchen you can see at the back through a huge window) which makes it that much better! Not only is their regular cup of joe absolutely delicious- strong yet smooth, and it kicks Sbux drip's ass any day, their baked goods are also delicious. I caved and bought a dinner roll (I'll explain) and a goat cheese and spinach turnover. The DINNER ROLL was my mother's idea so we bought 3- one being MINE, of course. I ate it. Well, actually I took one bite. I really don't know what happened to the rest of the roll-- it disappeared before my eyes! :( The turnover was good too although I'd prefer it had more filling-- but at a mere $2, I'd gladly have it again. It was a great snack (although I'm sure the calorie intake isn't very snack-like). It was great and got me through a 3 hour work meeting-- yikes!

1337,10,5,5.0,"Spanish Harlem has for many years held it down as the place for good Mexican food, and this place was part of why. Cafe Ollin has been open for at least three years, and I used to go regularly at lunch and find the place deserted. I loved the food, the friendly owner, who also took orders and helped cook, plus the no-frills, hole-in-the-wall vibe the place exuded. Yet, I often worried the place wouldn't survive, as I'd see so few customers come in. After leaving a job I had around the corner, I stopped coming by, and just revisited for the first time in over two years. Thankfully, the place has survived, and although I never had come for dinner (it was my lunch spot), it seems like business is great. There were four or five chefs at work, plus a waitress and a cashier, a far cry from the days when it was just the owner and one guy in the kitchen. To see this business doing well was heart-warming.As for the food, I used to come here for the burritos and tortas, which are always huge and always delicious. This place uses the best ingredients and prepares their beans, rice and meats well. I would highly recommend a torta de carne enchilada, or a cemita with the same meat. The carnitas or pollo asado burritos are also delicious.On my most recent trip, however, being as it was dinner, I opted for my favorite dish (and the one I measure Mexican restaurants by): enchiladas. I was not disappointed. Although different than those from my native New Mexico, they still had everything I wanted in a good enchilada. They were smothered in spicy green chili, covered with raw onions, sour cream, and parmesan-like cheese, and stuffed with tasty chicken. Needless to say, I cleared my plate.My girlfriend had the chorizo cemita and loved it, but still could only finish one half. Another friend order the barbacoa de res and devoured it briskly. The spicy red chili smothered over large chunks of meat more resembled the carne adovada we make back home, but it looked so good I'm going to have to go back to try it myself.One final comment, I long advocated for El Paso and still enjoy the food there, but this place surpasses it in terms of flavor, quality of service, price, and humility.El Paso has opted to be the choice of the gentrifying elements of El Barrio, but this place aspires only to survive and provide delicious food.

1338,5,3,5.0,"Nestled inside the Ace Hotel is The Breslin, an English inspired Gastropub that (along with Albert Hall) is rapidly changing my perception of these establishments. This is no greasy spoon, but instead underneath its exterior of pig sculptures, old kitchy items and dark wood is an eatery and bar that takes both its food and drink seriously. I've only hung out at the bar so far, but that seems to be a good area to chill with friends or just by yourself.The staff is very friendly and if time allows, very open to engaging in conversation. The place can get crazy busy at times so if you're dining in, a reservation may be in order.My first experience with The Breslin involved its cocktails, here's a rundown:Forbidden Fruit: A mix of brandy, bitters, citrus and ginger beer, this is a rather mild tasting drink, but it sneaks up on you like a wine would. This would probably be good to have with food.Rush of Blood to the Head: Prosecco, blood orange and more, this is my favorite drink. It's sweet, but packs a punch to back up the sweetness. I think I downed three of these and was really nicely buzzed on one visit.Liquid Swords: Whiskey, Chartreuse, Curacao, - this thing is pure liquor and it packs an insane punch. A very manly drink with dark flavors that you really have to nurse.And what about food? They do that pretty darn amazingly too!Seafood Sausage: Made by the restaurant, this concoction includes fish and lobster inside a sausage on a wonderful cream sauce with some greens. It was *amazing* and I instantly wanted another. The sausage has a great chew and with the greens and sauce it's pure win.Frittata with ricotta cheese: Beautiful in presentation with tons of cheese on top, this thing is super rich, so have a drink handy to help wash it down.

Oh my sweet tiny baby Jesus, I just remembered I forgot to tell you about the amuse bouche courses.1. In a huggably warm large shot glass were three perfect layers to start dinner: creamy foie, dark purple port, and parmesan foam on top, which managed to be the lingering, subtlest flavor that I marveled in stunned silence while our second course was prepared.2. Chilled white asparagus soup, surely inspired by Miró, centered with a garlicky tomato dollop, generous caviar on a creme fraiche pillow at 12 o'clock, a couple other colored dots of flavor here and there, and the two most pungent microbasil leaves I've ever met.3. (Yes, three unannounced starter courses.) Raw hamachi tightly cuddling mashed avocado, improved a thousand times by julienned mint leaves and citrus vinaigrette, sour notes biting through every half second or so. This was my friend's favorite bite of the night.I think we were talking more about which cast members in Newsies were cast from SYTYCD over the second appetizer course, creamy asparagus soup over lobster, trumpet mushrooms, and cashews; and perfect, perfect spaghetti with razor clams and roasted tomatoes.God is good, and the chefs were kind to give us a five-minute respite before the main course. His Wagyu with wasabi spinach was perfect to behold, but I was too full to try it. I barely had two nibbles of my veal/chicken/ham pate, but it's perfectly wrapped in a Four Seasons box in my fridge, and something tells me it'll make good leftovers.I hope I'm doing an adequate job communicating how incredible it all was, because it was one of the finest meals I've had, emotional vulnerability notwithstanding.Of course, the gracious chef came out to say hello before dessert. Tart yogurt sorbet and prickly pear preceded our our heavenly chocolate ""Tendance,"" which (of course) was accompanied with another unrequested treat, a bubble of shiny blown sugar filled with elderflower cream and pineapple sorbet. Of course my espresso had a foamy smile on top.

1340,6,2,5.0,"If you've never been on one of the Tenement Museum tours, I encourage you to try one out. Yes, they are $20 a pop. But it is absolutely money well spent.At least one of the tours is a living history tour -- your guide is in character and in costume. However, this is not true of all the tours, so it's best to check in advance. Please also check their website to see what floor each tour is on. I mention this, because there are no elevators. Personally, I hoof it up 3 flights of stairs at least once a day, because I live in a walk-up. But walking up to a 4th floor apartment isn't for everyone -- if you're bringing small children, someone with bad knees, or heart problems, you might want to aim for a tour that explores an apartment on lower floor. (This is what I did when I brought my mom, who had finally recovered from a dislocated ankle -- going to the 2nd floor was doable. Going to the 4th floor, not so much.)The amount of history that the guides cram into each tour - complete with documents from actual former residents of of the apartments, and often with audio recordings of conversations etc. - is amazing. You learn so much and it is not at all dry or tedious. You get a real sense of how it was to live in the tenements, and what challenges the residents faced as immigrants. On both tours I attended, every single person was completely focused on the guide. Both times, I left wanting to immediately do an another tour that same day -- and would have, if I hadn't already had plans mapped out for the day.The Tenement Museum experience has, both times, been an utter delight, and I plan to eventually do each tour that is offered.

On the remote chance that he isn't there, the door says Vault in large print. I almost wish this place was harder to find, because they change the music to top forty stuff whenever the bar is crowded, which is...every weekend. And as much as I'd like to, society frowns on people drinking on Tuesdays. There goes listening to Duke Ellington and swilling bourbon. It's ok, Vault, I love you anyway. I hope losing ""at Pfaff's"" and ""the"" isn't too forward.The waitresses look like ringmasters, the menu is folded like a newspaper, and the cocktails are sixteen dollars, but it's somehow not pretentious. You get the typical ""we aren't thirty yet, I promise! watch me bro it up as proof"" suit and tie crowd, but I got the sense that nothing could take away from the laid back yet elegant vibe of the place. It's a feeling a bar achieves from being the genuine article, not a cheesy Mad Men-esque caricature. We came for the Yelp Drinks special, but I could honestly say that I'll go again, sans special, because it's worth it. The Subway Rumble was my favorite drink of the night, mostly because I like scotch, but everything we tried was phenomenal. Our waitress was also incredibly knowledgeable, helpful, and accommodating. When she talked me into trying the Bohemian, she checked with me multiple times after I received it, assuring me that if it was too sweet she would happily take it off our tab and bring something else. The Leaves of Grass actually came with a piece of grass, which we tried using as a stirrer, somewhat effectively. It was probably the strongest tasting drink of the night, but it was still balanced and eminently enjoyable. The Ada Clare was a little sweet for me, but it was perfect for her. Our waitress talked me out of getting a Melkor's Ghost, even though I was ordering it 80% for the name. Maybe next time.I could talk about this place for much longer than this review warrants, so I'll sum this up by saying places like this make me thankful for Prohibition.

It could be very easy to pass right on by and only notice a few people sitting in the window with their wicker ensconced candle-light. We arrived and were shown to a high scrubbed-pine table. Soft, rhythmic, South African tunes pulsated through the speakers and the vibe was sort of cellar-chic. It seats only about 30 plus a few chairs at the bar and that's just perfect, because I love the cozy, intense vibe.Our server/sommelier was knowledgeable and explained to us the regions and methods of all the SA wine were sampling. Once I tried the SA white Chenin Blanc there was no going back. It was like liquid heaven. I had seconds....okay, thirds. Let's talk appetizers! Ostrich sliders with apricot compote! Deliciously light and sweet! They also have chicken and elk. In addition, I had the 'Spear and Shield' which were bacon-wrapped seared asparagus spears over portabella with a delicious peppercorn sauce. Simple, yet amazingly satisfying. Most of us settled on the bunnychow - it sounded so delicious. The bison meatballs were tempting but the garam masala chicken sounded wonderful. It came in a breadbowl. It was piping hot with deliciousness and while it was super-spiced, it was at the exact right level. Served with sides of chakalaka and a cooling yogurt sauce that was complementing respite.Save room for the malva poeding! One of (if not the) best desserts I have ever tried.

Well, not literally that is, but I could turn into a thanatophile just for Death + Company.I finally came back to Death + Company following a brief rendezvous over the summer after the infamous Yelp Ice Cream Crawl. During that visit, I did not drink and barely ate anything as I was stuffed with a 1,000 calories worth of dairy products. Boy did I make up for that mistake with this week's indulgence of drinks and dinner! Now I feel like I can give it the proper review it deserves.So in all honesty, I had scheduled to go to Milk&Honey that night with friends but they had to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances. Determined to go out and show off my new dress that I had just bought the day before, I called on a backup buddy. We decided to head somewhere were we could eat and drink and have a catchup conversation. I was very adamant about going to a speakeasy so Death + Company seemed perfect as I was reminded by a fellow Yelper how amazing the bites are here.When you first arrive at Death + Co., you should be greeted by a man outside donning an outfit that gives a nod to the old styles. Suspenders, fitted trousers, button down shirt, homburg hat- something of that nature. He'll ask you how many is in your party and alert you to a wait time if there's any. (Note: One time I stopped by on a Saturday night around 8 o'clock and I was informed that the wait time would be 3 hours... yikes!) This time around, the bar had not yet gotten completely full so he guided me into the dark lit room to a booth on my right. There I waited for my company to show up as I pored over the menu in the flickering candlelight. While waiting, I looked upon the room from my corner and watched the bartenders hastily at work shaking and mixing drinks as orders came in from thirsty patrons in front of him. I was amused by how inbetween his arm workouts the bartender within my line of sight was happily conversing with those at the bar. I love down to earth bartenders. Major points.After a few minutes of waiting, I decided to go ahead and order a drink. There are so many drink options to choose from from the menu that making a final selection can be quite difficult. I chose to have the ""Death from Above"" as it was a rum based drink. I could not tell you now even with a gun to my head what the other ingredients were as the words were pretty much all alien to me. Shortly thereafter I received my Death from Above from the waitress. I took one sip and hello I'm drunk! Drinks here are definitely on the pricier end but you have to remember two things. 1. This is a speakeasy, not your normal bar. and 2. They are freaking strong as in can start a car strong. Unless you're looking to get plastered or acquire a DUI, I wouldn't have more than one of these bad boys within an hour. Sip, don't glug.My friend arrived and quickly ordered her signature Manhattan straight up to catch up with me. I'm not a huge fan of Manhattans but she said hers was very well made. I'll take her word for it. After debating on what to pick from the bites menu (I would have ordered everything if I could afford it), we picked a solid compilation of choices. Now unfortunately for me, this friend of mine doesn't eat mammals so the filet mignon, crispy pork belly and lamb chops would sadly have to wait until my next visit. That certainly won't be a problem though as I am anxiously figuring out now on when to return.Our selections for the evening:-Beet Salad (baby beets and candied ginger slivers mixed with sliced almonds and goat cheese): Great melange of textures and flavors. I adore a good beet salad. So simple yet so delicious.-Truffle Macaroni ( aged cheddar and truffle bread crumbs): The presentation of the mac and cheese was/is brilliant! It is brought out to you in individual serving spoons on a platter! So perfect for a group. The macaroni was superb -creamy and the breadcrumbs gave it that extra little oomph with texture. -Crab cakes (crab cakes served with balsamic vinegar reduction sauce): Our least favorite of the night but still ok. I didn't like the accompanying salsa- it didn't compliment the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar reduction which was heavenly.-Tuna tartar (with crushed avocado and homemade kettle chips): Mmm fabulous tuna tartar. Definitely recommend it.-Lobster Brioche Rolls (with crunchy jicama, apple, and fennel slaw): Interesting spices but yummy with big pieces of lobster meat. Overall, great service, food and drinks. Our waters were constantly refilled and our waitress made sure we were satisfied throughout our tenure. I can't wait to return to Death + Co. to try more of their amazing liquid concoctions and attack the mammals on the bites menu. Death is calling me.Also, I'm just throwing this out there. These next 17 words are for the cute guy working the front door Monday night in the pink shirt: if you're straight and single, I was the brunette in the leopard print dress that evening.

I am a big fan of the Williamsburg location and now that there's one on the Bowery I can visit them more often! Now let us talk about the new location... one word: BEAUTIFUL! The decor is absolutely stunning, chandeliers, walls, writings on the wall, pictures, oven, chairs... everything impressed me and believe me I am not easy to impress. If I like something it must look and be that good !The appetizers are extremely good my faves were the zucchini blossoms, rice balls, and a salad with berries and ricotta salata. Now the main reason I love this gem of a restaurant is the PIZZA! This is hands down the best pizza I ever had. The vomero is so flavorful and you just don't want it to end. The truffle oil pizza with arugula will always be my favorite ( the smell alone makes me crazy). The montanara what can I say besides thank you for coming into my life and making it that much better. Now if you think this little piggy didn't leave room for dessert you are wrong, I always have room for sweets. The nutella pizza and little fried dough topped with nutella are absolutely mouthwatering mmmmmmm thinking about it makes me hungry. So yes I recommend for you to check out Forcella because everything is great here from the service to the decor to the food!",12,0.9949

Don't let the long-haul eternal line intimidate your desire for breakfast or a simple afternoon brunch for a kiss off. There's always a line at Tompkins Square Bagels irregardless time of day, but it moves moderately. As patrons wait on line your order is placed and delivered to the visible kitchen, thus by the time you reached the cashier it's awaiting for your presence by first name basis. Space is very cramped between the line and the limited seating area. For one measly onion bagel sandwich consisting of ham and cheese (no drink) totals a whooping utter $6.45. Toppings galore may be pleasurable to the stomach and eye but it is not a pleasure to my lack thereof profound budget. Toppings galore-literally, Nutella chocolate, avocado, favored cream cheese, etc. Amid, the high utter price I would surely return for Challah French Toast or a garlic bagel with Monterey Jack cheese...

1346,5,4,5.0,"You know it's a good sign when you haven't even gotten through the hors d'oeuvres and you feel like you've already had the best meal of your life.Seriously, they need to serve a straw with every dish so that you can suck up every morsel and drop of sauce from every possible nook and cranny. The flavour combinations were so nuanced and poignant that I cannot stop thinking about them. Sea urchin cappuccino with green apple and crab? Outstanding. The show-stopping flavours were also littered with a prevailing sense of well coordinated playfulness. Their take on the ""clam bake"" was part performance as hot water was poured over hot stones and seaweed, releasing the aroma of the sea as you enjoy a delightful series of preparations of clams and lobster. However, it was really the deceptively smooth clam chowder that warmed inconspicuously on the hot stones that reminded us that the most simple thing can often be the most delicious.Another highlight was the guinea fowl, which was hands-down one of the most tender preparations I have ever experienced. Sous-vide'd and then roasted, each bite of butter-soft fowl made me almost forget that there was a superbly piece of seared foie waiting on the side.But speaking of foie - the foie terrine was breathtaking. The intense creaminess of the terrine was balanced beautifully by the sweet and crunch of the surrounding crisp: I swear, I thought I almost shed a tear with each bite I took, realizing that it was only bringing me closer to the end of that dish.But these are just a few of the highlights of the tasting menu, which was still full of other amazing dishes such as lobster lasagna, potato gnocchi, and goat cheese and beet lollipops, just to name a few. The entire tasting menu was so beautifully crafted, I don't see how I could come back and not want to do it all over again.What I would also be remiss if I failed to mention was also the amazing wine pairings. Not only were we served the most amazing wines, but I loved how they also brought into play a great Belgian beer, the smoothest sake I have ever experienced, and an uber-lush glass of madeira wine. And every single pairing? Fantastic.What more can I say? The one thought that did come to mind was ""how does this compare to Per Se?"" One one hand, the presentations and portions did not feel as ""grand"" as Per Se, and you do not get completely flooded with as many sweets and chocolates at the end of the meal. But I felt that the flavours and execution were absolutely on par, the service was just as spectacular, and there were certainly moments of brilliance in their food when I thought they convincingly out shone their more expensive counter part.But I do not want to take away from EMP with comparisons. It is an absolutely outstanding restaurant, a dining experience that you will not easily forget and will want to re-live soon, and soon again. And yes, I'm pretty stoked that EMP got to be my 200th review!",8,0.9967
1347,11,7,5.0,"I usually get my banh mi (not bahn mi) fix at Saigon. The Chinatown joint is good but they are nothing compared to Xe May. Since I have always love pork on my sandwiches, I had to try the ""Super Cub Classic."" It is the first listed item on their sandwiches menu and is made up of barbecued pork, pork roll, headcheese and pate with daikon radish, pickled carrot, cucumber, fresh cilantro, spicy mayonnaise, jalapeno, black pepper and optional sriracha.The meats were moist and incredibly tasty. The fact that it was not too greasy made it even better. It was different from the traditional meat and I liked how they were thinly sliced and encased by the perfectly toasted baguette. I love the crunchiness of the fresh bread because it was really savory, and yet it wasn't too hard to scrape the top of my mouth. Believe it or not, the crumbs flew out of my mouth during each bite. I actually felt sorry for the people that had to clean up my mess.Even though the sandwiches are a good size and adequate enough to fulfill a lunch or dinner appetite, I would love to see a higher meat-to-bread ratio in the future. Must try the whole wheat baguette as well (which was sold out during my visit). Can't get enough of meat and fiber!With all due respect to the traditional banh mi, the best sandwiches these days are the ones with a variety of creative flavors. You can find them here. For those of you who love new-style banh mi sandwiches, this is the place to be.Xe May deserves 5-stars for the great food at the right price with awesome service. I would definitely come back to try the tacos, salads, sides and the exotic drinks. And of course, the yummy sammies!",16,0.9988

Oh dear buttermilk fried chicken, I love you even more now than when I first heard you were on the menu.It happens. I was lured by Restaurant Week. Then I heard that the specials of the day were all part of the plan for me to give in. A glass of Chardonnay was placed in front of me. Upon first sip, cold and crisp with a fruity finish, I fell into the downtown beat. David Burke Kitchen has sort of a rustic farm house swagger. I surrendered to the food party.We sat in close quarters in a snug two top corner table. A basket of bread (Pretz sticks included) and miniature carrots were placed upon us. The butter, seasoned, was housed in a jar. Throughout the night, I came to learn that David Burke Kitchen loves jars. Our waitress, rambunctious (did she really just yell out *BAM* when they placed down the pork chop?!), was excellent in the art of making us salivate over food. Really, everything sounded good, and I believe you cannot order wrong at David Burke Kitchen. The dishes are huge, the appetizers alone could make for an entrée. Fear not, all three courses are included in Restaurant Week. It's as if they were giving away the food for free. I'm excited to return. Next time, I can eat for two - me and this food baby!Our meal consisted of:Appetizers-The Angry Octopus (This is a trip to Spain with chorizo, white beans, lemon juice, and the most tender octopus ever.)-Mushroom and Onion Tart (The star of this dish was the bacon wrapped egg. It was slightly runny and provided a nice sauce to the tart. Beautiful and picture worthy!)-Smoked Pastrami Salmon (This was impressive and tasted better than it sounded. Beer foam? Pretzel toast? Get it.)Entrée-Buttermilk Fried Chicken (Juicy chicken in a cast iron pan. Buttermilk biscuits. Cheesy grits. GRAVY!)-Pork Chop with mango chutney and parsley onion rings (We dubbed this the man pork chop. It was large and in charge. I liked the bright green onion rings. Everything complimented each other on this dish. Win.)-Short Rib and Cavatelli (I loved the cavatelli. It had a great texture and a mushroom rich sauce. The short rib? I didn't care for it so much. It was dry.)Dessert-Butterscotch Panna Cotta (This was amaaaaazing!!! Not your ordinary plain Jane panna cotta. This was custardy and modern. I loved that it was served in a Mason jar. I loved the meringue sticks. The butterscotch is at the bottom. This was like a parfait of panna cotta.-Plate of cookies. David Burke Kitchen gives Mrs. Fields and Nutter Butter a run for their money.)-Chocolate Cream Cheese Bar with hazelnut whipped cream (Extremely good. It was beautiful too but gone in a blink of an eye. My friend ate it so fast I swear she inhaled it.)I would gladly do this dinner over in a heartbeat. So this is what I've been missing out on in the last 10 years... I think I made up for lost time at David Burke Kitchen. And for the record, no I am not preggo. I'm just fat from dinner.",35,0.989
1349,11,11,5.0,"In the 2 years my girlfriend and I have been dating, she's mentioned a handful of times how we should grab dinner here. This coming from a person whose last meal would consist of steamers, raw oysters and a quality brew. Finally, we got reservations this past weekend. I always thought ""Gimmicky name, on the UES side? Ehhh probably a forgettable dinner when it's all said and done"". Well, I was wrong, like I usually am.So we were seated on a busy Saturday night right in the middle portion of the restaurant. I was facing a mural of a beach scene with a few fisherman and in mural, these two fisherman were speaking to me the entire night. We start off with some raw Rhode Island oysters. After slurping them all up and feeling a seafood buzz coming on (apparently), I could of sworn these two fisherman said ""Great choice"" and ""We just picked those today"". Without a doubt some of the freshest oysters I've had in NYC. Later, I go with the mussels with the Maine broth, which consisted of lobster, smoked bacon, chowder and parsley. If you were like me and it's your first time, just do yourself a favor and get this variety. Yes, they have a whole page of different varieties, but I think this one is the way I mussel broth should taste, plus once you polish of the actual mussels, you can dig out the chunks of bacon and lobster and munch on those. So two beers deep and half way through, I could of sworn these two fishermen winked at me, nodded and one whispered ""Delicious, aint' it!?"". Also, be a boss and get the truffle fries. If you get the standard fries, you deserve a good smack. Ahhhh. The grand finale, the donuts. First off, time to throw that New Years resolution out the window. These donuts are the truth. Even if you don't have a 'sweet tooth', you WILL like these so just order some. I split 4 with my girlfriend. All were warm, sweet and outrageously delicious. If you're like me and prefer sweets over fruit flavors, go with the fluffernutter and salted caramel. Huge props to the Georgia peach flavored one too.Other notes:-Legit beer list-Attentive service, even on a busy night-Reasonable prices for amazing seafoodTime to ditch that Friday or Saturday date with that person you're probably not even gonna score with and make reservations here for dinner and do yourself right. Ah, reservations. A definite must on the weekend, unless you like being nut-to-butt with 50 other folks.

They're very cool and patient teachers too. Above all, they's good teachers. They're very easy to learn from. Their teaching methods are totally fluid and comprehensible.Each class starts out by breaking you down with military style physical training. Once you get accustomed to these, you'll be in the shape of your life- believe it. The second part of each class includes fully hands on real life combat and fighting situations and techniques. Strong emphasis on REAL LIFE. Krav Maga is 100% FULL CONTACT. You will be trained to defend yourself in the real world, without a doubt.

Inspired by the screening of Fela outside the Adam Clayton Powell State Building, we moseyed on over to the Shrine for some food. As we walked in, a band was playing and sadly, my companions were a bit turned off by the volume and probably the sound on its own, and decided to eat outside instead. I, however, was thoroughly digging the band playing and wished we had stayed inside (however, it was loud enough to have been difficult to hear/talk, which was the point of our convening). There was such an interesting and eclectic crowd there (I agree with that assessment, other reviewers). I literally saw a crew of kids that looked like a United Colors of Benetton version of a Kid N' Play movie or the TV show A Different World (high-top fades, dookey chains, shoulder pads, and all). It was amazing. Also, the best part: I had THE best fried chicken I've ever had in NYC. I went in on that chicken, no lie to the 45th power. I'm morally opposed to the idea of chicken wings too (why would I want to eat a bone with some strands of chicken on it? You can take that elsewhere. Drumsticks or bust!), but it was pretty bomb. And to make it even better, I could get my chicken with a side of fried plantain! Shrine, are you trying to steal my heart? Because you have. It is yours, xoxo. The service was good too, to boot. I definitely want to make my way back there another night for a) my chicken fix and b) to partake in the imbibing and hear the live music. Seems there's often bands there of different musical flavours (afropunk, afrobeat, jazz, reggae, etc.), which is rawesome. It generally just seems like a super cool place to hang with your posse (or perhaps to recruit folks for a posse, which I'm trying to do. Inquire if you're interested!).

I guess that's what happens when you fall in love. I kept hearing about Maialino and of course felt like I was the last to try it. This is the story of my life. I went for dinner with a co-worker on a Wednesday night. We both wanted to try something new and this was halfway between her apartment and mine. The bar was packed and the wait was a half hour. That's okay with me for dinner. By the time we get a round of drinks and chat for a few, time's up and we are being seated. That's pretty much exactly what happened. We got Kier Royales at the bar because champagne seemed like a good choice at the time. Once we were seated we switched to wine, and liked whatever white the server suggested. She was friendly, nice, non-intrusive and informative. Oh-so-good at her job. Love that already. We looked over the menu and wanted to try a little bit of everything, but our wallets cried for help and we settled on appetizers and dinner. I started with the Baccala. It's a pretty traditional Italian dish, and executed well can be pretty amazing. Baccala is salted cod lightly battered and fried. It should be delicate, flavorful and crispy. Maialino made all those things come true. For an entree, I decided on the ravioli special, which was a potato puree with spinach and Parmesan inside. One enormous ravioli was delivered to my table. I was actually a little disappointed. I wanted more than one! Who do these people think they are?! Don't they know a hungry girl when they see one? But the ravioli was incredibly filling, surprisingly so. Success. I liked this place so much that I returned that same week for Sunday brunch with my mom. She was coming into town for brunch and said she wanted to try something new. Maialino was still in my head from the amazing dinner I had, so I booked up the last slot...10:30AM. We wound up ordering a ton of food. She wanted to try everything like I had at dinner. My mom is good like that. We Italians just can't get enough. We started with the Baccala, because I told her how delicious it was, and it's one of her favorites. Then we had fried artichokes with anchovy bread sauce and I feel like I would have snacked on those all day. You might be thinking that we stopped there with the brunch appetizers. No such luck. We are either awesome or disgusting. I think awesome. We then ordered the toffee glazed Brioche because it was brunch after all. Oh my goodness gracious that was incredible. I could have eaten 10 of them. We then order main courses, because, to reiterate, we are awesome, and I asked for the poached eggs with brussel sprouts and buttercup squash. That dish was the best brunch dish I have ever had. I adore both brussel sprouts and squash of all types and this dish was perfectly savory. I don't even have the words to tell you about it. Basically you have to go there and order it for yourself. Yeah, it's that good. They even had a dessert menu for brunch. Can you believe that? I literally couldn't eat one more thing. I felt like I might explode. It was touch and go there for a while. A while back I wrote about how much I love Clinton Street Baking Company for brunch. Now I love this place just as much and they have more tables, take reservations and credit cards, and is much closer to my apartment.

The Strip House experience begins when you open the door into a Big Red Room that is reminiscent of the 20s with its plush wallpaper, red leather seats, and black-and-white photos. There are small lampshades on every table sheltering a candle, which adds to the romantic ambiance. The optional sides range from black truffle creamed spinach to green beans to french fries, and everything I tasted was incredible. Literally, everything. Even the appetizers were worth reviewing: we got two specials, oysters on the half-shell and a beautiful salad of yellow and red tomatoes, mozzarella, and a homemade vinaigrette. We paired our meal with a Spanish red wine, and were both impressed by the expansive (and expensive) wine list. For dessert we tried Baked Alaska, which, amazingly, I had never tried before.

Highlights include the options for seating - with a long bar, a few easy tables up front and a large dining area in the back there is a lot to choose from, and all lit with soft old-style bulbs that make everyone look cute. The menu is varied and local-ish, with standouts in the grilled cheese, fried pickles, shrimp salad, sliders, and I'm sure many other things we didn't have time to try. Prices on food were a fair $8-15 for appetizers, $20-30 for entrees. If I have one (minor!) complaint it's that some plates from the same sections had very different portion sizes, such that I envied my friends shrimp salad and wondered where the rest of my beets were. Mixed drinks were great, the bartender flexible and happy to please, beer selection was also a hit, and happy hour provided us ample opportunity to feel as if we were saving money and had choices on how to do so to boot (money which we then clearly spent on countless treats after the 7 o'clock witching hour passed.)Seriously, if you like feeling as if you've discovered something wonderful, while at the same time realizing you feel as if you are in your favorite neighborhood spot, come to sit with friends and talk for hours, or to go on a hot date (with sexy lighting!), enjoy a delicious meal or just pop in for a good stiff drink... you should go to Pour George, stat.

Instead of ordering when she returned, we handed over the basket and asked for another serving of cornbread first! LOL I had the smothered dark meat chicken with candied yams and delicious cheesy mac and cheese. My roommate had the fried chicken with black eyed peas and mac and cheese. You could tell we were hungry because we almost licked our plates clean in under five minutes!What a great choice we made, and we will definitely be returning here again soon!",6,0.9773
1363,14,7,5.0,"This place is ridiculously good. I am baffled as to how Loeser's still exists after such a huge demographic shift in the Bronx over the last 50 years. I guess it's a testament to the quality of the food and the steadfastness of the owner, who has ensured that all of the the Jewish classics he makes are still top quality and made with great care. This is one of those under the radar places that doesn't get the accolades that Katz's, the 2nd Ave Deli, and Barney Greengrass do. But Loeser's is absolutely in the same league, if not the best out of all of them.Lunch was about $30 for 2, and included sandwiches, soups, cole slaw, pickles, and drinks. A bit pricey for the area, but you're getting some of the best Jewish food anywhere.Without a doubt, this is a five star Jewish deli. Worth a special trip up to the Bronx.",20,0.443
1364,12,4,5.0,"Honestly, I'm suprised the line was not longer. Ralph's has the word ""famous"" in the title like many establishments, but this one is truly deserved. I'm still astonished at the amount of delicious treat you get for a measly price.A symphony of flavor for a hot day.They have all the necessary items a small frozen treat stand should have, but the menu is most important in its flavors of ice and milk varieties. Both are tasty and perfect for a hot day, but it simply baffles me (I might have mentioned this already) how they can give you so much for so little money. I would expect an inferior product, but that is nowhere close to what you are served. I'm glad there is now a location that does not require my travel to Staten Island or Long Island.",12,0.9852
1365,37,33,5.0,"Being a craft beer connoisseur I was floored when walking by the other day and discovering this enclave of malt and hops. Shelves upon shelves of craft style beers, ciders, and hard to find imports are all on hand to try out and enjoy. In fact, when asking the owner how many they actually carry he replied ""close to 500"". Stouts, porters, ales, high alcohol content - ohhhh myyyyy!!!I shed a tear, and hugged him.Oh, who am I kidding? I just love to drink good beer being the lush that I am! City Swiggers is a godsend that has taken up residence in Yorkville / UES. It's an area that desperately needs more unique shops such as this, and that are slowly but surely popping up in once empty store fronts that dot the area. No more heading downtown below 14th street or to Brooklyn to find a quality beer retailer, as this location fulfills all beer consumption needs. It makes perfect sense for City Swiggers to put up shop here, as this area is known as one of the most densely populated residential parts of the city. 86th Street has seen a boom in name brand retail stores open recently, and when the 2nd Ave subway is finally finished will end up bringing in even more businesses and shoppers this way.I could see they are already having some success judging by the amount of people coming in and purchasing all types of beers while I was there. Up front there is a large communal wooden tasting table surrounded on one side by a large shelving unit stocked full with amazing craft beers, and on the other side refrigerated units filled to the brim with cold tasty goodness. People were milling all about choosing beers to take home, some grabbing a cold brew to consume there, and others looking to sample one of the 14 beers on tap. Yes, 14 craft beers on tap that will rotate every few weeks, all around $7 a pint. Very eclectic selection to choose from, and free tastings if you want to check out your palate before choosing one. The husband and wife owners were very nice and chatted with me for quite a while, and also let me try a few before I settled on a terrific glass of Innis & Gunn Rum Cask. Delicious!She also told me the demand has been so overwhelming that they are having trouble keeping some of the beers in stock. That is a good problem as it shows people have found out about this great store and are shopping there. As they are fairly new some kinks need to be worked out, but that is expected. Be patient and support these great local businesses.They also have growlers to purchase at $5 deposit for the bottle and then cost is determined by what beer you fill it up with. So much more convenient than schlepping downtown to pick up and refill a growler, and worth the cost for convenience. I did have a chance to notice and compare individual bottle prices on the craft beers and found them to be quite fair, if even pretty inexpensive overall. The cider and hard to find import section in the back of the store has some really keen selections, and is pretty impressive as many I had never seen before.The store itself is well lit, has a nice relaxed retail vibe, and also has a decent amount of seating/ tables to sit at and enjoy your beer purchase. They need to put on some background music at a low level though, but that is a minor flaw. This is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood, and I hope they are around for a long time. Go Yorkville!

1366,11,2,5.0,"One again, Tom Colicchio impresses me. The first and most prominent quality I noticed about this restaurant was the woodsy décor. It flourishes throughout the venue, from the wood burning fire place in the café to the wall of stacked fire logs. It really puts you ""right there"" where the designer wants you to be: back to nature, well...maybe a trendier and more expensive nature. The service was outstanding, I cannot stress it any more. From the moment we walked in (hostess) to the moment we left (servers, all staff) everyone seemed happy to be working there and happy to serve. I felt like a guest in someone's home. We had a large party of 12 and there was probably 5-6 staff for our table; 1 main server and 5 runners/bussers. They brought all of our entrees out at once, so nobody was left waiting...I love when restaurants do this. They were friendly and were attentive to our empty glasses of wine....wait, were our glasses ever empty?The food, it was incredible and unique. We shared apps...a mixture between the sweet bread (by far the best...had I known it was pig intestine I would have not eaten it!), ahi tar tar, hamachi and risotto. For my entrée I had the scallops which were fresh, with a mixture of woodsy, earthy flavors...again tying in with the restaurant's overall theme. I mean, you can't really go wrong with Mr. Colicchio....It was a pretty penny...but one of those meals where you gladly hand over your AmEx and say, ""Worth it, worth every penny"".

1367,17,15,5.0,"Good afternoon, I'd like to buy the whole store. Yes, the whole store. All the macarons, the melon pan, the ice cream - just put it all in a big take out container. Oh, and would you throw in one of those lovely napoleons too? EVERYTHING I tried here was delicious. I tried a really unique wasabi bread, which seemed oily, but really added to the subtle hint of wasabi. It wasn't spicy, but refreshing in an odd way. The melon pan was sweet on top and slightly chewy and delightful. My hands down favorite has got to be the macarons. From the matcha to passion fruit to goma (black sesame), each delectable bite is the perfect consistency - a delicate crunch of the shell, the chew of the cookie, the buttery cream. Its served chilled, but not cold enough to shock you. The cold actually enhances the subtle flavors. The macaron, even when I bought it at the end of the day, was not soggy or hard or unpleasant. Also the size may look small, but its pretty thick and fluffy. It might have been the best macaron I've ever had. I normally would reserve a star just because I haven't tried everything, but the service is really superb. I arrived five minutes after Takahachi had closed for the evening. The manager or owner saw me looking plaintively in through the glass door and happily opened back up for me and Jon F. to run inside for goodies. We were served with smiles even after a long day at work, and received a free pastry to boot.I love this place. x3",19,0.9969
1368,8,4,5.0,"When my friend from Canada was from here, she surprised me by saying that tariffs for U.S. running shoes are so high in her homeland that she was stoked to stock up while in NYC...city sales tax be damned! She met up with another friend and came back with two pairs of sneakers, raving about this place called Paragon.Since I'm not a runner, I forgot about this information until I started needing a new swim cap. I almost went on an online ordering binge, then realized that I wanted one right away, and that I wanted to see it before buying it. When I searched for city stores selling a passable range of swimming equipment, I came up with Modell's and Paragon Sports. Modell's, of course, was sort of a bust; just a boring streamlined selection, and I wanted more options.So, my first visit to Paragon was after work, when I stepped into this multi-story wonderland of sporting goods and apparel. It was like falling down a rabbit hole to a different state where people can actually be outdoors.I made a beeline for the swim counter on the second floor, but noticed a ton of other stuff on the way; organic ladies' apparel on sale, yoga clothes, Underarmour, camping gear, tennis rackets, and on and on.The man at the swim counter was beleaguered by an overbearing man and his bratty daughter, who were asking about goggles. Luckily for me, there were sample caps spread out artfully over the counter, and I fondled and stretched them until I had a few candidates. When the pesky customers left, I asked the man for his opinion, and he helped me confirm the choice of a newly designed white silicone cap from Speedo. Very happy with it.I wasn't sure at first where to check out, so I walked a couple steps to the watch and accessories counter, where another attentive salesperson directed me around the corner to an easy checkout, bypassing the ground floor clusterfuck.The second time I stopped at Paragon was when a dear friend, meaning well, bought me about ten gel packets, a pair of goggles, and a fanny pack type contraption prior to my 10K swim at the end of September. As I didn't end up using any of these things, I brought the merchandise back without tags and without the receipt, and they still let me have store credit after a sensible round of questions.With the store credit, I bought a much needed exercise ball. Though there were only a few alternatives, a nice lady tolerated my ceaseless questions about which one was better (as if I'd use the damn thing to bust my flubby gut). I also got a ton of nouveau running socks for my psycho marathon running sister.The NYC markup does apply here, but it's not as severe as it seems to be in other stores. Also, there were tons of rotating sales around, and that was great to see.When there was slight confusion at the register, a young, curly haired man in a flannel shirt stepped in, fixed things, smiled, nodded, and went away. A female cashier put her hand over her chest and said to her coworker, ""You know that was the owner, right?"" So this is apparently a family owned operation, and I was there to witness the hands on benefits of that fact in a city that can often be commercial and impersonal in its industries. This will be my go to stop if I'm stuck in the city and need something general or particular pertaining to sports, personal fitness, or the great outdoors.",9,0.9943

It may be in a hotel, but this the Upper East Side, not times Square or Central Park South, so this place is not littered with tourists. The entrance is an unassuming door off the lobby.

While waiting to be seated, we were rubbing shoulders with a lovely father-daughter (hopefully) duo in the crowd. They gushed about the food and recommended the cod. Once we were seated, the insanely knowledgeable waitress who knew about everything on the menu and can give you a spot-on, mouthwatering description on command rattled off the poetic specials of the day. We asked for recommendations for wine and she suggested one that was dry, mineraly, and just a hint of grapes (though her words were better than mine). Of the dishes we ordered, there were many winners. The fluke roll (one of the special appetizers of the evening) was quite possibly the best cousin-'o-sushi I have had in New York. Thin pieces of fluke wrapped around avacado and rice floating in a lovely soy-based sauce. My entree was simply Ah-mazing. I listened to the gentelman and ordered the truffle crusted cod with mushroom ravioli on a bed of spinach and truffle sauce. Yes, truffles are in there twice. I had dreams of bathing in this sauce using the snorkel as a straw rather than a breathing apparatus. The cod was so flaky and wonderful that all other cod that have come before and will come after will fall short in some way.Writing this review has made me long to go back and pull up a seat at the bar and order oyster after oyster from the seemingly endless list.

How do you order? What is everything? What does this ice cream look like? Is what I am ordering gay enough?I'm a late bloomer to the Big Gay Ice Cream world. I was also surprised to find that the BGICS used to be the juice/smoothie shop Xoom. Well whatever, places close in NYC every day. And I love what the Gays did to the place. *throws fairy dust in the air* It's fabulous!I thought about what I would like on my ice cream cone. Crushed Nilla wafers. Chocolate. My inner anxieties took over. Was that gay enough? It just didn't sound gay enough.So I went with the Salty Pimp, one of the signature items of BG, rather than making my own concoction. Vanilla ice cream, Dulce de Leche, chocolate dipped, and sea salt. WOWZERS! ZING! Oh man. It was good. First of all, the chocolate dipped cone was hard. Automatic win. It reminded me of the hard shell chocolate I used to eat as a kid. That topping was a special treat. The Dulce de Leche was sweet and the invisible sea salt really made the flavors come all together and pop. I would have never thought of sprinkling salt on ice cream, but like on chocolate- a little bit works wonders. I think the salt really was the key ingredient here. As for the ice cream, it really is nothing special. It's mediocre Mr. Softee stuff. But with all the toppings and makeover Mr Softee goes from zero to hero here.SWOON!My friend, who at first said no to the gayness, gave in and got the Mermaid. Vanilla ice cream, Key Lime curd, graham crackers, and whipped cream. We were immediately hypnotized by Splash and gobbled it up. What's not to like about tartness and a little whip? The sundae reminded me of Steve's Key Lime pies in Red Hook. -note to self: must make a trip out to BK soon-I switched back from stealing spoonfuls of my friend's sundae to sucking the ice cream out of my leaky cone. It's okay to eat a little risque at BGICS. They are all fun, games, and innuendo. Hell, some people have said the ice cream is just a tad short of being orgasmic.

I literally have a breakdown and start telling you how wrong you are. I would rather be in a speakeasy than any other type of bar in this great city.So it's really no surprise that when my friend Lea B. said I had to try this secret bar that just opened up in Chelsea, I obviously cancelled everything on my calendar and went immediately. You are probably now thinking that I am some sort of lush, that my life revolves around perfect cocktails and hidden joints. Not so. I just appreciate the secrecy of the space and if a master mixologist makes me a drink, I am not going to turn it down. So last night, as I was standing outside the coffee shop that is the front for this bar, I got all giddy with excitement. What would I find inside? Would it be big? Small? Dimly lit? Music? Bathtubs for tables? After locating the not-so-secret door, I entered and it was pretty typical speakeasy style set up. My heart still fluttered slightly and we were instantly greeted by the owner, David, who sat us at a cozy table for three. We perused the menu that boasted many gin drinks but also whiskey, tequila and bourbon concoctions, which made me happy since gin and I don't really get along so well. And there was a food menu. Nothing crazy, but pretty substantial for a secret spot like this. Good thing we were starving and couldn't wait to get our hands on some grub. We immediately ordered the lamb chops, which came coated in homemade tzatziki sauce and I don't know about you but one of my great loves in life are both lamb and tzatziki, and when put together, my head explodes from happiness. These miniature lamb chops slid right off the bone and were perfectly cooked. The sauce was clearly fresh and made that day. Since I don't do one of anything and always dine big, we also ordered the mushroom gnocchi, which was delicious and a small portion, which is good since I have absolutely zero self control and would have eaten an entire full sized portion and then felt sick afterwards. Smart little bar. We also tried out their herb fries with black truffle aioli, and I really couldn't get enough of that. That aioli was incredible. We wound up ordering another serving. I know, I know, one should never pig out while sipping their $14 cocktail, but I literally couldn't help myself. Luckily, my friends are foodie fiends too, and chowed down just as hard. Oh are you wondering about my drink? Are you thinking I'm an animal? That's okay with me. I ordered some sort of bourbon-ginger-cinnamon-goodness in a class with a wedge of orange and some oversized ice cubs. I told the waitress I wanted bourbon and wintery flavors and the bartender mixed me up something fierce. Do you want to hear about the decor? No? Well I don't much care, I'm going to tell you anyway. Gorgeous upholstered walls with a baroque pattern, vintage chandeliers and chairs and couches, nooks and crannies everywhere for hiding out...or making out. Everything was dark green and sexy...just the way I like it. The bathrooms were even fun with oversized copper tub-like sinks. The music playing was right out of the 1920's...or Boardwalk Empire. As I am sitting there, totally full and happy as a clam, I notice there is a gigantic copper vintage bathtub, just chilling out in the middle of the floor. When the owner walked by again, I asked him if he would potentially allow us to get in there and take photos. His response? ""I would highly encourage it."" To state the obvious, I will be back.

1378,24,12,5.0,"Chinese film auteur Wong Kar-wai's first English-language movie, My Blueberry Nights, received generally poor notices. Most reviewers, used to expecting transcendence from his films, frowned at the stilted dialogue and thin plot, then went right back to loving his Chinese work. But one critic brought up an intriguing, unsettling point: if you really sat down with them, didn't ALL his movies have those very same flaws? Was it just the buffer of them being in a foreign language that had allowed so many cinephiles to blindly worship at the temple of Kar-wai?A complicated issue, and one that flitted through my mind as the first of seven courses at Kajitsu was placed in front of my convive and me. Our server introduced the ""terrine of autumn vegetables"" by stating that Chef Nishihara meant the rectangular prism to evoke the foliage of Japan at this time of year. The server pointed out that one end (the South) was still pleasantly green, as represented on the plate by okra and broccoli, and the other end (the North) was flush with the crimsons and golds of the leaves turning color, as simulated by carrots, beets, et al.In virtually any other restaurant, I'd have rolled my eyes at what I might've taken to be heavy-handed symbolism. But through a myriad of tiny details of decor and of service, Kajitsu creates such an enveloping atmosphere of having entered another universe that I was willing to go with it. This was when Wong Kar-wai flashed through my brain: was I merely being deceived by the hype, the two Michelin stars, my Japanophilia? Was I forgiving Kajitsu its foibles because it cloaked them in otherworldliness?Then I took the dish on its own terms. I traced from south to north, incising the clear agar in which the strata of vegetation had been set. I moved through the gentle gradations of flavor, of crispness and startling lucidity, and found myself wholly transported into Nishihara's world after all.Let's be clear: that world is not Japan proper! I doubt the literalness of that first course would've flown in the subtle food culture there. And when I was blown away by shojin ryori at a temple in Kyoto itself, I never, NEVER thought it could be transplanted here. It can't. But what Nishihara achieves is something arguably even finer than slavish authenticity to a native template: he fits Japanese shojin-ryori Buddhist temple cuisine into a NYC idiom. By weaving in NY-local seasonal ingredients and ever-so-slightly nontraditional techniques, he acts like a translator of poetry, leaving traces of his own voice on the original, gorgeous framework.Maitake mushrooms -- native to Japan but also to the eastern U.S. -- played a role in multiple dishes, taking center stage in a light tempura crust as it perched on a wheel of tender eggplant above a deeply earthy red miso soup. It was more supporting, but no less striking, in croquette form next to fried nama-fu and sensitively grilled vegetables. (My convive's eyes snapped open at the burst of flavor that two tiny tomatoes on the plate brought.) A simple bowl of steamed kabocha, mustard greens, and taro root made no bid for attention but earned it all the same. Home-made udon with a sesame dipping sauce flecked with shiso and shichimi? Exquisite. So was the hijiki-laced rice bowl that provided a traditional end to the meal, along with tsukemono that spanned the gamut from subtly vinegared cucumber to resonantly piquant kelp.I circle back to Wong Kar-wai: even if you clash with the filmmaker's aesthetic, you cannot credibly argue with the force of his thematic convictions. So it is at Kajitsu. Chef Nishihara's physical hand is behind each dish, true, but it is his metaphorical hand, guiding each meal through its exhilarating yet smooth abstract narrative, that really carries the day. If anyone needed proof that peacefulness does not preclude passion, that reaching for formal perfection does not prevent individuality from shining through all the more brightly, or for that matter that vegan cuisine can excite beyond belief, then Kajitsu will serve as all the anecdotal evidence one needs. Bewitched and blinded by Oriental otherness, you accuse? Fine. Stick to Lupa, Raoul's, Gramercy Tavern. You'll have a good meal. When you're ready for it, Kajitsu will welcome you.

1379,14,9,5.0,"Definitely one of Bushwick's FINEST places...I've been hearing lots of good things about this place and I was really psyched that I finally got to try it. With a wonderful group of friends of course. Well It's starting to get pretty cold out, During the cold season, seeing this place from the outside it looks like someones garage that's been boarded up. Don't let this place fool you. Behind those wooden doors lies a place that your taste buds will thank you later for.I was here with a big group of people for a special tasting. We celebrated a birthday and the chef prepared a NINE COURSE tasting especially for us.... yeah we dat fancy!The menu (please refer to photos):Tofu & Squash Salad- The texture of this dish is amazing. You have the creaminess of the tofu which has a cream cheese like texture. Thew squash has the great bite to it. Nice and fresh. It's accompanied by grape tomatoes, olives, and lettuce.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZrzS… Pork Betty w/ Wasabi Cream Sauce-The meat just melts in your mouth. It's cut real thins so it's not too rich with each bit. At the end you are left with the sauce on the plate. If I had rice I would dump it on and soak up all that nice sauce... yelp.com/biz_photos/ZrzS…Sashimi & Nigiri-Some of the freshest cuts of fish i've had in awhile. It was so good that no soy sauce was even needed. It's served on a bed of stringed radishes. This was served with freshly graded wasabi. It doesn't get any fresher than this!yelp.com/biz_photos/ZrzS…Persimmon, Beet & Mushroom Tempura-This was a very good surprise. I thought I was eating butternut squash, but it was persimmon. It went very well with the batter and salt. Sweet and salty at the same time. The salt is very special. It's a special Green Tea infused salt that completes the dish. Definitely something to get again!yelp.com/biz_photos/ZrzS…Lionfish w/ Finger Limes-These animals are a thing of beauty. One of the most beautiful fishes in the ocean. Also rare and very tasty. This was freshly prepared sushi style with a special treat on top, Finger Limes. If you have never had finger limes you are missing out. These are little ""caviar like"" pieces of lime that burst with flavor. This is also suggested to be eaten by itself or with little soy sauce.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZrzS…Prawn Sushi-We were told to eat this with very little or no soy sauce. You really taste the flavor of the prawn with a slight hint of the fresh wasabi that's lightly spreaded between the prawn rice/yelp.com/biz_photos/ZrzS…Sushi Bombs-This wasn't only a treat for the tongue, but for the eyes as well. I have never seen something like this before. This was a fresh tuna roll with cucumber, spicy mayo with a scoopful of crisp rice on top. You have a whole lot of textures going on here. It's amazing! yelp.com/biz_photos/ZrzS…Fried Chicken-The fried chicken here is tasty. It's boneless chicken pieces with a ponzu dipping sauce. Everybody loves fried chicken right?yelp.com/biz_photos/ZrzS…Pork Chops w/ Apples & Pears-This was a mouthful... You get a thick cut of pork perfectly cooked and seasoned with a side of apples and pears cooked with onions. It's a bit sweet so it goes very well with the pork. yelp.com/biz_photos/ZrzS…Tips:CASH ONLYNO reservations*Make sure to securely lock the bathroom doors. It's a Japanese style sliding door and I did walk in on a nice young lady doing her business. We just laughed it off...The ambiance of the place is really relaxing and romantic. It's dimly lit so you can actually talk and look into your dates eyes. All in all it was a very good experience. This definitely won't be the last time I will be there.",19,0.9991

I don't know what is in the cocktail, ""The Freeman"", but it is fantastic as well. 4.) I LOVE my friends on the waitstaff.

1381,14,8,5.0,"Thanks for the great find, Yelpers! Anytime my mom comes to visit me, we always get Taiwanese food. Up until recently, we were just barely satisfied with the restaurants we frequented in the Bay Area; we had to lower our standards a bit and settle for mediocre food.We were not expecting much when we walked into this hole in the wall, so we were more than pleasantly surprised at the generous portions and delicious food.They offer the gamut of typical Taiwanese fare and the two of us went to town. We ordered oyster pancake (o-wa-zen), fried rice vermicelli (mi fen), clam soup, dry sauteed green beans, red chili oil wontons, and stewed fatty ground pork over rice (ask for more sauce, less oil, more meat). Everything was top notch. Oysters were plentiful (I think 5 total) and the somewhat chewy, eggy, glutinous texture of the egg and rice flour pancake smothered in sweet sauce was spot on. The clam soup was perfect: generous amount of clams in a light, clear broth. Sprinkle some white pepper and enjoy. I loved the red chili oil wontons (10 total)...delicious little pork dumplings nestled under bright red chili oil and topped with enough garlic to make gargling with Listerine 3 times a necessity. Yum. All 6 dishes were $30 inc. tax.The food was probably the one of the best I've had outside of Taiwan. My mom was so delighted with our meal, she wanted to go back 2 days later to take my dad and boyfriend just so we could order more things. The 4 of us made the 1 hour trek out to Flushing again and ordered 10 dishes: intestine with pork blood in brown sauce, fatty ground pork over rice, rice noodle vermicelli, fried fish fillet with spicy bean sauce, fresh stir fried veggies, stir fried jalapenos and beef, beef noodle soup, oyster pancake, clam soup and red chili oil wontons. $60. All worth it. We were stuffed, and had a ton of leftovers (all of which tasted just as good the day after).Fresh, good quality, great quantity, and extremely reasonable. Fast and friendly service.

1385,39,34,5.0,"So, is this what I've been waiting for all these years?Those were my thoughts as I opened the door. It was 11:50 am and there were 41 people ahead of me in the line waiting patiently. There was no bouncer at the door to remind one of the tacky experience of buying cupcakes of quality that would make one weep more than by watching Steel Magnolias. It did make me smile. After more than four and a half years of reviewing macarons (including 2+ years of clarifying to people the difference between macarons and coconut macaroons!) and flying in macarons from across the country and across the Atlantic all the while watching multiple generations of Magnolia clones, bankers turned bakers and corner delis sporting large cardboard signs screaming CUPCAKES (next to those for phone cards) mint money from Freudian psychology- finally the day had come that there were more customers waiting in line at a shop selling macarons than at the flagship locations of Magnolia, Crumbs, Molly's, and Baked by Melissa COMBINED.... Yes: I went around to compare. It generated more adrenalin than a victory lap.I must also confess upfront that I am slightly biased against Laduree, and am in the Pierre Herme camp. This is mainly a result of my conviction that Laduree lags Pierre Herme (and others) in most pastries, and even croissants (I mean seriously, have you had the Ispahan croissant? Now that takes baking to the level of an art!). That should not detract from the fact that Laduree makes outstanding macarons, arguably ""the best"". However, I find it simplistic to say ""best"", for any top tier patisserie in Paris makes excellent macarons and on any given day Sadaharu Aoki, Dalloyau, even Jean Paul Hevin (and others) - not just Pierre Herme can compete with Laduree for top honors. While there may be production variability by day, there is also overall consistency by flavor/design, and so I would similarly be hard pressed to find anyone other than Laduree making my favorite versions of Cassis or Orange Blossom (Fleur de Oranger). There can be no doubt on the quality of the macarons in the NYC shop, for they are flown in, and the only question is as to how they've handled the transatlantic travel. While I don't understand the assertion that they are flown in fresh daily (they don't need to / can't be fresh off the oven, nor do economics justify anything more frequent than a weekly flight, as is the case with LMDC) - I have limited issues with the NYC ones aesthetically or texturally. Though, I did find the jam ones (Raspberry, Strawberry) somewhat of a softer texture than the others (also a complaint in prior reviews), but they held up fairly well to the bite test. Obviously, once local baking in NYC commences, it would be time for a review update. But for now, I am thrilled that Laduree has arrived. At $ 2.70 for a small macaron these may be pricier than what you'd find at say a Little Oven, but for the price point I find them infinitely superior to the B of FP at Ho.Service is courteous and efficient. I was greeted at 12:20 pm by a server who wanted to know the details of my purchase. I paid and left at 12:35 pm, and the 45 minute door-to-door has been the average wait time earlier as well. My heart did go out to the distinguished, graceful elderly lady who left after waiting 15 minutes while politely wishing us well. I tried to while away the time first by reading and then by engaging the attractive girl behind me in a conversation. But, upon finding out that she didn't like macarons, and was only there to help out colleagues, the conversation just died. I mean, WHAT could I possibly have in common with someone who doesn't like macarons? Really! J/KWith another Laduree outlet expected to open in Soho in Spring 2012, the only real question left is: what are YOU waiting for, Monsieur Herme?",45,0.9901

I've been raving about the awesome Sunburnt Cow in the LES for years but couldn't convince them to schlep their arses to the City to enjoy the treasure. Again, the food god answered my prayers in the form of one of the new deities; the Calf. I've said it once and I'll say it again; I'm a lover of bottomless mimosas. Besides trying to do good in the world, I also spend much of my time trying to find the best unlimited mimosa spot and I think my journey may have ended. Just maybe.The Calf is a small joint so expect a wait to get seated; however you can order your drinks from the bar while you wait. I peaked out back and come next Spring it looks like there will be outdoor seating with an outside bar. Sweet! There is so much goodness in this place that it must be chronicled in a time line:1st minute in: Sister is greeted by Jackie, the manager who remembered her from the previous night's dinner and remembered it was her birthday15 minutes: Drinks in hand, chatting it up and waiting to be seating. Stare longingly in the kitchen at all the goodness being prepared30 minutes: Super cute/ fun bartender jokes around and asks if we want to stand around all day. We sheepishly say no and prance over, tipsy off the strong mimosas (Score!)45 minutes: We are happy to be alive and drinking, and drinking more, oh and now we must order food. 1 hr: Orders in, gals are smiling like the Cheshire cat because the waiters understand our thirst for the Vitamin Champagne. These folks KNOW the true meaning of bottomless mimosa.1 hr 5 minutes: A potential sexual harassment suit may occur after friend asks waiter his name. It's Angus. She makes some inappropriate joke about his beef. Said waiter turns beet red, pours more mimosas and skips off.1 hr 10 minutes: Speaking of beets our big ass burgers come piled high with a fried egg, beets, pineapple, onions, lettuce and tomato. Others have the Barramundi with Vermicelli Noodles and Rice Bowl1 hr 11 minutes: Friend frowns a little at egg that she asked to be prepared non-runny and best waitress/manager alive Jackie, swoops over out of the blue and takes it back. 1hr 45 minutes: Good mimosas flowing like Cristal in a bad rap video. Friend finds a hair in her devoured burger. Waiter (on his freakin' lunch break) swoops over and asks what's wrong. Other sober friends realize it's said friend's own hair. Said friend needs to slow down.2 hrs: Cupcakes and candle come out for sissie's birthday. Jackie, you really outdid yourself! 2 hrs 30 minutes: Very full, very tipsy.

There had to be about 16 or 20 of those little suckers which would be generous even by dinner portion standards. No puny, little wanna-be clams either. I'm talking meaty, ""I've been taking steroids"" kinda clams.

The line really wasn't too bad though, we were in within 20 minutes.The place was mildly packed at 11:30, and I guess I understand why the bouncers forced ppl to wait outside, because it made the place more spacious and there was actually room to reach the bar & get my dance moves on!We danced ALLLLL NIGHT LONG and while there are a bunch of other things for non-dancers to do like pool tables, foozball, jenga, make out/dry hump each other by the giant horse in the back corner, my friends and I were too busy shakin' our stuff!There's also free coatcheck!

A 100 year old institution, Barney Greengrass is the place grandfathers take their grandkids for meals on weekends, to introduce them to all manner of smoky fish and salty meats, to devour rugelach and chocolate babka, and to learn how to pronounce it all correctly. The front is mostly for take-out purchases, although has a few tables for overflow; the back room, preserved in time for grandchildren to admire, is the restaurant proper, covered in horse-and-wagon wallpaper which is somehow charming (even though it's green). The space isn't large and the tables are pretty close, so be prepared for long waits on weekends and to inadvertently overhear all conversations at neighboring tables no matter when you show up.The dishes aren't cheap, but they are Worth It. My recommendation is to go with ""Barney's Specialties:"" the eggs with nova and onions, which comes with a bagel & cream cheese, cannot be beat, and you can't find a better pastrami and eggs anywhere in NYC. If none of the specialties appeal to you, hit the 3-decker sandwiches - but be prepared to be unable to finish them! And you cannot leave without having a black and white cookie.

It's 1 avenue block wide and about 12 streets in length. That may not sound very large at all, but in this neighborhood, it's a good amount of space and it's beautifully laid out (Thank you NYC Parks Dept!)You can chose to run on the bordering sidewalks, on the paved trail (which includes a few small hills), or go on the track (1/4 mile loop). During the summer, some friends played tennis here. We also came quite a few times to lay out in the sun. You can sunbathe here and no one will bother you! It's really convenient because there's no sand and no traffic to put up with.In the fall, I come to run and watch the local HS football play in the middle of the track.They also hold special events and charities here.

With that said, ""Yemen Cuisine,"" in the vein of other creatively named restaurants like ""American Chinese Restaurant,"" or ""Lee's Buffet,"" is not a looker by any means.

1397,27,15,5.0,"It's about time that the far Upper East Side where East Harlem meets starts getting spots like this that you would normally find only downtown. Earl's Beer & Cheese is located in a pretty vacant stretch along Park Ave and 97th where the train overpass meets the tunnel underground. Not much of a view but who cares when all you need to look at are your terrific beers and wonderful cheese plates.As others here have mentioned the place is insanely tiny. Personally, that does not bother me as long as I can grab a seat or spot to enjoy my brew. For others I can see where they would become claustrophobic quickly. When we arrived here around 6PM on Saturday there were only around eight people there, but by 7PM I had counted around 25 and it was jammed packed. This place has become popular very quickly in this neck of the woods, and for good reason.Basically, it is one long communal table that seats 8-10 people. A small counter with a few stools looks out the front, and there is another narrow counter along the wall to stand at. Really, before we left a few hours later there still must have been close to 25 people in there and it was rocking. They were playing a cool mix of 80's rock and I remember hearing The Cars and The Police playing a lot. Also, it can get a bit warm in here but they had the whole front open letting in a nice evening breeze. The place resembles a faux hunting lodge with mounted deer heads on the walls, murals of deer in the woods, and a bathroom that looks like you are in a wooden shed. The menu features some creative takes on cheese. We had the Beer Cheese which was terrific. Comes in basket of bread that is presented as toast points buttered on each side. So airy and crispy. You get a good amount of spreadable cheddar beer cheese, and a tin with garlic cloves too. Yummy, yum, yum!Mmmmm......Beer Cheese. Just thinking about it is making me drool.There are other plates such as a cheese board, grilled cheese sandwiches, Asian Gnocchi & Beef, Mac & Cheese, a gourmet Eggo waffle with foie gras, cheddar, and coffee-cured bacon, among a few other items to choose from. From what we tried, and talking to the people around us eating, everything here is on-point. Just order at the bar and the staff will bring it over to you. Accepts credit cards too and everything here is pretty cheap overall. Can I mention the beer selection? I was pleasantly surprised at the craft beer options on tap and in cans. Draft beers served in glass mugs go for $5 - $6, and canned beers run $3-$8. They even have Growlers To Go - $19 Refills / $4 for a Growler. The four line beer selection rotates and they bring in different brews constantly. Autumnation in cans, Victory Pilsner on tap, and Troegs Stout on tap were just a few that we enjoyed. They pair exceptionally well with the cheese plate selections here.Personally, I love a small place like this that serves the local community. Saw a mix of younger newbies and older stalwarts of the area in here. There was even a group of older ladies visiting from Poland that came in to down a few pints next to us and then head out. It was too funny. Again, this small place is probably not for everyone, especially if you can't deal with crowds and being squished next to other patrons. I guess it also depends on what time you go as I heard that right after work hours / early evening is very busy. Still, this has become a new favorite of mine in my hood. So glad it is not downtown or in Brooklyn, as it is only a few minutes walk from where I live.

He's opening another 089 location in Manhattan eventually, but I believe in always trying the original. Finally I got to try 089, and it definitely lived up to the billing!First thing you notice here is the amount of work they did to make this place look like its smack dab in the middle of some Campanian village. From the texture on the walls, to the skylight, to the oven, if this place doesn't transport you to Italy nothing will. The service is very professional, and as hard as I am on servers I found absolutely no fault with them. Thats a festivus miracle in itself. And smack dab in the middle of the restaurant was the most important thing: Roberto Paciullo. He wasn't barking out orders or anything, just sitting and having lunch with a friend. His presence alone was enough to ensure that everyone was on their game. Thats great leadership, and exactly what it takes to make a great restaurant one of the best in the city.Since the first time was only lunch, I just got pizza although the rest of the menu made me think twice. The bread they brought out as well was a great variety, and looked to be from Madonia but could've been from a few different places as there were several kinds. The pizza I got was the Riccardo, which had buttersquash puree along with smoked mozzarella, spicy pancetta, and basil. The crust could've used more char, but was pillowy soft and had a nicely risen lip all around. I was actually expecting something more crisp and with less of a lip as this is Salerno-style pizza, but this worked just fined. While the crust was great, it was outshined by everything else. Simply put, this combo WORKED. The pancetta was the fatty kind they serve in Italy, broken into bits and with a subtle little bit of heat as promised. This contrasted with the smoked mozzarella from Casa della Mozzarella around the block, which was bursting with milky smokiness. Combined with the sweetness of the squash, every bite was bursting with flavor. The only change I would make would be to add a bit more basil, as it acted as a wonderful balancing agent that brought all the different flavors together. All in all, one of the best pizzas I've had, and thats saying something at this point. The next time I came back for the normal menu with a group of 6. For starters we had the zuppa di vongole and the calamari alla peperonata. Both were pefectly executed, with the sweet, tiny clams being the standout for me; the calamari was also perfectly cooked, with the flavor of the peppers standing out in particular. We decided to get a bottle of wine, and our server was extremely helpful in selecting one that worked with all of our dishes (a reasonably priced Super Tuscan). For my main, I got the Linguini al Nero di Seppia e Calamari, which is their homemade linguini in a black squid ink sauce with calamari and cuttlefish thrown in the mix. It was awesome. The flavor of the tomatoes wasn't lost and the squid ink wasn't overpowering--two common issues with this dish. The homemade linguini was a perfect al dente as well. Once again, the calamari here was perfectly cooked, and the cuttlefish--which feels halfway between octopi and calamari--was too. This was food exactly as it is in the south of Italy. Fresh, simple and straight forward.  Also, when we were leaving one of my friends left something behind and the waiter ran out after us to make sure the schmuck didn't forget it. From the appetizers to the service to the espresso we had at the end, this place was remarkably consistent in how great it was.At this point, if you're interested in Italian food, you've probably heard of Arthur Ave already. If you haven't gone already, you're probably looking for an excuse. The restaurants around here can be a mixed bag, but you'd be hard pressed to go wrong with this place. One weekend, go to the Bronx Zoo for a few hours, use the Southern Blvd exit, walk north a bit and turn onto 187th, and walk over to the neighborhood. Retail Market, bread bakery, meat market, cheese shop, pasta shop, eat some clams on the side walk at a seafood market, and this place. If that isn't a good day, then what the hell is?",17,0.9991

I'm a weekend warrior, so I rarely get to experience happy hour specials. anywho, I rolled in here at 10:30 and drinks seemed to get cheaper as the night progressed. at some point I paid 7 dollars for a Stella and Jameson shot. the bartenders were freaking incredible (one is the guitarist from God Forbid), friendly and fast slinging the drinks.second: the atmosphere. despite our grizzled and frightening appearance, metalheads are probably the friendliest people you'll ever meet. music was roaring, people were talking, and I even mingled my way into playing a game with some regulars...it involved spinning a wheel of numbers, and slapping each other across the face. aaaand there was 70s porn playing on some TVs. aaaaand tons of memorabilia of metal bands and classic horror movies.third: LIVE BANDS! they were playing mostly covers from what we heard - heard a lot of Slayer and Pantera. then, at one point, Jimmy Duff was strolling around (sidenote: the guy is one of the friendliest, coolest people on the planet! you rule!) and said ""they're stuck in traffic, but Machine Head is on their way to play a suprise set"".

I must re-iterate though, you must have patience to go through all the bins, I guarantee if you give it a chance you will fall in love instantly with this place as well. I've left this place with 10lbs worth of goodies and only paid a measley $12 bucks. I can't argue with that at all.

However, if you think I'm all Astor Room'ed out, you are sadly mistaken, my friends. I will come here time and time and time again, because dang, Astor Room makes you a lusty promise, and then delivers! I don't know many men who can please 13 women simultaneously, do you? Intrigued? Read on!The cocktails menu will make you swoon, as long as you're not a PBR drinker (and if you are, well, stop reading now). Delicately made, delicious to the sip, and packing a punch, you basically can't go wrong. For brunch, the bloody mary has a nice balance of heat and flavor, and I didn't hear a single complaint about the mimosas.Foodwise, anything involving the short ribs is a clear winner. I wanted to get the Maryland Crab Melt for my entree, sadly, it had sold out. that'll teach me to sleep in on a Sunday, though, so next time! Instead, I went with the Astor Disaster, cos I'm a gal that likes variety (although I skipped the bacon). French toast topped with cheese, eggs any way you like, onion rings, short rib, and a side of potatoes? Yes please! Overall, a winner. The donut holes are epic as well, and great to share with a group. I particularly appreciated the three different jams/cream you can choose to dollop on, making every bite an additional exercise in culinary variety.Every time I have come here, there's been some sort of live music, which is a great touch for ambiance.

I was feeling a wee bit woozy and my body was wrecked after three weeks of keeping my ass in line at the gym. I was struck by how cute and clean and efficient everything was inside. It was busy, but all the staff was bustling about and no one seemed to wait long. Sally took me back to my small, dark, candlelit room smelling of delicious aromatherapy and instructed me to take everything off but my underwear. I giggled and told her I wasn't wearing any and, not fazed in the slightest, she told me to just get comfy under the towel. Sally. Is. Amazing. If I wasn't too busy drooling through the face-hole in the table, I would have dropped right down on one knee and proposed to her and her miracle working hands. She asked how I liked my massages and I told her pretty hard, but she laughed and said she'd start medium because sometimes people cried when she went full-force. My advice is this: trust the woman. She has a LOT of power packed into that tiny body and she worked into every knot in my back and tushie (I LOVE when they massage my tushie!) over and over again. We moved onto the facial and it was equally fab. Everything smelled delightful and her hands went seamlessly from insanely gentle around my eyes to the perfect pressure on my head and temples. She started with a cleanser, then steamed my face for a good couple of minutes, and then...came the extractions. I felt like my face was being sliced open, but I can't fault her for that because I always want to cry like a bitch during this part of facials. So much so that today, while involuntary tears fell down the sides of my face, I wondered how I would ever endure the pain of childbirth. Ah well. That's a discussion for another day. She finished with exfoliation and a hydrating mask. It felt so good that I dozed off. You guys! My skin looked immediately better. Luminous and clean and tight tight tight. All this despite the fact that those extractions left me sure that my face was bleeding and mangled.I HIGHLY recommend Sally and Blossom. I can't wait to come back!",16,0.9975

What I received was a foot long, 6 inch wide vessel of sliced beef, molten cheese & grilled onions - smothered with what looked to be the skimmed refuse from the Deepwater Horizon.It was a big, gooey, dripping mass of mess and already oozing everywhere before getting it to the table. But once I folded it shut and took a bite, I was in sandwich nirvana. Usually with a sandwich this size, I'd save half for lunch the next day, but given the glorious goop nature of this beast, I ate most of it in one sitting, which I thought was quite an accomplishment. Then some skinny dude sits down at the next table with a sandwich that was about 3-feet long. Seriously.  Warning: Do not order here if you are wearing nice clothes, are on a first date, or generally eat finger foods with a knife and fork. There will be blood. Only not real blood, but their crazy gravy which redefines previous notions of viscosity.Also of note: The great Brooklyn staff, cussing up a storm about football. The walls adorned with autographed photos of Italian actors/sportsman, plus scenes of old Brooklyn and older Italy. Sadly you'll probably not get to experience the crazy customer who entertained me - an Italian American ""My Cousin Vinny"" type who was arguing with her soon-to-be-ex over the phone and describing where she was going to shove her new license plates.

And everything is in perfect balance, there's just the right amount of sauce and crab and pork and veggies for the noodles. It is a model dry noodle dish, never greasy or heavy.Get yourself some snacks too, to whet your appetite. There's these tasty spareribs (FYI, if you're gonna share snacks? You have to get two, because one order at lunchtime is literally one rib, which is a little intimate), spicy, tender calamari, crisp and refreshing papaya salad. There's a spicy beef salad that really is spicy, but you will order a jug of the very well made Thai iced tea to wash it down.All of the other noodle dishes are also very, very well done- excellent textures, excellent sauces/broths.

I had been with so many great bagel places before, and you came off as really flaky - one day I got a warm bagel, one day I got a cold bagel....one time, I even asked you specifically if your everything bagels were hot, you told me yes, and then the one I got was cold and hard as a rock! I didn't think you cared about me, and that hurt my feelings.Well, I don't know what happened, but the last few months have really been magical. After such a rocky start, you've been so generous to me ever since! Every time I arrive, a smoking hot everything bagel, waiting there, just for me! So perfectly dense! Such a crunchy outside! Just chewy enough to make you put in a little bit of effort to eat it, but not so much so that it hurts your jaw! The ultimate subtle sweetness that I have been searching for in a bagel all my life! My faith hath been restored!And I thought it was important to let you know that even through the worst of times, your spreads always kept me happy. Nobody - anywhere, ever - has come even close to your lox spread, and its generous chunks of salmon. And your whitefish salad and baked salmon salad may be the best shmears I've ever encountered - just salty enough, just smoky enough, and super-fresh. And even though I'm not really into all of those veggie and fruit cream cheeses that you seem to be so excited about, I might even be willing to give those a try for you if you keep being so good to me.And finally, I'm proud to keep standing by you in your battle against toasted bagels.

I made a quick visit to The Pickle Guys thinking that I would get really good pickles, but instead I got blown away by their pickles. They have several different kinds varying in sourness (quarter, half, three-quarters, and full) and different kinds (spicy, sweet), including different vegetables (different kinds of tomatoes, olives, carrots, onions, beans, turnips, etc) and seasonal varieties.The pickled pineapples fulfilled my unspoken and unknown pickle desires. They're the perfect balance of sweet, tart, and spicy. I kept popping one after another into my mouth until I puckered up. They're so addicting. The funny thing was that I was in line with no intention of getting them of as the people in front of me tasted them and said, ""Oh, they're really good. I'll get those too."" I also had to taste them. And then get them. And then based on my reactions, the people behind me also tasted and got them. And so forth. It was a domino chain reaction. They'll let you taste whichever pickles you want to taste and they're really patient with you, even if you behave like a silly little thing and change your mind a couple times.

1412,14,9,5.0,"Is there a more approachable, warm and amiable chef than Aaaron Sanchez?! I really can't think of any. Despite his fame being a judge on multiple Food Network shows such as, 'Chopped' which he also competed in during the all-stars tournament (he should have won btw), and ""Chef vs. City"", this second-generation Latino chef serves his heart on a plate. I've seen him since his days on ""Melting Pot"" and have always admired his passion, intensity, and overall humility. I decided I had to finally eat at one of his restaurants to really see if his talents matched his likeability. Those who are wondering, the answer is a resounding yes.Centrico has a great corner location, and the instant feel of the restaurant is lively and open. There is outdoor seating, which is perfect for warm weather, the bar scene is energetic, and the main dining area is spacious yet still intimate. If you're lucky, like we were, Chef Sanchez will be at the pass working his little fiery fingers expediting food to his guests. I could not resist the urge to tell him how much I loved him as we walked towards our table. He was so gracious about it and I knew at that moment that this was a great man. Now onto the scrumptious food...APPETIZERS:Guacamole & Chips -- the chunks of avocado were enormous in the wooden mortar and pestle container, and the tortilla chips were crunchy and fresh. Short Rib Croquetas -- braised short rib and smoky white beans, made for a very delicious starter. The meat was so tender and maintained a lot of flavor and juices within the perfectly fried outer shell.MAINS:Pollo con Mole -- pan roasted chicken, mole sanchez & wild mushrooms. This was the one entree that specifically had his name on it, which sealed my decision to go for it. The chicken was unbelievably moist and really took in the flavor of the sauce. Not sure what variety of mole was used, but it was well-bodied and had a mild creamy texture. The wild mushrooms were amazing. I had to share this dish b/c the portion was out-of-this-world. Pescado a la Veracruzano -- market fish, tomato, olive & serrano. The boyfriend's choice, which I actually ended up really enjoying, possibly more than the chicken dish. The fish was cooked to perfection, it was soft and flaky, and the lightness of the fresh fish was well-balanced against the acidity and heat from the tomato and serrano peppers. The added saltiness of the olives were fantastic. I could have eaten two servings of this dish. DESSERT:None. We did a little naughty and actually had ice cream before going to dinner. We were early for our rezzie, and decided to make a pit stop at my favorite ice cream shop, Lula's Apthoecary for a birthday cone for the boyfriend. When the waiter had asked us if we wanted to take a look at the dessert menu, we had to regretfully decline. This story leads into the highlight of our dining experience at Centrico. As we waited for our check, which, I felt was taking too long, lo and behold, Chef Sanchez comes out with a delicious chococlate cake -- candle-lit, I might add -- all for Jimmy's birthday. I had mentioned in passing that it was his special day when he came by to say hi and enabled my inner dork the chance for a photo-op with him. I was so grateful and thrilled just to hear him wish Jimmy a Happy Birthday, I had no idea he would show that level of kindness and personally bring him a gift. The dessert was on the house, but I was floored by his graciousness, and people around us were feeling the love, too. I had to show them my gratitude and tipped well over the going rate of 20%. And to be honest, service was in fact, great In the end, it was a very successful meal, hitting all the right marks. I felt transported and didn't mind that I had eated Mexican at least 3x during the week leading up to Centrico. It felt like a new experience altogeher. I thought to myself, as we left the restaurant, that not only is Aaron Sanchez a celebrity chef, but a very talented one at that, and he is also a genuine person. Mexican cuisine has been blessed with such a worthy and reputable ambassador in Aaron Sanchez, and his love and work ethic is embodied in Centrico and his on-going endeavors. Much love and success.

1414,11,14,5.0,"A Yelper had once asked me if I would I go to a park. I'm told the expression I gave him was priceless--a mixture of bafflement, confusion, and utter incomprehension. ""Why...would I go to a park?"" ""I don't know, to sit, walk, whatever."" ""I...don't understand."" Now, this was when I lived in Houston (oh so recently). There, going to the park means either sweating your balls off (find your own female equivalent--oh, fine, gonads) or having mosquitoes make a buffet of your succulent skin. As I prefer to maintain an air-conditioned glow, I am anti-park in Houston. In better climes, I don't mind parks. I will even like parks, such as this one, which, as of now, runs from W. 30th St. to Gansevoort St. (south of W. 12th). From 17th upwards, the entrances are a little to the west of 10th Ave. (identifiable by the flocks of people ascending metal stairs), and a little to the east from 17th downwards.The park is thin, since its basis is an old train line. Most parts has one-person (on each side) walking channels, with a few more open spots. The walkways/non-green areas are made of a pretty grey concrete. The more northern portions have more greenery, which can seem like weeds. My theory is that, in our Holy-Shit-The-Earth-Is-Warming-Up-Faster-Than-A-Hot-Pocket--Save-The-Earth! climate, this is a natural progression of the three R's. Oh, look, we have a lot of weeds. Insta-park! Further down, a little north of 14th, there are wooden, at-an-angle chairs to lounge in or get your tan on (hello, Scandinavian ass cheeks! nice to meet you) and a section where there's a shallow running stream of water to run around in. There's also a section of regular, upright wooden benches with backs. You'll find some random food vendors around (in this summery weather, artisan popsicles--yes, artisan frozen flavored water--gelato, ice cream, etc.), especially in the covered walkway around 16th. If you descend the stairs, there's an actual dining area and cafe of some sort. There's also an amphitheater where you can just see the street (glass is there, so the kiddos don't create some tragic play of their own). Around 30th on street-level are a skating rink (roller for now--think Boogie Nights, or not, if you have kids; $12 for adult rental), a dining area, a rotating list of trucks (sweet and salty), and (for now) some pop-up Uniqlo stores. Because nothing says park more than getting your retail on. I like The High Line so much, bought some vouchers for a boot camp there. I'm not sure how it's going to work, what with the lack of maneuverability with the skinniness of the park, but I'm looking forward to plowing through tourists on my way to an ice cream sandwich (I'm very goal-oriented).",12,0.8062

Admittedly, it's probably due in large part to the accents, but Jones Wood Foundry not only keeps it real with British barkeeps tending to their British themed bar, but they employ some hot Brits at that. I have been here twice now, both times for late night libations, and you know what? I had a fantastic experience. Friendly, engaging bartenders made me park my rump on the tiny couch area in the back of the bar for numerous hours, downing beer they picked for me and laughing the whole time. It sort of feels like home, uber comfortable, casual, a little bit sexy (my apartment is not sexy, regrettably) and very awesome. Are you sitting there adding this to your favorites yet? No? You really should.The first jaunt to JWF left me hanging out at the bar way past closing. Yeah, they were cool with that. The second excursion was for my friend Ali F.'s birthday party which I chose to throw there, since we enjoyed it so much the first time.

1417,33,24,5.0,"WELCOME to Manhattan's premiere high-brow tourist attraction.A single ticket runs for a cool $295; reservations are only accepted (and only ostensibly available) between 10AM and 10:09AM precisely thirty days prior to your desired dining date. Keller's New York lieutenant holds court at the head of the cool kids table - the 4th floor of the Columbus Circle shopping center.Mere mortals, when countered with doors, will perceive doors. Patrons of Per Se will wisely shun the stately cerulean gates (for they do not open), and enter through the modest glass postern.The food, on a standalone basis, was not meaningfully better than the (ginormously less expensive) usual suspects. There was lobster, foie gras, cavier, oysters, veal, duck. All the trendy, good, rich, French things.But the extra $200 DOES get you something - service that's personable, patient, and unpretentious, a tour of the kitchen and its assorted mementos, a photo op with the chef de cuisine, lots and lots of table and floor space to chat and FoodSpot, an unending parade of sweets, souvenir menus customized with your choice of headline, and no sense of shame about any of it, except possibly the 9 courses of French food.Per Se understands that you've chosen to dine there for a *very* special occasion, and that you will in all likelihood never return - for the rest of your life. They really endeavor (successfully) to make it a 'once-in-a-lifetime experience'. Our twenty-something server bantered very openly with us - about Rebecca Black, pets, bicycles, that article in the Times. He encouraged us to stuff the housemade caramels into our purses for later, and he happily offered to take our photo at many flattering angles, in Hipstamatic, with the chef, backed by Central Park, backed by our dessert smorgasbord, backed by each of the fine-dining-museum-artifacts sitting around the kitchen - Michelin stars, Per Se's first cheque, the two-way viewing screen hooked up to The French Laundry. We were given branded goody bags of (yet more) sweets, and our menus. The experience at large was therefore very robust, and robustly perfect. Be sure to go with friends with whom you can spend an unawkward 4-5 hours - this is a meal akin to a day spent together sightseeing or on a long scenic drive - slow, relaxed, intimate, and fun.",35,0.9928

Polish writing on stores, delis, bakeries and restaurants says it all... When you walk in Lomzynianka is dimly lit with pink and white flowered table clothes - what you'd expect in Eastern Europe (and reminiscent of my grandma's home).....Even the aroma of the place gets you hungry. The place seems to be family owned and run - the owner is the waiter and two older women work in the little kitchen cooking... When you first sit they bring you out a platter with various cole slaws (cabbage and carrot variations) - very good!What's even greater about this place is the prices - so cheap for such good quality food. To begin my friend and I each ordered the borscht - she ordered the white borscht soup which has pieces of what appear to be kielbasa (or someother type of sausage) and red borscht soup with vegetables - both were DELICIOUS!!! (and only $3 each).. The food tastes like home cooking and to be quite honest - the soups themselves are feeling enough to be your meal.After the soups we ordered the Polish platter (now $9) which comes with pierogies (cheese, potato, and vegetable), kielbasa (a bbq'd sausage), stuffed cabbage, bigos (a sorta vegetable beef stew mass), and mashed potatoes...EXCELLENT!!Really - the food here was incredible and felt like a very authentic atmosphere..

1419,37,19,5.0,"The last dinner I had during a vacation in Japan was at a tiny sushi bar deep in Tokyo's Roppongi district, hand-picked by the family of my cousin's Japanese wife. We were the only customers that night. The chef was an artist in continual motion, his raw material culled from Tsukiji Market mere hours before. His nigiri: poetry itself. Fireworks exploded behind my eyes the entire time, testament to the meal's stunning quality.Yet still, it could not erase Sushi Yasuda from my mind.Almost 30 years of eating memories I have built up, many of them in the NYC area. Countless exceptional moments. But no single restaurant meal has had more of an effect on me than the omakase I had from chef Yasuda-san himself in 2004. True, before then, programmed by my Filipino genes, I enjoyed eating immensely. But after the meal, food became the keenest of all my obsessions. That is what one perfect hour can do.In the seven years since, I'd been back to Yasuda but once, escorting one very special lady there for lunch in 2007. We didn't really talk about it afterwards -- my only clue to her opinion is that to this day her Yelp profile lists Sushi Yasuda as her designated ""last meal on Earth"".When I heard this past winter that Yasuda-san had decided to return to Japan, my breath caught in my throat. ""Sushi Yasuda"" would march on under a trusted lieutenant, but how could it ever be the same? I needed to know. I would give the sushiya several months to complete the transition. Then I would return to pit it against the virtually invincible fortress of my memories.Now: a beautiful summer day. Textured paper in the windows was new; otherwise, all was the same as four years prior. I sat at the counter. The young chef before me, Tatsuya Sekiguchi, gave me a plate with pickled ginger on it. I popped a slice in my mouth, just as a palate cleanser.And I realized instantly that I had made a mistake.Understand, everything at Yasuda is made from scratch, from the grated wasabi to the soy sauce. The ginger vanished on my tongue, releasing its crisp flavor like a water balloon popping. My God! Even the ginger was breathtaking!No wonder I'd been reluctant to return -- even my 2007 visit had been more of a lark than premeditation. The place was a temple to sushi, a sanctum sanctorum that should not be breached lightly. How had I forgotten? I wanted to get up, say, ""I'm sorry, I have to wait for a life-changing experience to come back, I don't deserve this right now,"" bow in deepest apology.But Tatsu-san smiled warmly at me, seeming to detect that amongst the businessmen and Japanese expats at the counter, I was the one who felt most privileged to be there. ""You have been here before?"" he said.""Not in years.""""I hope you enjoy.""It felt like an absolution. My panic subsided. I settled on a simple lunch special, carefully cross-referencing my choices for five nigiri pieces and two rolls with the several hand-marked chef's-picks for fish of the day. ""I can add a piece of kinmedai, right?"" I asked.Tatsu-san smiled again, this time with his eyes. ""Yes, yes!"" His youthful looks belied the brisk assurance of his movements. It seemed like only seconds passed before he was placing each delicate, glistening morsel in front of me. ""Fluke. Orata. Orange clam..."" I don't remember my exact order. It doesn't matter. When I put the first piece in my mouth, a cadence sounded in my head, and the world dissolved away.It was like some positive form of PTSD, my food life flashing before my eyes. Eating baconsilog at the kitchen table in my childhood home, tree-filtered sunlight angling into the room like a scene from a Malick film. Showing my college sweetheart how to squeeze every last drop of flavor out of a lobster, pleasure thrumming through every cubic centimeter of her being as she scooped at its head. Curating a co-workers' trip to Flushing, the joy of discovering xiao long bao flickering onto each of their faces like so many fireflies.When I came to, Tatsu-san was smiling at me yet again. ""Is it OK?"" he asked.You want evocations of the food itself? Forget it. That is beyond my ken. But know this: the ridiculous variety of fish is a red herring. Who chooses eateries by menu length? Even its freshness is beside the point. No, Sushi Yasuda's claim to the firmament is its incredible rice -- a thunderclap that has not lost a decibel in the absence of its founding chef. To order sashimi would be to forfeit a glimpse into eternity.Maybe this hasn't been much of a review, per se; maybe it's just me sobbing into my keyboard. But if you care about food... if you care about anything... before shuffling off this mortal coil you owe it to yourself to come here.Probability of return within 1 year, or 10: impossible to calculate. Come back after a ""life-changing experience""? Sushi Yasuda IS a life-changing experience. The next woman I bring there will be one I intend to spend the rest of my life with.",34,0.9986

It's kind of dingy.""That's okay. I'm there for the food not for the fact that it's on Open Table or is Michelin starred.A solo bearded man eats in the corner devouring his bowl of noodles, the group of women sit and make trays and trays of dumplings, old Chinese men gossip over dinner, a not so random group of food gluttons take over 5 tables... This is a typical scene at Sheng Wang. I'm not sure who is the loudest of all. Definitely not the solo bearded man but I can tell he wants to shout to the high Heavens how good his soup is.I love Sheng Wang. I dream of having a whole plate of dumplings (all 12!!) all to myself. I want to slurp their peanut butter noodles for $2. I want to have a bowl of peeled noodles as opposed to the hand pulled. I like the peeled noodles so much better. They are like wonton wrappers dissolved and so soft you don't even have to chew. I like food that is effortless. I like the taste of their broth, soup that has been sitting on the stove for hours, and beef that has been stewed until tender. I like biting into my fishball and finding a porkball. Say what?! I want to one day find a duck's foot at the bottom of my bowl. Kinda gross, but like a rabbit's foot I think it is good luck! I think it is also funny that the duck hand pulled noodle soup is described as taco. Perhaps they really meant taro but does that sound like a typical Chinese combination as well?If you're a superficial person, stay away from my Sheng Wang. It may look dirty or sketchy from the outside but the truth is that it is really clean inside and the service is great. This is a $7 lunch or dinner for sure and I love it.

While we were having our desserts, they also brought us a bottle of Sambuca, Lemoncello, and another liqueur I can't remember.Service - The best and the most friendly! From beginning to end, all of the waiters here are extremely friendly. They made all of us felt very welcomed. The service here is absolutely outstanding.

1423,26,17,5.0,"In the past, there are a few places in the Chinatown in Manhattan that you could find Malaysian styled Jerky. They were always a delicious but slightly expensive treat.  Over the years, the establishments that sells these jerky dwindled and now I could think of two places that still makes and sells these. One of them is this tiny store between the edge of Chinatown and the beginning of what's left of Little Italy.When I say small, I meant small. You'll be lucky to squeeze in 5 people into the space between the wall and the counter where you place your order. This aforementioned glass counter is where they put all of the selections of the Jerky that they have on display. Despite their name of ""Malaysia BEEF Jerky"", they also carry dried meat made of chicken and pork.Besides the meat, they have two styles of Jerky. One, the ""Sliced"" beef and pork, are more familiar to the American Palate of beef jerky. Dry, tough, and tasty. The other style, the more Malaysian one, is thinner, semi moist, and slightly sweet with a slight smoky aftertaste. Each version of the Malaysian styled ones have a ""spicy"" variation that have only the slightest hint of heat in them. There are two things you should to know about these Jerky before hand. One: They charge by pound, and at $17 to $18 per pound, the price would add up fast. Usually people buy by quarter pounds but it is easy to go slightly above the requested weight that you ask for.Two: The semi moist Jerky, although really tasty, doesn't stay put as well as the dried variety. It's best to place them in the fridge unless you plan to eat them all within a day or two... which considering how delicious they are, could easily happen despite your best efforts not to.",30,0.9925
1424,15,7,5.0,"I have been looking for a place of ""ZEN"" for a very long time now. I never really actually believed that it would exist, but I have FOUND IT. In New York City of all places. I was recommended by a friend in yoga two weeks ago of a Wellness Center, meets chiropractic services and medical spa. Everything I need to make myself whole again. I was working 12+ hours every weekend and some weekdays. I had strained my lower back and built plenty of muscle tension in my shoulders from carrying loads of heavy equipment. My first visit was last Wednesday 10/5/11. My experience was so pleasant from the minute I walked in. The dim lit wellness center made me feel relaxed and ready with no expectations of what would begin or end. I was greeted by a nice receptionist and she lead me to my first examination with Dr. Joe Caracillo. He is a noted chiropractor, popular yoga instructor, and respected health expert. In my mind I knew I was in good hands because I use to read Cosmopolitan magazines and he would give some insightful advice on different yoga positions! My exam started out with a back, neck and jaw adjustment. I never realized that I clench my jaw in my sleep, and he made me aware of it. He also attached a Russian muscle therapy machine to my lower back to help alleviate any tension I was having. Immediately I could feel the tingling and buzzing that cured any issues I was having!After my examination and chiropractic treatment, I was sent downstairs for my massage with Eviee. She was this sweet, soft spoken Asian girl that I never expected would of made me feel 110% again! The massage was 60 minutes long and she worked on all the knots I had in my lower back and my shoulders. It was a mix of deep tissue and shiatsu style. After the massage I was realizing I could get use to this. Maybe once a week?! She left the room and when I exited the room I was greeted by her and an Organic Avenue Veggie Elixir Drink! I was extremely impressed. When I went upstairs to check out, Dr Joe was there to ask me how much I enjoyed my first visit. He also mentioned that Organic Avenue is a participant in his Wellness Spa and any drinks can be ordered prior to your treatment. They also stock up on a couple as well. I have never been to a spa that treats you that good with Organic goodies! On Wednesday 10/12/11, I was interested in trying Pilates, so I booked a session of Pilates with Fabricia. My yoga friend said that she was the BEST in New York, and she definitely lived up to her reputation. I tried a combination of Yoga and Pilates before, called Yoga-Lates, but never this true method. I actually used the Pilates machine with her and tried all these different stretching, pulling and pushing methods I never knew my body could handle, but it did! One thing I still had to work on though, was my shoulders. They sort of have a mind of its own. All I had to think was relaxation time and I improved significantly. She recommended that I come in the next day for a massage to loosen up soreness. Thursday 10/13/11, I booked a massage with Matt. He has very limited availability at Space for Wellness. That is because he is very popular and usually takes a couple weeks to book a session with him! Hes in that high demand! I dubbed him Magical Matt because the minute I met him, I knew his presence was exactly what I needed to relax. His calming voice and his selection of music went with the flow of the massage. The strength and use of his fingers and palms of his hands made me imagine ocean waves against my back. He worked out every tension I had and I felt like a whole new improved me! After the session, I was given Organic Avenue Blueberry Smoothie with Sprutilna. So yummy and perfect for hydration. I think I could totally get use to this.Realizing that they have Facebook specials at 30% during the week, you know I am going to make this a weekly trip an treat myself to maintaining my health and well being!",12,0.9992

We were greeted at the door by a hostess who was so striking that I couldn't concentrate for a few minutes. Her intense stare and brilliant red lipstick led me into a trance. It felt like a dreary night in London and how lovely to tuck into a speakeasy where everything is a secret. And so the culinary affair with Maison begins.The place is dimly lit and oddly enough, time stood still at 10:40pm.

Definitiely a great place to get up-close and personal with that intimate person in your life. Our waiter, ever so kind and personable, took our drink orders. I opted for a Santa Maria Cooler. It is made with rum, sherry, lemon and pineapple syrup. A sharp and clean drink and not too sweet. This is a raw bar. So don't expect to find anything cooked or any meat. You are here for the seafood and trust me, this place is well worth it. We shared the ""La Petit Maison"" platter, red snapper ceviche and also had 6 additional oysters.

The red snapper was excellent, I am usually very wary of red snapper as it has a rough consistency, but this ceviche was on point, tasty and fresh. Come here for fresh seafood and of the highest quality. I also had an absinthe drink, Bitches Breaux. Strong and by the end of my drink, I was on my way to hallucinations.

After lugging my sack of change through the hot, sweaty streets of Manhattan, I was ready for the cool respite of the 35th floor, high above the throngs of grossy people. You are greeted at the front desk with tea and spa slippers before you walk back for a tour of the treatment rooms and water therapy room. I picked the Spa because I had a hankering for a jacuzzi and water therapy pre-treatment. I feel in love love love with the water therapies at the Wailea resort in Maui, and was looking to re-create a teensy bit of that experience in NYC. Knowing that teensy-ness would apply to the size of any spa in NYC, I was overjoyed to find a wade-in jacuzzi pool. One side has an immersed chaise lounge built of metal tubes. You can have a lie down on the metal tubes and the jets and bubbles come from underneath you, so you're nestled in a jetty-bubbly-uplifting-rollicking water bed of actual water. I did not move for 25 minutes until my treatment started.The Spa is not a place to cheap out, so I opted for the 2 hour Time Treatment, where you basically customize your 2 hour treatment. I ended up opting with their suggestions. I started with a body scrub-first a brush down with a hard brush, then a slathering of minty exfoliating rub. An all-over mini-massage to smooth out your skin. After a quick hop in the en suite shower, I had a long, luxurious traditional massage with some sports massage thrown in to ease my tired muscles. Followed by a facial massage (not a real facial, I don't do those) and a scalp masage. During the 2 hour treatment, I entered a zen-like blissful state, not quite sleeping and not quite dreaming but just luxuriating in the warm, enveloping feeling of having my muscles pulled and prodded into mush. Afterwards, I napped in the relaxation room, sipping orange water, noshing on dried apricots and nuts, watching the leaves blossom in Central Park. Then headed to the locker room to slowly dress and return to reality. My skin was smooth, my muscles melty, my mind blank as I was whisked down the elevator to the hot, mean streets of Manhattan...(...and MSG for HOCKEY...where I promptly lost all Zen in chanting ""fight! fight! fight!)This girl would make the Manadarin a monthly-must-do if it weren't for having to haul all those troublesome pennies.",18,0.9006

1431,28,22,5.0,"How the hell am I ever supposed to know exactly when I'm devouring the best pizza of my life? How many Fridays growing up did my father come home with a pipin' hot pie for dinner? How many singles did I spend in elementary school on slices handed out by class moms? How many drunken escapades have been night-capped at a pizzeria? How many foodie adventures have I embarked upon where pizza was the X that marked the spot?Let's see, we've gotta be able to approach this (somewhat) mathematically. Let's assume I eat pizza once a week. The first four years of my life (when I was either not eating solid foods or trying to be convinced broccoli was delicious) are pretty much a wash when you factor in the four years I was at college (when my pizza intake was more like twice every seven days). That's something like 1,410 times in my life I've sat down for (at least) a slice! I repeat - how the hell am I ever supposed to know exactly when I'm devouring the best pizza of my life?Well, ridiculous odds against this Greenpoint pizza joint aside, I'll be damned if I didn't feel something special as I took down Paulie Gee's Hellboy (Fior di Latte, Italian Tomatoes, Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano, and, the kicker, Mike's Hot Honey). What I am confident in proclaiming is that, with all of the 1,409 times to come before it, I have never had a pizza quite like this one. The spicy, dry-cured Italian salami, sliced like pepperoni and strategically placed to cover the entire pie, had exceptional flavor. Each slice was thin, foldable, and accented by the traditional Neapolitan puffed crust. And, as for the few drops of honey - I said Goddamn! This pizza's hot enough to clear an asthmatic's sinuses on the first pollen-polluted day of spring! Honestly, this combination of heat and sweetness really took it into another stratosphere. It's like Mr. Paulie Gee spent sixteen years perfecting textbook pizza in his spare time, then quit his desk job just to toss those textbooks out the window, opened up a trendy, top-of-the-line establishment on the fringes of Brooklyn, and turned the New York pizza scene on its head. Oh, wait - because that's exactly what happened.As if one tremendous-tasting pizza wasn't enough, I also went for the In Ricotta Da Vita (Italian Tomatoes, Sweet Italian Fennel Sausage, Pecorino Romano, Post Oven Ricotta Dollops, Baby Arugula and Extra Virgin Olive Oil). Bolstered by some of the freshest tomatoes I've ever tasted, this light, angelic pie was the perfect counter to the Hellboy's devilish scorch. Plus, you've gotta love the clever monikers that appear on Paulie Gee's menu, notably the playfully-named Brian DeParma and the fennel-heavy Anise and Anephew.As for the decor, well, imagine a barn. Now, try to envision said barn pumpin' out super-chill classic rock. Finally, picture this barn to be so damn rustic and classy that it doubles as a legitimately romantic date spot. It's no wonder Paulie Gee's hosts a packed house night after night. We were quoted an hour wait at the door, and while we were seated after only twenty minutes, I would've gladly waited the full sixty to taste pizza this delicious.While downing the Hellboy, I struggled to determine where it stood among the ranks of my own personal Pizza Hall of Fame. Had I reached the top? In the eternal words of The Strokes, ""Is This It?"" Like most life-affirming moments, you're never really sure until that moment has long passed. So, again, I ask myself - how the hell am I ever supposed to know exactly when I'm devouring the best pizza of my life? It's a question that may forever go unanswered, but the Hellboy sure as hell gives the best of the best a real-deal run for their money.",30,0.9798

Votive reflections flicker against your friend's irises, making him/her more fascinating and compelling than moments before---and that's just the prelude.The menu immediately sends a small fire of dopamine to the conscientious diner's brain: Vesta only sources happy animals, and tries to feed you locally grown foods (and fermented grape juice) whenever possible.$18 for a half liter tasty light white wine (grown and aged down the road in Long Island) is a solid entree. Soft bread and olive oil appear quickly on a wood board. The bread is fresh but dries quickly, making it ideal for dipping into dairy-free asparagus soup dressed up with a poached egg.We shared the chicken leg/thigh nested among stewed black eyed peas, and orrechiette with artichokes and mushrooms, garnished heavily with parsley and earthy parmesan. Upon doing research, my suspicions were confirmed: the chef is Italian, and cooks with great love for food and diners alike. The owners grew up in Astoria, and wanted to open a place in the neighborhood that honors the local greenmarket.

1434,32,1,5.0,"Last year I worked at a Veteran's Hospital, providing counseling for men and women who had recently returned from Iraq and Afghanistan and were suffering from PTSD, depression, and substance abuse. It was an incredibly intense experience. It also gave me a renewed appreciation for the men and women who serve in the military, what war looks like from an individual perspective, and how challenging it is to return to ""real life"" after living through a war. I have never had more respect than I do now for the men and women I served during my time at that hospital.Now it is midnight.I walk arm in arm with a friend to honor those who perished in the Vietnam War. It is an occasion for silence.Ice and snow crunch underfoot as we wind our way through the quiet streets. It is a welcome reprieve from the typical hustle and bustle of downtown NYC, which leaves little room to breathe, let alone to pay your respects.The pathway is lined with the names of veterans inscribed in steel plaques. The glass sculpture to which it leads stands tall, filled with a glowing, internal light. We stand in the snow and read the letters aloud. Letters from soldiers to mothers, brothers, wives, children, who they will never see again. I think about how history repeats itself. I stare at the perfect icicles that hang from the top of the monument and watch as they sparkle in the night light. I think about how lucky I am.If you have never been, it is worth a visit to see this beautiful sculpture, a testament to all of those who have served, and to remember them.",32,0.6306

1436,15,12,5.0,"Indulging in a food centric vision of the afterlife, I can easily see an eternity at Del Posto as a reward for having led a life of trying new cuisines, writing helpful reviews and being an elite yelper. And I'd gladly order from the five course menu again and again, an eternal recurrence of the same exceptional experience that marked my recent birthday.Instead of being welcomed to the pearly gates by St. Peter, I was instead (literally) asked by the legendary Lidia Bastianich how my meal was, who happened to be dining about 15 feet away from our table as she made the rounds.Was this a test? Failure to properly answer results in an eviction from paradise where I must forever make my own meals and never dine out again?I mustered up my courage and replied that everything was excellent and that I really enjoyed her shows. A gracious nod, thank you and smile and heaven on a plate resumed.So Del Posto is a Bastianich-Batali joint, a massive restaurant in the Meatpacking District that literally means 'instead of'. (Thanks google translate...which is apparently entirely off. ""The Place"" is more like it.)There's no a la carte ordering from the menu. You'll either order from the $115 five course or $145 seven. The man entrusted to explain our menu items was a passionate purveyor of culinary information, venturing into the origins of our food, preparation and other details that was music to my ears. Fine dining meet Wikipedia and I loved it.This is the kind of restaurant where your napkin is changed by a staff member equipped with napkin removing tongs. And if you need to get up and use the restroom, someone quickly swarms by to inch the table out so you don't have to.I started with Lidia's Lobster Salad. Light lobster flavors for the summer supplemented by tomato and celery, this was an appropriate start to an epic meal. My wife had a plate of prosciutto di parma as her antipasti which I gladly assisted in devouring.But my most enthusiastic discovery was the application of a lardo spread to bread. Butter, my friend, your days are marked as the topping of choice. Pure fat, pure decadence and pure tongue flavor explosion.Up next were the pasta plates. Each person chooses a plate which is presented to both people dining. I opted for the ricotta pansoti with Green and White Asparagus & Black Truffle Butter. Pansoti best resembles a ravioli and literally means 'little belly'. My belly became a bigger one after relishing the sheep's milk ricotta filling. This was a rich pasta dish but fortunately the portion wasn't overwhelming. Up next was my wife's pick of spaghetti with Dungeness Crab, Sliced Jalapeno & Minced Scallion. You could definitely experience the heat of jalapeno with this dish. I also enjoyed the minced scallion, adding a crispiness to experience that I hadn't experienced before while eating spaghetti. My main course was an order of baby lamb alla Romana, Garlic Yogurt with Ceci & Swiss Chard Ragu. A milk-fed lamb between six and eight weeks old I'm sure this would be a target of a PETA campaign. Ethics aside, this was some of the most tender lamb I've ever experienced, offering no resistance while chewing. The ceci (chickpeas) and chard ragu were the perfect complement to this particular meat. Having survived four courses and nearly full, I was relieved to see that my Butterscotch semifreddo, Sour Cherries, Preserved Melon Agrumata, Crumbled Sbrisolona & Milk Jam was not an overpowering mass. The dessert may be semi frozen but it was all good as I savored each spoonful. We were also given a box that included two small italian donuts, a caramel with edible rice wrapper, lollipops and a few other tiny sweet treats.Nearly three hours later, it was finished.For a special occasion dining experience, Del Posto exceeded my expectations. You don't go here for a typical red sauce experience but for fine Italian dining meets French presentation and service. This was a stellar gift that my wife gave me and I am eternally grateful.",17,0.9971
1437,15,0,5.0,"At Cafe Kiev, courses are the most important part. Bring a bunch of friends, move the tables together, and order as much as possible. I was lucky enough to be dining with one Ukrainian for this meal and a few other friends, so we let him do the ordering and settled in for a good night. Three hours later we were practically needing to roll ourselves down Kings Highway when we left.The small dining room just off the main road is trying hard to be trendy and sleek, but fails just enough (in a very awkwardly good way) to make you feel comfortable for your home-cooking. The odd color scheme, glass chandeliers, maps of Kiev and Ukraine, and various random art, as well as tables of Russian and Ukrainian-speaking groups make this a legitimate excursion spot even before you look at the menu.The order seemed a tad strange, but I present the meal as it was presented to us.COURSE #1:Solenya ($3.95) and bugenina ($5.95). The solenya is a grouping of cabbage and onions and pickles, really just a way to get your mouth warmed up.The bugenina was listed on the specials board, so I was a bit surprised to see it come out on the first round. It is a cold dish though, and is served with some very special ""Russian wasabe,"" a beet and horseradish mixture that really added a nice pop to the slices of pork.#2:As we were finishing up the first dishes, two more arrived in the form of the fresh cabbage and cucumber salad ($3.50) and the salad olivie ($3.95). The former looked amazing but had a bit less taste than expected. Never fear, a dash of salt and pepper and a squeeze of the lemon was zest enough. I think it could have stood a more liberal sprinkling of dill as well.The olivie was a very familiar taste, like a potato salad and egg salad in one. It was thoroughly laced with mayonaise, but not overwhelmingly rich somehow. The Ukrainian amongst us commented that it was like eating another family's olivie, simply saying it was not like mom's. We all sort of tasted it and probably were a little afraid to admit our pleasure seeing as how ""low class"" we might have felt, but the dish disappeared quite rapidly nonetheless.#3:The third round was devoted to soups, and we sampled three. The first to arrive was the kharcho ($3.95), which I overheard described simply with ""It needs more crap in it."" Dark red broths usually lead to amazing results, so I think all of our expectations were built up very high. The soup is good, but definitely the weakest of the three given how good it can be.A definite winner was the frikadelki ($3.95), a chicken meatball soup with an excellent thin broth. The firm meatballs were good for cutting up and sharing, eating alone, or with the broth. If it were my bowl, I would have even gone so far as to place a big dollop of sour cream inside of it.Luckily, I was able to do just this with the third soup we sampled, borshch ($3.50). This was my hands-down favorite of the round, and had me smiling from its not too beet-y but just beet-y enough deliciousness. This general good mood lasted for a nice digestive intermission before the next foods started arriving.#4:Things started getting real serious the moment our two plates of vareniki ($5.95 w/meat, $5.50 w/potatoes and mushrooms) arrived. These little guys were the real deal, nothing like you will find frozen and thawed in hipster Eastern European restaurants in Cobble Hill.Although the cabbage was a bit soggy (an unfortunate consequence of not making them right when ordered), the golubtsy ($5.95) were otherwise spot on, bursting with flavor unlike any other restaurant-bought version. These stuffed cabbage rolls were very good.Our final entree was the meat cutlets ($6.95), two beef-veal-chicken patties served with buckwheat. This is not actually an accompaniment option, but we had an insider who asked for it instead of the available home fries, mashed potatoes, or rice. This made for a far more interesting dish.#5:With no room in our stomachs left, the table made the bold decision to order more. Out came an odd rendition of baklava and a nice pancake dish served with strawberries and bananas (below). The edges of the pancakes were nicely crispy, something I had never seen before.Even if you do not order dessert, go ahead with a pot of tea, which is served like you see it below, with sugar, lemons, and a bowl of sour cherries. These cherries are good for eating alone or with the pancakes, but also are traditionally dropped into the tea themselves. The syrup of them sweeten the tea enough so you don't need the sugar cubes, which are not supposed to go into the tea, but rather held between the teeth as you drink so that the tea passes through it.The whole ensemble and process of this tea time was very rewarding and felt good. We ended up prolonging our stay by at least 30 minutes because of it. As we poured second and third glasses, we were told stories of the golden gate of Kiev and the horse chestnut, the city's official flower.",17,0.9989

Oh yeah boyee..I get to the counter and ask for 12 Caramel fleur de sel.(French Accent) No, Sorrie, we are all out.Ok.... Orange Blossom?(French Accent) No no. Sorrie, we are all out.I start shaking like a crack head. (Brooklyn Accent) Lemme have Cassis, Pistachio, Coconut, Raspberry and Chocolate. Oh yeah and a Madeline.Ladurée is a cute upper east side store. They sell expensive jelly's and French candles. Just something to point out. There is a long line and everyone is loving the Macarons. Great! There is no way that I'm spending $70 on a candle unless they have scents like ""Stripper"" or ""Burger King"".So, I bring my purchase outside and rip open the box like a crazed person and I bite into a Ladurée Macaron. My first impression was they are very fresh and Its smaller than what I expected. It kinda reminds me of Kees Chocolates. Soft. Delicate.I have to chalk this place up to Clinton St. Baking Company. Great place to visit once but the line is mind numbing, I liked the Macarons but I'd rather go to La Maison du Macaron on 23rd with no line.Enjoy!",24,0.9852
1448,16,7,5.0,"I never would have found Telepan without Yelp, as it's neatly tucked away on 69th St. with a very unassuming entrance. But boy am I glad I did!Everything about Telepan was top class, from the service to the ambiance, and of course the food. Do yourself a favor and pony up the dough (around $60, if memory serves) for the 4-course tasting menu. You'll be glad you did. The portions are relatively small, but with four delicious dishes, it's enough to fill you right up.I started with the vegetable-bread soup, which was a light soup with a piece of bread soaking at the top. It kind of reminded me of a French onion soup, but without the wicked breath.For the mid-course, it was lobster bolognese, a spaghetti in light tomato sauce with a chunk of lobster meat on top. The pasta was great and the lobster fell out of the shell and melted in my mouth.My main course, which in reality wasn't any larger than any of the other courses, was the roasted chicken, which was the most tender piece of chicken I've ever eaten in my life. I barely needed a knife to cut it, as it practically fell apart at the touch of a fork. The gnocchis on the side were also amazing.But, as usual, the meal's highlight was dessert. Telepan S'more. Eat it. WOW! A dark chocolate brownie on the bottom, a giant toasted marshmallow in the middle, and graham cracker ice cream on top. Oh good God was it awesome.My (wonderful) date and I also shared a reasonbly-priced bottle of white wine and our total bill, including a 20% tip for excellent service, was just over $200. Not a bad deal for such a great meal (rhymes!). Telepan is great, and since they open at 5 p.m. for dinner, that gives you more than enough time to have a great meal before heading down to Lincoln Center for a little culture. I definitely want s'more of Telepan.",20,0.9975

Our every request was honored and the staff went above and beyond to make us happy. I was very very impressed.Food: delicious. I loved almost everything, from the seared tuna appetizer to the palette cleanser, especially the peppermint ice cream served with dessert. The only thing that actually wasn't good to me was the chocolate souffle. I just didn't care for it, but our waiter more than made up for that by stuffing me with cotton candy and various chocolates from the bon bon bar! Also, brought me more ice cream. I was a happy girl! Presentation was also really nice, portions were satisfying as well.Ambiance: this is a great place to come celebrate a special occasion although we were not, most of the people around us were. It's got a very welcoming atmosphere, too. Not too stuffy and very elegant at the same time. Great for a romantic night out.The only thing that would have made this better would be if Gordon Ramsay was actually there :) Otherwise, a wonderful experience and recommend doing the splurge.

1451,15,3,5.0,"You want fresh seafood? Sabry's has got it!It's a rare experience to be able to enter an Egyptian restaurant and find a menu entirely devoted to seafood. It's just that. Seafood. The menu is not cluttered with crowd pleasing ""Middle Eastern"" dishes such as falafel or kebabs. The waitstaff also doesn't make a hard sell on the restaurant's short list of tagines or dips. Naw: this place is all about seafood.So serious that when you choose your fish -- be it salmon, red snapper, porgie, tilapia or branzini -- you go up to the display case and pick out your actual fish, served-whole and lounging amongst other catches-of-the-day on a bed of ice. What you see is what you get. You can have it any way, simply grilled, fried or barbecued Egyptian style with blackened spices on the skin and the organs still intact (you can also ask them to remove the organs). I love the straightforwardness of this place.Branzini, prepared in a traditional BBQ, was served as a whole fish, with meaty white flesh -- not flaky, but tender -- and rubbed with blackened Egyptian spices on the exterior. Mixed seafood tagine was a nice complement to the greater meal; a simple stew of tomatoes and garlic, cradling tender pieces of calamari and plump shrimp tails. Seafood-entree-for-two was a white-sauce stew of clams, white fish, lobster and mussels. It was priced at $50 but it's portion size was more than adequate to feed four people.

1453,27,20,5.0,"I admit it -- I'm a wretched snob. I judge based on looks and make a snap decision in under a minute. Brasilianville Cafe & Grill with its nondescript awning just wasn't cutting it. I barely skimmed a glanced at it before relegating it into the category of ""Places whose Threshold I Shall Never Cross."" Besides, it was a buffet and with the exception of a couple things, I'm not a buffet girl. Buffets conjure up too many memories of bad food sitting out. And you have to serve yourself. I like having people wait on me. That's how I roll. But after reading rave reviews from Suanne L, Lara G., and Jeff O., I had to reconsider. Perhaps, I might be *gasp* wrong???? The earth just shifted its axis in shock.Let me tell you how WRONG I was. I ate there three times in one week. And I would have gone there more often if I hadn't been staying at work really late. Yes, it's a buffet, but I swear that you've never had buffet food this GOOD because it's GREAT food. Period. Not great buffet food, but GREAT FOOD. They have a wide selection that changes every day. They always have rice and beans, some different kinds of chicken, some kind of spare ribs, and some different kinds of beef, and a salad bar. No matter what they have, the food is always phenomenal. I can't remember everything I ate, and sometimes I didn't know what I ate, but it was always really really good. The chicken was fork tender (we didn't need a knife to cut it). The brisket was delicious (I loved the gravy). The Brasilian chicken pot pie was incredible (I couldn't identify everything in it, but who cares, when it was sooo good and melted in your mouth). The corn bread was sweet and was more like the sweet moist Mexican cornbread than the dry American bread-like version. I had an event that I was running and needed it to be catered. We didn't have a large budget, but I needed to feed a reasonable crowd for a low price and that's when I thought Brasilianville would come through. They were willing to work with me and let me come a half hour before they opened to pick up the food (they even got the cashier to come in early just for me). I got a little bit of everything because I wasn't sure what the students were willing to eat. The students never had Brasilian food before and they were highly suspicious of it, but they had been well-trained to ""just take a little bit to try it."" With much trepidation everyone took one or two bites of everything. After they took one bite, they leaped out of their seats to get more. Like me, they were converted to the glory that the Brasilianville Cafe. You pay by weight, but honestly the prices are really reasonable and cheap considering how much food and great meat you get. $15 was enough for two meals for me (YMMV). This isn't a fancy place nor is it haute cuisine, but it is just really wonderful down home comfort food of Brasilian descent. The first time I was there, a regular greeted cheerfully and said that he had been brought there at first by a Brasilian friend of his and they had been going to Brasilianville Cafe for years.

And, getting the chance to do that at WSRPR, gave this nice gal a whirlwind of excitement! Thanks to my boyfriend, and a heavily discounted Yelp coupon, a group of 4 of us came here last Friday night to get our hands on some live firearms. There's no option of gun selection (it's the law), you get a semi-automatic rifle that loads .22mm bullets in the gun's magazine. We sat for about half an hour in a small classroom for some preliminary instructions by our badass guide, Howard, on how to handle the gun, load the bullets, fire it, and disable it. Howard was extremely thorough, and funny in flashes, and though he looked really tough, like he served in an army brigade, turned out he is actually some sort of computer nerd. Of course this fact does not take away from the reality that he's exceptional with a gun, and can probably kill you. Color that, fascinating. If you are looking to do something exhilarating, then look no further. I myself, got such an adrenaline kick off of shooting this gun, aiming directly in the concentric black circles, at that center, black target and shooting off 50 bullets, all while no one was harmed in the process (most important part). You can move your target around, as in, pushing it as far back as you think will challenge your aim. You feel safe b/c each stall is protected from your neighboring gun-wielder, and you can focus solely on pointing and shooting your firearm. It's tremendous fun. I got a few bulls-eyes and that was a great feeling. If you ever have some anger issues, you might want to take it out here at the gun range.

But what sealed the deal is the fact that I thought it was really amazing, tooWe dropped in without a reservation and immediately found a nice table outside. Our waiter was possibly the most bubbly man I've ever encountered in my life: very energetic and knowledgeable - I dare say the rare specimen of restaurant staff that actually enjoys his job, or fakes it really well, like I used to - when I worked as a waitress, guys- JEEZ get your mind outta the gutter! Hubby ordered the Parma Mussels and I got the Bisque. My food philosophy when it comes to my marriage is what's his is mine, and what's mine is mine. I played the marriage card during our meal, reaching over the table so much to dip my bread into that parmigiana creamy goodness, that he finally just gave me his mussels and took mine (which were also amazing). He jumped the gun and ordered fries, thinking the mussels wouldn't be enough. The fries were good but we definitely didn't need them. But the topping on the freaking cake was the dessert ... what's better than whoopie pie? That would be DEEP FRIED WHOOPIE PIE, oozing with melted cream cheese and crusted with white chocolate cream.

If memory serves, we got the Cinnamon Sugar, The Salted Caramel, The Fluffernutter and the Chocolate. Do you know what heaven tastes like? That would be perfectly light donuts filled with gooey sweet fillings.

The filling, unfortunately, still boasts of custard, but it was very well done. Very smooth, light custard, unlike the pudding-like consistency found in other cursed versions I've tried. Very very good flavors, full of vanilla bean. He had a croissant, which was probably the best he's had in awhile. Having polished off the first one in exactly 3 minutes, I sat on my hands for exactly 40 seconds before I ordered the praline mille-feuille. It's a must. I thought it would've been too sweet, coming from NOLA. But it wasn't, great great flavors, the pastry was perfect too. We also tried a chocolate praline macaron, that was way too sweet.

Later, we shared dim sum in Chinatown, sul long tang in Flushing, pad see ew in Elmhurst... Some of the most authentic meals available in a city with no shortage of competition.And now, she was leaving NYC. One last supper.I wanted to honor her with an exclamation point, one for the road. We were far past the point of me feeling the need to impress. Thus, Yasuda, 15 East: ethereal, but maybe too reverential for a send-off meant to be full of warmth. In fact, serious sushi at all was risky -- she would've been happy with simplicity, hominess.But Kanoyama was serious sushi with a difference. I'd once been a random walk-in at the omakase counter. The chef, Nobu-san, apologized for the poorness of the day's catch. Apologized! He then proceeded to blow me away. Not just with the food, but with the geniality he and my server Taku showed me. Rarely had I had such delicacy delivered with such warmth.It was that quality I hoped for again as I spirited my convive away from the desperately youthful energy of the East Village on a Saturday night. No main dining room for us: I'd eaten there too, and the regular-table delay between sushi making and consumption disturbed the equilibrium between rice and fish, turning the exquisite into the merely noteworthy. Instead, we settled at the dark-wooded omakase counter. Taku instantly remembered me from my visit 6 months prior. Chef Nobu-san quickly followed and effortlessly and efficiently prepared our first dish.Kanoyama's super omakase starts with appetizers. You may just want to mainline nigiri, but consider this: a square of grated mountain yam topped with an okra puree, surrounded by cool dashi flecked with wasabi and junsai. The slick chill of the junsai (an aquatic root with an intoxicating texture) melded with the smooth yam, cleansing and eye-opening. My convive looked up at me after one bite, surprised delight in her eyes, and I looked right back with a faintly smug expression. ""What did I tell you?""A blizzard of appetizers followed. Uni reclining on tofu and vinegar gelatin. Duo-toned noodles in a bracing ume-infused broth. A light sashimi course, including tiny whole cuttlefish and a gloriously marinated tuna. A bonito soup bathing some sort of fish -- I wasn't even listening by then, instead sneaking glances in my convive's direction, tracking her ""oohs"", her ""mmms"". And her intimations of getting filled up. I turned to Nobu-san and cried, ""So much wonderful food, but you're getting us full before we've even had any sushi!""""One more, one more,"" he said, bashful yet assured. He then placed a single piece of asparagus on each of our plates. What an elegant moment, following the fireworks with something so simple. Merely kissed by oil and dusted with green tea salt, shining a lustrous green, it entered my convive's mouth. Her voice instantly dropped an octave. ""This... is a good asparagus,"" she breathed.We asked where the asparagus was from. ""New Jersey,"" he said, cracking open the cedar bucket holding the sushi rice. What's past is prologue, right? A slice of the knife, a scoop of the hand, a twist of the arm, and there it was: a glistening piece of fluke bedded on a bolus of rice. He handed it *directly* into my convive's hand. ""I'll wait for you,"" she said.My eyes widened like saucers. ""NO. EAT NOW.""She did, her eyes shutting involuntarily in pure pleasure. As I would find out seconds later with my own piece, that fluke nigiri, so often a boring fish, shocked with its lucidity, and with the calibrated texture of the rice that I thought I'd overdreamed but hadn't, and my God, this was a *gift*, and I looked at Nobu-san and couldn't even say anything, and he smiled generously back at me, calm and unerring.What followed was a fever dream of nigiri. Red snapper dissolved before it even hit the throat. Shima-aji, delicate and decadent. Squid, firm yet yielding. Horse mackerel: uncured, oily, sublime. A brush of soy sauce here, a pinch of shiso there, perfect grace notes. Two large live shrimp, killed in front of us, and not in vain, their flesh evanescent as summer twilight. A bamboo-leaf package held a Chilean trout nigiri; how was it prepared? The trout was screamingly raw, but the rice had taken on the leaf's aroma, a fascinating combination. I'm forgetting things. Uni. Toro.Never mind the details. After all, dining perfection -- that alchemical mix of food, company, setting -- happens in spite of one's plans, not because of them. But for one special convive, I wanted our last hours together to be charmed, indelible. Food is the only way I know how. It can express emotions my clumsy words never could.

This is definitely a fun, off-the-beaten-path way to spend an afternoon, and at $20 for unlimited shooting, not a bad deal either. Since the guys who run this place do it on the side, they're pretty much only open weeknights and weekend afternoons. It's a very no-frills atmosphere, basically just a big room with targets on one side and equipment, seating and bathrooms on the other.It seemed that most of the other people there were avid shooters, many with their own bows and arrows. And man, did those bows look supremely badass! I was impressed with the variety in size and style. When we first arrived, we were a little intimidated and definitely stuck out like sore thumbs as newbies, but the regulars didn't pay much attention to us. Everyone was pretty focused on their own shooting...and focus is a good thing when there are 15+ people with deadly weapons in their hands! Guy, one of the co-owners who's a Long Island detective, joked that that's why he carries his handgun...you just never know! We were surprised when he handed us off to his young daughter, Valerie, to give us our tutorial. Even though she looks more like a gymnast than an archer, don't let her looks fool you! For one thing, she's older than she looks (something I can totally relate to). On top of that, she's very informative, knowledgeable...and badass! This was proven when she took her turn shooting some arrows. The bow was taller than her, but she totally commanded it! We were all in awe, as was Guy, who proudly compared her to Hit Girl from that Kick-Ass movie.We ended up spending five hours shooting, and had a great time chatting up Guy, Valerie and even befriending one of the kids whose dad had brought him.

I'm at peace now""This conversation gave me pause for thought while debating my rating. On the one hand, I was advocating moving beyond appearances, yet on the other I couldn't escape the suspicion that I was getting carried away by the ambiance at Tabare.My first visit had been spurred by the glowing reviews of Laura A, sarah w, and peter d. Now I may discount peter d's reviews (*) as his profile headline screams escape from responsibility (""when you're young, there are no mistakes. only research""), but I take 5 star reviews from Laura and sarah seriously. So, I will echo Laura's description of Tabare: ""Rustic style but sophisticated and yes, trendy too. It's charming. The lighting is beautiful. You will feel comfortable, it's cozy; it's sexy. You can fall in love."" Ok, that's where I draw the line. No amount of mood lighting, or sexy atmosphere can send me running to read Shakespeare, or Keats. It's what's on the inside that counts, so let's talk about the food. Now, that's where the relationship gets complicated. The extent to which Uruguayan cuisine is influenced by Italian, Spanish, and Portugese cuisines is surprising to one not too familiar with it. I debated for a while on what to order, looking for something different - but ultimately going with the empanadas (caramelized onions, gruyere & fontina cheese; and chicken, onions and peppers) and the handmade Ravioli of the day (goat cheese, ricotta, sun dried tomato, butter sage sauce). I got a taste of the things to come with the warm bread basket that was accompanied with homemade Tapenade and orange zest. Simple, but well executed: that was the theme of the entire meal. The empanadas were so different (thicker, but not heavier) in texture from any I've had in New York, that the next morning I engaged my Puerto Rican colleague in a long debate on this. The olive oil based dipping sauces served as the perfect accompaniment, till the taste buds were wowed by the Ravioli - which must also rank as one of the best I've had, and Italian is one of my favorite cuisines.I was also surprised by the Alfajor, as the ones I've had in the restaurants and bakeries in Jackson Heights are fairly consistent in their interpretation with each of the dulce de leche filled cookies being ~ 1/6th of an inch thick. The version at Tabare had cracker thin crisp cookies, with dulce de leche & chocolate ganache, and sea salt caramelized walnuts. It was different, and I liked it - but I appreciated the dule de leche flan more as it had a mousse like texture. I was fascinated with the way the flan wraps around the fork as you slice it down, alternating the grace of a ballerina with the sensuality of a stripper working the pole. This reverie was interrupted by ecstatic sounds from the table next to me upon being offered complimentary flan (the owner's grandmother's recipe). That HAS to be my pet peeve with Tabare: three visits - and not a single complimentary appetizer or dessert, when almost every table (with female patrons) has been rewarded.I would protest at the discrimination (*), if it weren't for the work ethic, dedication, attentiveness of the owners as they bring you water, serve you food, make recommendations, clean the table - one can only wish them well, and hope that they succeed in their ""hamlet away from the village"" (Tabare).Ultimately, when all elements: food, service, atmosphere, and value (~$35 per head) come together, how can one hold back one's affection? Sometimes, attraction is as much a result of how similar something is to what one knows, as it is about how different it is - especially if thoughtfulness ensures perfect execution on the details.========(*) I kid",42,0.9992
1463,26,13,5.0,"Initially when I first came in, I was not impressed. For one, no one seemed to be manning the counter or paying any attention to new customers coming in. We stood at the counter for a good 10 minutes before anyone cared to talk to us. The clerk at the front seemed a bit overwhelmed and apathetic at the same time. While we were waiting patiently, a man comes from the back and walks toward the counter. He greets us and is extremely friendly. I got a good vibe from him. And with things like body art, it is important to feel a good vibe. I told him what I wanted, and he immediately said it was no problem. In fact, he was also working on a similar symbol for another client. We agreed to an appointment for the next day. The next day arrives and we show up as soon as they open. It did take awhile before my appointment actually got started, but I am OK with that. This isn't a dentist's office. All I can say is Jeb Maykut is awesome, artistic, warm and professional. Jeb made sure to tell me that he was a licensed body artist and also that the store met all regulations for body art, which includes an infection control course and a licensing exam. He also made me feel right at home. It was extremely comfortable to work with Jeb and the 2 hours flew by. He was extremly considerate to his clients and asked what music they wanted to listen to while he did his work. I was OK with anything, but he put on Ladytron. Score! He even gave me a nice discount. This was a birthday present to myself. Jeb also offered touch-up for free once everything healed.I also learned that Jeb likes to do Japanese art design with a mystical twist. We chatted extensively about his interests and he wants to go to Japan to study with a body artist there. Please check out his artwork: jebmaykuttattoo.com/work…A clean and fun studio that is professional and at the same time friendly and serious about their work.

1464,10,5,5.0,"Just like how spaghetti and meatballs or meatloaf often evokes warm childhood memories for many, food here elicits those same sentiments from deep inside me. Raised by a Szechuanese mother, my favorite childhood foods were without a doubt mapo tofu, double-cooked pork belly with leeks, water boiled fish, stir-fried potatoes with chilis, blistered long peppers, and spicy braised chicken. However, it has been over a decade since I last tasted those wonderful creations from my mother, as she stopped cooking in the house after the 4th grade. Although I now do not eat Szechuan cuisine on a regular basis, my appreciation for this unique regional cooking has not diminished the least bit. However, I am rather picky about Szechuan restaurants I have come across over the years, especially in NYC (there are many more viable options in Los Angeles), as I can't help but to compare them to those from my cherished childhood recollections.I must say, Szechuan Gourmet comes pretty close to my mother's cooking. In fact, I was first introduced to this place 3 years ago when my mom visited the city from back west. She insisted we have dinner here out of all the other more ""prestigious"" restaurants in the city... well, if it's good enough for her (someone born and raised in Szechuan) then it's good enough for me!I highly recommend the water boiled sliced fish fillets swimming in a hot pool of chili oil (labeled 4 peppers on their menu), but it really isn't that spicy. The Szechuan peppercorns really add a depth of flavor like you wouldn't expect, and the tender sole fillets along with napa cabbage and bamboo shoots add some crunch and textural balance. The wontons in hot chili oil is very good as well, as the sesame paste adds creaminess that helps cool down the heat. Blistered long peppers, mapo tofu, stir-fried string beans with pork bits, double-cooked pork belly and chili leeks, hot & spicy cold noodles and cumin lamb are great here as well.And if you don't like or can't eat very spicy food, don't fret. Even the most timid eaters can appreciate the other truly delicious (and milder) Chinese dishes at this place. They have some reliable seafood dishes, sesame chicken, frog legs, and scallion pancakes that taste better than most versions found in Chinatown.I don't normally review Chinese restaurants because my standards for Chinese food are almost impossibly high. Being half-Szechuanese, my standards for Szechuan cuisine are therefore even higher. Trust me, come here for the best Szechuan cuisine in NYC!",16,0.9978
1465,31,16,5.0,"$1 Oyster Special All Day, Every Day! How can you not love just the sound of these words?!Cornelius spots a curved wooden ceiling and exposed brick walls, a beautiful, long bar covered in mosaic tiles, and unobstructed view that is just perfect to watch the sun set in Brooklyn while sitting at the bar.The bar[1] offers 10 draft beers, with flights priced between $5 (two beers) and $10 (four beers). Interestingly, they also serve a German riesling and a Long Island merlot on tap[2]. From their cocktail list, I tried The Cornelius: lime, honey and sage muddled together with gin. A bit too light for my liking, but balanced and certainly very refreshing. It goes very well with oysters.During a recent visit, we were fortunate enough to meet new chef Chris Caracciolo: an enthusiastic guy with a genuine passion for oysters, which he gets fresh on a daily basis. Chris likes to keep the rotating oyster menu at Cornelius interesting, with unusual picks alongside some classics. After sampling a couple of plates of Blue Points[3], we wanted to get a few Kumamotos. Unfortunately they were out of Kumamotos that evening, but chef Caracciolo gave us a few Hammersley oysters (WA) to try for free: deep-cupped, creamy-white, plump, with a strong, sweet flavor and a mineral, mild finish. I loved them!Alongside with drinks and oysters, we also got the flat bread with pancetta, truffled goat cheese, and wild mushrooms ($10). It is as good and satisfying as it sounds.Overall Cornelius is a great bar to mingle and relax. For its nice, welcoming atmosphere, no attitude, and great oyster happy hour, the bar at Cornelius gets five well deserved stars.--------------------------------[1] Drinks Happy Hour Monday all Night, and 5pm - 7pm daily .[2] A method that prevents oxidation, apparently.[3] Blue Points can be a bit of a hit-or-miss thing, but in this case they were nice, plump oysters that were surprisingly rich in flavor.",36,0.9988
1466,19,21,5.0,"Red Hook is one of the most inconvenient neighborhoods in the city. Public transportation does little to get you there easily, its shoreline makes for a particularly brutal and unbearable winter, and even the cast of The Real World: Brooklyn had no clue what to make of this place. And yet, it is often regarded as some fabled, far-off land. People will dedicate a full day to explore this mythical shanty town and all of the quirks that come along with it - a near-mandatory stop at Red Hook Lobster Pound appearing almost always on their agendas.I am not one of these people.No, I let the lobsters come to me. By way of their fancy food truck, Big Red! And this stands to be one of the bigger exceptions to the whole brick-and-mortar shop vs. park-and-serve vehicle, where the latter may actually prove to be the better of the two, based on convenience alone. That's right - I said it.Either way, at the center of this whole operation is, of course, their famous Lobster Rolls. I've had both of their signature sandwiches (Connecticut and Maine) and, let me tell you, choosing between them is like choosing between your own two children, between The Godfather and The Godfather, Part II, between James Bond and Jason Bourne, between Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen, between Cap'n Crunch and Count Chocula, between Jenny McCarthy and Carmen Electra, and, of course, between Edward and Jacob. I know!As with most things, it all comes down to preference. If you like your lobster warm and drenched in butter (and who doesn't?), look no further than the Connecticut Roll. This Constitution State variety is simple in execution, but big on taste, thanks in part to the exceptional top-split bread soaking up all that delicious, buttery goodness. Plus, the crustacean chunks they stuff into this bun are no-joke huge. However, if you like your lobster cold and served with mayo (really, who doesn't?), make yours a Maine Roll. The freshness of the lobster is on full display here, accompanied by celery garnish and some seriously special spices sprinkled on top. And again, the bread - so heavenly, it should hold together every sandwich. Either way you choose, I'm tellin' you - you can't go wrong.As for the whole food truck experience, what helps keep the line down is the $16 price tag, effectively warding off all the (how do I say this without offending anyone?) poor people. A full-portioned lobster roll is gonna cost you $30 and beyond at any other seafood joint. So while it may exceed the daily lunch allowance you've given yourself, the money spent is certainly no rip-off - it's actually very reasonable. And while you're at it, might as well splurge for their Hook-Up special for three bucks more, which adds to your order a bag of Cape Cod Potato Chips and Maine Root soda of your choosing (I go Mandarin Orange). And if you happen to be a huge dork, discover via their Twitter account that the first twenty people to wish Big Red and Company a ""Happy National Lobster Day"" on June 15th, then go ahead and do just that, well, you may be handsomely rewarded with a free Red Hook Lobster Pound t-shirt. Not that I have the 2XL 100% cotton garment to prove it or anything. Please.And in case you were wondering (I'll narcissistically assume you were): my unborn first son, Part II, Bond (although Bourne would win in a fight), whichever one is Blake Lively, Cap'n, Carmen, and Edward.

1467,15,13,5.0,"At Forcella, your taste buds will very quickly distinguish the flavor of Napoli from everything else. Frankly, I don't know which part of Napoli they send ""cooks"" from Olive Garden. Maybe it's ""Little Napoli"" somewhere in the back streets of Newark. Maybe it's some guy named Tony ""Napoli"" Romano who teaches out of his apartment in Brooklyn. I don't know. All I know is that my mouth and taste buds thanked me for treating them to a true authentic taste of Napoli, which I got here at Forcella. They also slapped me around a bit and said - ""Max, you are our owner, and we love you. But don't ever go against the palette and take us to Olive Garden. Ever."" I came here for lunch and was lucky to get a taste of the brunch menu as well. I started with the Amalfi salad made up of radicchio, arugula, gorgonzola, pear, and nuts. Served over olive oil directly imported from Napoli, this was a symphony in my mouth with every ingredient playing a distinct part from the crispiness of the pear to the freshness of the radicchio.  Following that up with some Antipasti, I initially was going to go with the Prosciutto Mozzarella, but wanted to try something original since you can get that dish at any Italian restaurant, so I ordered the Caponatina instead. The eggplant, zucchini, potato, red pepper, and tomato was perfectly grilled. Even though it was delicious, it was also very light, because l gotta be honest - I did worry that I was not going have room for the main course. For the main course, I was craving a red pizza, but heard rave reviews about the pizza carbonara, so decided to get both and have leftovers for the next day. For the white pizza, I ended up with the Pizza Carbonara from the brunch menu. I am pretty sure Giulio, the chef and the genius behind this shindig, is the only one that bakes his pizzas with ice. I was curious, so I kindly asked him WTF - what kind of flavor is he adding with ice? If I wanted soggy pizza, I'd call Pizza Hut. It turns out that the temperature in the oven, which is also imported from Napoli, is 1000 degrees. In order for you not too burn the egg and dough and keep the temperature consistent, you put the ice in. When it came out, it was the best damn tasting bread. I usually leave the crust when I eat pizza, but here I ate the whole entire thing. With the tasty prosciutto on top, I got my meat fix.  My red pizza followed. You can judge a good pizza shop by ordering their most basic pizza, which is the Pizza Marguerite. This way, they can't disguise the base and foundation of the pizza - the cheese, bread, and tomato sauce - with a crapload of toppings. When it came out, even though I completely scarfed down my pizza Carbonara, I had to have a slice of this. The taste matched up to its aroma and actually brought me back to Italy. Holy Shitaly this was good. I had to stop at the 2nd slice because dessert was coming, but took it back with me across Manhattan and on a bus back to Jersey. The smell was so fresh and potent that I thought I was gonna get shanked and get my pizza taken away. I was gonna put a fight for this pizza...For dessert, I ended up getting the wheat pastry with cheese. When it comes out, it looks like it's going to be one of those Weight Watchers desserts without flavor. That's what you tell your friends so that you don't have to share. Scarf this down while you enjoy the moist, sweet taste of the cheese, stabbing anyone that comes close to it with your other hand. This pastry needs nothing else. No nutella, no cream. The cheese is so damn good that I'd choose this dessert over any other any day. Can't wait for this place to open up in Manhattan.",17,0.9963
1468,9,1,5.0,"Whoah. The bakers here are no joke. Whether the specific offerings are to your liking or not is a personal preference, but I think anyone who has done any baking or patisserie can appreciate the level of skill that it takes to perfect these goods. Their croissants are astounding. The layers of the dough are buttery and pronounced, crisp on the outside, with some bite to the interior layers. They melt on the tongue. It's a sublime experience which I'd almost given up on in the city. I say that I don't care for croissants, but it's a lie -- I don't care for the middling offerings of most bakeries. THESE would be enough to turn me into a croissant lover if I hadn't been lying about disliking them. The almond chocolate variation is perfect. There is plenty of sweet almond paste, but not enough to make the pastry cloying, and the chocolate is rich and used in moderation so that it doesn't overwhelm the almond or the buttery dough. Every bite feels like one is ingesting the years of training that it took to perfect this product. The Almondine baguette differs from the classic French baguette with the addition of 15% whole wheat flour. Each translucent, glutenous crag is speckled with almond colored wheat germ from the whole flour. The crust is chewy. I prefer the crispy crust that I get from baking my own baguettes & getting them fresh out of the oven. Although my interiors are quite good, the texture doesn't compare to the delicate interior texture of Almondine's baguette. The macaron shells are a little chewier than I like (I prefer the slightly drier ones at Madeleine's on 23rd). But the moistness of these shells does tend to convey flavor better than a dry macaron. (Like the too-crumbly offerings at Financiers.) The flavors are limited, but classic. And that seems to be a standard at Almondine. They aren't trying to be everything to everyone, but they are clearly aiming for perfection in everything that they choose to do.",12,0.9962

The immediate area does not seem to be great for keeping Mexican places afloat, but I truly hope these guys make it for a while. I think they could be in the top tier of the taco totem pole of Western Queens. Please do your part to keep this place alive - for my sake.You can't go wrong when you get the basics down. The tortillas are robust and well griddled. The meats are properly executed: The braised lengua, while slightly salty, comes as large chunks of beefy tenderness; the carnitas is moist and porksome with adequately dessicated and crisp edges; the suadera has nicely singed edges yielding to juicy meat and fat; the bistec has the clean flavor of beef and is so perfectly cooked that it's almost boring. Yes, it would be better if it were grilled over live fire instead of seared on the griddle - but really, I'm not complaining. If you're worthy enough to be given a bit of the fresh made tomatillo salsa, you should be grateful. And if you wonder aloud about whether they have roasted chiles and onions, you might find yourself lucky enough to have some prepared for you on the spot. Needless to say, the two cooks are friendly and accommodating in the tight space. And quite skilled at the art of the antojito. Any doubts you have should vanish when you see the milanesa de pollo - a perfectly deep-fried slab of flesh, crunchy golden brown outside, succulent inside. Too bad it only comes on a torta or a cemita (every respectable meat should come in a taco, I think). The cemita is respectable, authenticated by the use of papalo, emboldened by the chipotles en adobo, assuaged by the stringy quesillo. But isn't it the bread that always lets you down? A bit on the dry side, a tad too thick, taking away the balance from the rest. Alas. Next time, I will ask them to put it in two tacos instead and hope that they oblige.There are tortas galore, which is their real specialty, but I'll let you explore them for yourself - 19 offerings(!), in addition to 9 cemitas and 13 quesadillas.

As others have mentioned, the macarons here are slightly bigger than normal, which to me just means each macaron has two bites of deliciousness rather than one.

Each shell should contain a ""foot"", and if the foot doesnt exist it's not a properly made macaron.

The delivery guys are always pleasant, polite and my food are always hot. Just know that your hard shell tacos might not be so hard by the time it gets to you.

I'm sorry to the hardcore Catholics out there that are rolling their eyes at this seemingly lame sacrifice for 40 days. But really, it was hard. Especially since I happened to walk by this place many times this season and had to restrain myself from breaking down and ordering a batch. And I'm not one of those that takes breaks on Sundays.So finally after a long wait, I came by here to indulge and break my fast. Man.... it was worth the wait. I got a large cone to share with a friend. And seriously, it was life changing. I'm generally a ketchup or ranch person with fries, sometimes even a garlic mayo or ketchup-mayo person. Or when the craving hits, I'll even do Filipino banana ketchup. But holy crap... sauces like Pomegranate Teriyaki, War Sauce, Roasted Garlic, Mango Chutney, etc. had me spinning. Like all of my life's knowledge of French fries was suddenly turned upside down... Who would dare disturb the universe that is ketchup and fries?This place was amazing. I loved every tiny bit of my cone of happiness (to the very last salty crumb), all the sauces with it and the many, many samples of the other sauces. I even liked the mix of Mango Chutney with roasted garlic. It all just worked. After talking with the fry guys, they offered me a sample of their new recipe sauce which he aptly named ""OMG."" No joke, it probably is the more accurately named sauce since those are the only words that could describe the mix of flavors. It's not on the menu but it damn well should be. Maybe next year, I'll have to just give up Pomme Frites for Lent since staying away from this wonderful place will be hard enough!",20,0.9123

This is by no means a speakeasy yet the urgency to keep things hidden seems to exist here still in this subterranean playground. Leave the platform heels, sequined halter tops, and popped collars at home as dress codes have no place here. The booth seats open up revealing storage for those winter coats and for those women/men who still carry their entire lives in their purses. Free up your arms because when you hear your favorite 80s tunes come on, you'll be throwing your hands in the air and waving them up like you just don't ... give a fuck. Here the trendy bacon is not subtly added to your plate but instead is the star of an appetizer dish with maple syrup offered to dip these crispy, fatty bits.

The under appreciated tator tots sits in the bag and is quickly tore open and ravaged once it hits the table. The rest of the menu, while not innovative in any way are deliciously executed sports bar favorites that do a worthy job of soaking up that booze.

I am so glad I chose this place!It took a bit of time for her to be finished but I think that is because they have great work ethic here. And I'm glad that I had the extra time because Bark Slope Salon is in a great area with lots of fun shops to entertain myself with while I waited.When I picked her up I couldn't even believe she was the same dog that I dropped off. My jaw literally dropped. And no offense to her because she's an absolutely beautiful maltese but I have never seen her look so good. She smells fantastic and is soft and fluffy as can be. That is because they use top of the line shampoos and conditioners here.

1483,22,11,5.0,"I am definitely an S woman! Hear me roar! *insert cheers and gasps*Sheila Kelley's S Factor is the original creator of the oh so sinfully seductive pole dance workout that has been taking the nation by storm over the past few years. I had heard about this movement from one of my friends at UCLA and she highly recommended it as being one of the best and appealing workouts she's ever done. When I moved to NYC, I needed something to jump start my exercise routine to curb weight gain and decided pole dancing might be just the thing. I was a little worried about it though since I did have an ACL repair in high school but I was assured that my knee would be fine with the movements. They were right! I signed up for an intro class last October and I've been indulging in my Erotic Creature ever since! I look forward to my 2 hour class every single week and that, my friends, is something you need in order to work out. It has to appeal to you and you must truly want to go otherwise you'll drop the routine and just sit home and do nothing. Doing S Factor also got me into signing up for a gym so now I am working out at least 4 times a week... which is what I needed in my new post-college life. You can also sign up for smaller, shorter classes if you want more workouts on the side. As you take more levels or specialty classes, you are rewarded points that you can then use to redeem for other classes. That's a great little reward for someone like me who has been taking the classes for a long period of time.Pole dancing has certainly changed my body and made me stronger and more powerful. You should see some of the things I can do now; I can defy gravity, haha! People often write off pole dancing as a sexual, stripper only type of act but really, strippers can not do what my teachers can do. They are true athletes that compare to the athletic abilities of Cirque du Soleil. They are such beautiful and strong women. Pole dancing is NOT about dancing for a man, or even a woman. It's about dancing for yourself. It gives you such confidence in your own sexy self and the woman-only environment is very warm and friendly. I've made some wonderful friends here and I look forward to another year as an S woman. My S Factor's New Year's resolution is to be able to do the splits and meet the lovely Sheila Kelley. I love S Factor!P.S.: S Factor is NOT cheap but if you have a financial situation, you can apply for scholarships or even partake in a work study to make it more than affordable. If you ever want to take a half-off intro class, just PM me and I can email you the offer; all current students have a referral program! Disclaimer though, do not blame me if you become addicted to the Movement... but you can thank me later ;)P.S.S.: As a fun note, in my first 8 week class (Level One) I had Kyra Sedgwick as my partner! How cool is that. She was so sweet and great on the pole!",21,0.9992

A fat(ty) thick classic arepa, make of chewy sweet corn dough, filled with oozing cheese and butter, topped with an extra helping of salty cheese. The exteriors have an amazingly addictive crispy character, while the insides taste like melted crack. I always root for the underdog; so on principle, I prefer her other variety: the arepa de choclo. It is much flatter and way sweeter than the regular arepa, made with monster choclo or sweet white corn, flattened and grilled like a crepe, only to be filled with a smattering of salted grated cheese.Both are amazing.

I even got a shot out on there a few times and they have also wrote messages on my personal page. Way to work the social networking game. That just makes me want to keep coming back and send business their way. They also have trivia on there and give away free food and t-shirts to whoever answers the question correctly first. facebook.com/profile.php… Hands down, this place has the best chicken wings I have ever had, I don't think ANYONE would be disappointed if you like wings.

1486,18,17,5.0,"I was blessed with a thick head of hair. Unfortunately said hair is extremely disobedient and resistant to styling. The most annoying thing is that it's neither perfectly straight nor voluminously wavy, which means if I just leave it after showering (which I usually do because I'm really lazy about my hair) it's just a big pile of blah. It was this laziness that prompted my decision to look into Japanese hair straightening (JHS). I figured that the JHS would save me the time and trouble of styling and would also ""flatten"" my hair so that it wouldn't need to be thinned out every time I got a haircut. I found JJ's Hair Salon through Angelina K.* who had followed her hair stylist, Melissa, from Cinderella Hair Castle to JJ's. According to Angelina, the quality of the perm has more to do with the stylist than the salon and since the the proof of her credibility is in her own perfectly straightened hair, I decided to trust her and make an appointment with Melissa.JJ's is Korean-run, but the stylists that worked on me spoke enough English that I didn't have any problems communicating with them. The salon is large and clean, with typical, trendy Asian salon decor. I appreciated the lockers they have in the back for you to put your belongings; the locker key is given to you on a stretchy wristband bracelet, spa-style. After the shampoo and head/neck massage that is customary with Asian hair salons, Melissa asked me a couple of questions about my hair (how often I blow dry and straighten it, whether or not it's colored, etc.) and answered the questions I had on the process before getting started. I decided to get a Brazilian Keratin Treatment** (BKT) in addition to the JHS***. While the JHS would thermally recondition my hair leaving it pin-straight, the BKT would hydrate my hair and counter the damage from the JHS leaving my hair smooth, soft, and shiny. I won't bore you with the details, but five hours later I had shiny, perfectly pin-straight hair. I admit that I had a nagging fear that my hair would go back to it's messy form after washing it, especially since I know how stubborn my hair can be. But after waiting the obligatory two days after a perm to wash my hair, it was still as straight as it was when I left the salon days ago. *whew* I can now vouch for Melissa's skill too. I plan on continuing to go to my trusted stylist at Sub-Image for haircuts, but Melissa's my girl when it comes to straightening treatments.*Thanks girl! :)**I got the standard BKT for $120, but if you want the highest quality keratin, it runs $200+.***$150 for any hair length.",26,-0.8943

What better day to have Southern comfort food than the first real scorcher of the season? The food was fresh and delicious with generous portions. Service was very prompt but maybe a tad too eager which is WAY better than a tad too anything else. I really like the decor here. It was cheerful and bright, a little retro, comfortable, and spacious. It pretty much looks how I would want my house to look but with beds and showers. And my house would definitely have the same bar. Gorgeous.--- the culinary nitty gritty ---Cocktails: - The Sazerack: delicious but a little on the sweet side for me.- The Hurricane: pretty much the best hurricane I've tasted, though I've only ever had them at one other place (Legends).Food:- Raw oysters: 6 Blue Points served with two different kinds of sauces. The first one was a refreshing minty sauce that, I'm sure, was refreshing but I don't love mint so...The pineapple salsa, on the other hand, was to. die. for. Spicy, smokey, sweet and tangy. *muah* So great! The salsa kinda stole the show but the the oysters were pretty dang good too -- a good size and nice and briny.- Grits three-ways (Cheesy, Porky, and Honey): Get this dish. I thought i had grits coming out of my ears and we were only able to eat about 2/3 of the order. My favorite was the honey (and not porky despite the bacon -- shocking, I know) because they were so smooth and creamy and sweet and heavenly and, and, and...*dies*- Sullivan Island Bog: Dirty things are good -- dirty words, dirty martinis, dirty jokes, dirty looks -- ok, maybe not that one unless you're giving them. This dish had dirty rice and it was pretty darn good. Scallop, shrimp (head on -- +10), and okra were the best parts for me. A bit al dente for me but I'm Asian and prefer my rice mushy and sticky. - Grouper: Only had a couple bites of this dish but it was pretty good! I thought it was a little sad that no spoon was provided for the yummy broth though. - Pecan pie a la mode: Plenty of pecans and not disgustingly sweet as some pies of this variety can be sometimes. The whipped cream was kinda foamy and I'm not sure if it was intentional or not. By the time we left, I was almost positive grits were spilling out of my ears and felt ready to walk to Brooklyn and back.

1488,19,11,5.0,"This is one of the BEST sushi places I have eaten at in NYC (so far...).I had to take care of some things in midtown and decided to stay in the area for dinner. A friend of mine let me be in charge of picking out a good Sushi spot. I turned to Yelp on my iPhone. It showed a lot of places, but this one had the best reviews and the photos were very enticing.They didn't lie. I made reservations and we were set for the night. Upon walking in you are greeted in a nicely decorated receiving area. There's complimentary M&Ms for you to nibble on by the door.I like how the guy calls the host upstairs and lets them know that i'm here. I wasn't sure if the sushi bar would be full so my reservations were for a table. While I wait they were setting up the table. I get the green light and make my way up. I am shown my table and immediately given a hot towel to freshen up. Now that's service.I skim through the menu and look around. Remembering from Yelp I already knew what I wanted. The ""Box of Dreams"" and the Sashimi Platter. My friend came and we decided to eat at the bar. They set up a new spot for us and we were good to go. Seeing how sushi is made is like seeing an artist paint a mural. It's an art form that takes a lot of skill.We sat in the front where the head chef was. He was really cool and recommended we get some Oysters. We ordered the Box of dreams and the platter. Seeing him slice and arrange the Sashimi in precision and perfection was amazing. He put a lot of detail into each piece.The oysters came and were phenomenal. They came in 4 pieces on a bed of assorted seaweed on shaved ice. Presentation was excellent. The flavors were amazing and a good mix. The oysters had a touch of Ponzu, green onion and some heat. After a squeeze of lemon it was in and down the hatch. One of the best oysters i've had in NYC.The Box of Dreams really looked like a dream. It's 9 boxes with bowls of white rice in each one. Each box had something different to offer. Toro, uni, ikura, ebi.... It was a real feast for the eyes. I'm a big fan of Uni and Ikura. I asked the chef if he can make me something that wasn't on the menu and he graciously said yes. (We are now BFFs) He made a special Uni & Ikura rolls for me. The perfect match with a hint of wasabi. You will not find wasabi paste here, but the real thing!The Sashimi Platter came and it looked too good enough to eat. After taking pics it was tasting time. There was an assortment of tuna accompanied by salmon, toro, mackerel, red snapper and scallops. The ones that stood out were the scallops and toro. They were really fresh and tasted good on it's own. No soy needed. The mackerel included the bones as a garnish and they deep fry it after your meal. With a shaving of rock salt. I'm not sure if they do that for everyone cause I didn't see it in any of the reviews. Awesome! This acted like a palette cleanser which made us ready for dessert.To finish off our meal we ordered some Mochi and Melon. The mochi arrived in 3 flavors. Mango, Green Tea and Strawberry. You can never go wrong with Mochi. It was arranged so perfectly and tasted very good. The melon was carefully cut and arranged in a very nice pattern. It was sweet and a great way to end a great meal.If you couldn't tell already by this review my dinner was awesome. I had no complaints whatsoever with the food.

1489,36,18,5.0,"Gu-Shine (Guxiang) has become my favorite Taiwanese restaurant in the five boroughs. Eating here brings me back to my visits to Taiwan where I had a little bit of everything from street food to home cooked meals. Every time I use Chinese car service, this place gets mentioned almost every time as a must eat in Flushing. And now their popularity is reaching epic levels, with lines out of the door during dinner on weekends along with accolades from various local publications. My hope is the popularity hasn't gone to their heads as I notice the prices are slowly rising each time I come out here. Their infamous two entrees + one soup deal has gone from $13 to $19 in less than two years. The owner and the staff, though friendly and hospitable, are becoming more stern to deal with the crowds. Being a longtime customer has it's perks, since I'm luckily in the good graces of the staff whenever they see me.Even at $19 for two entrees and a soup, the deal is solid. Portion sizes here are decent and the food is always very tasty. Favorites here include: sacha niurou (sacha beef), xia chao dan (shrimp scrambled eggs), chou doufu (stinky tofu), oo-a-chian (Taiwanese oyster pancake), sanbei ji (three cup chicken), and paigu fan (porkchop over rice). I also have had favorable results with their hongshao tofu (spicy tofu), mapo tofu, and shengjian bao (pan fried buns). Just typing all of these dishes already has me hungry.Those not wanting the popular entree + soup deal would be smart to order the small plates (xiao chi). That would include some of the food mentioned above, such as the oyster pancake or classic staple pork chop over rice. Each were about $5 last time I checked and both are outstanding.Beyond the price gripe, my only other issue is they often close too early. They won't take people in after 8:45PM at times because they'll want to close sometime between 9:15-9:30. I can only imagine how great this place would be as a late night spot, my taste buds along with many others in the area would never be more thankful.",51,0.9878

It's probably dangerous that it's 3 blocks from where I live, our trash can is always filled with empty blue and white Louie cups.

I want to shout it on a mountaintop, or, like Madonna in her ""Express Yourself"" music video, get on top of a giant statue and declare,""Don't go for second best baby,Put your love [of pizza] to the test,You know, you know, you've got to,Make [that trip to 60 Greenpoint Ave]..

A Paulie Gee's pizza is an ethereal, indescribable product of goodness. It's fior di latte cheese is dreamy, and creamy, it's crust, tender and bubbly (the consistency like that of delicious naan bread), and the whole of the pie, soft and crisp, flavorful with all the combinations via it's exotic and forward-reaching menu, but understated, well-balanced and even delicate. It is like eating art. Last night was a special night, and the boyfriend and I went to PG's for our fix since it has been quite a few months since our last visit. On this rainy evening in Brooklyn, the crowd swelled inside this dimly lit, rustic and casual pizzeria. Delightfully, we did not have to wait for a table and were seated immediately. I love their use of salvaged wood, and the attention to detail from the rustic ceiling to the back end of the restaurant where you will see heaven's gate, I mean, the ""Napoli""-branded oven where they churn out their amazing pizza pies. After a walk through the menu, we decided on two pies -- ""The Mootz"" (fior di latte, chopped fresh garlic, pecorino romano, olive oil, fresh basil and sea salt) with added, sweet Italian, fennel sausage, and the ""Cherry Jones"" (fior di latte, gorgonzola cheese, prosciutto di parma, dried bing cherries and orange blossom honey). I thought it was pure genius to temper the sweetness of the bing cherries with the prosciutto in order to prevent it from tasting like dessert. The saltiness of the ham added a much-appreciated level of savory to an already outstanding pie. As for the Mootz, I loved how the fresh leaves of basil, which were nicely tucked and melted into the cheese, had truly brought life to this pizza. The herbiness of the fragrant basil married perfectly with the generous chunks of fennel sausage. I noticed at the end of the meal, the 'soot', rather the remnants of charred crust that colored, and blackened my fingers, was an all too precious indication of my glorious time eating great pizza. We also had dessert which was fantastic. Two scoops of pistachio ice cream (I'm assuming Van Leeuwen), with a sweet and crunchy brittle. Incredible. Not one missed note, Paulie. I have been here on three separate occasions, and each time, Paulie Gee's outdoes itself. My pizza somehow gets better and better, my love for this place, blossoms to new heights. I know that there's a little place called DiFara's which is discussed with cult-like fervor amongst pizza connoisseurs, but Paulie Gee's is much more my speed and I have been to both places. The pizza is more refined. It is elevated pizza. Also, it is not as pricey, and the atmosphere is much more ideal. But to each their own. I will continue to cultivate my obsession with PG's and not be the least bit shy about it. I adore Paulie Gee's. Absolutely, completely, and utterly, phenomenal. I just... I can't even.",17,0.9993
1492,18,10,5.0,"Red Rooster is one of the hottest restaurants in town. A reservation 3 weeks in advance will still have you eating after 9pm, and even then you may get ""bumped"" by a celebrity patron. In our case, it was Questlove. In all honesty, these are not the kind of places that I am inclined to like very much, but this place offers up amazing food at a really affordable price, so like every mere mortal, I anxiously await my turn in the very long line to eat here. It really is worth the effort. The restaurant is small, and the space is nearly evenly divided between the animated bar up front and a choice collection of tables (some communal) in the rear all set before an open view kitchen. The bar doesn't require reservations, so it is considerably more crowded. The clientele are generally well-heeled, smartly dressed, and squarely middle-aged. The bartenders mix up an intriguing list of cocktails, that are delicious and worthy of attention. The eponymous ""Big Red Rooster"" ($14) was surprisingly smooth and astoundingly good. Who can error with cinnamon-infused bourbon? Add to that Dolin Rouge, Averna Amaro, and orange bitters, and you have an instant classic. Eventually we were called to our seats, and had a gander at the menu. It is notably short, but the selections are strong. We decided to begin with 2 appetizers: the oysters with ginger mignonette ($10) and the corn tacos and tostadas ($10). The oysters were fresh and delicious! Interestingly enough, they were served with a surprise vodka shooter which I have not encountered before. Better yet were the tacos and tostadas. They are quite small and easily managed with a mere two bites apiece, but what amazing bites! The yellowtail and salmon contained within were very fresh. It's strange, the preparations were conventional, but the taste was anything but. That is what is great about a skilled chef, able to make the most of every bite. Great texture and flavors throughout, leaving you wanting more. For the main course, I had the blackened catfish ($23). This was an exceptionally well crafted dish that was engaging on several levels and looked beautiful. The catfish had great color and texture and was well seasoned in such a way as to enhance the dish without obfuscation or dominance. It rested on a bed of black eyed peas that were mixed with celery root. Great idea. Another surprise? The use of fried pickles. I loved the delicate walk between comfort food and fine dining exemplified in this dish. The flavors harmonized, and it was simply a joy to eat. Clearly with this run-up, dessert could not be missed. So we decided to share the Black and White Mud ($8). Even this was amazing! Chocolate cookie crust, chocolate fudge, vanilla fudge coming together to make for a rather rich dessert. That much would have made it good, and perhaps forgettable. Garnish it with coarse sea salt and candied ginger, and it becomes wondrous. Honestly, my first bite registered a sweet, rich dessert, then there was a second wave with the salt coming through, and then two seconds later, that wow moment when my mind registered the dish as a whole. Oh my goodness, this is really quite good. How do you top an amazing meal with amazing cocktails? Well, Marcus Samuelsson himself came over and shook my hand and posed for a photo with my girlfriend. We also saw him actively working in the kitchen which is a rarity for known chefs these days. As good as it gets folks, reserve a table at your earliest opportunity. Strongly recommend.",18,0.9997
1493,24,18,5.0,"The realization that I would be awarding five Yelp stars to a Thai restaurant hit me before the arrival of the lychee sorbet. There's a special chapter of my personal philosophy devoted to Thai - chiefly, that every Thai resto in the city shares a kitchen, and that Thai food is best enjoyed from take-out boxes in the comfort of your own living room - in short, not a destination food.Kin Shop, though, is a destination - and I recommend you make it your next. The location on Sixth Avenue, sandwiched between bodegas and chain delis, is odd - particularly in contrast to its classy-hip interior: a beautiful bar, open-air kitchen, and cheerful decor.The food really carried the experience. Here was an instance where my (positive) memories of the service and ambiance were rendered irrelevant by the sheer and inarguable deliciousness of warm sugar-snaps and scallops, specked with toasted coconut and sesame and marinating in coconut cream sauce ($12), a savory and spicy masala tomato soup ($9), and rice noodles with rock shrimp that didn't taste anything like the Wondee Siams (in a good way!). Tables are meant to accommodate parties of 2-4; the vibe is a bit cafe for a proper date, but I'm excited to return with friends to sample the enticing cocktail list, as well as the remaining menu items.

That's 'S' words, Sean Connery.""A few ""S"" words come to mind when I think of La Biblioteca: sexy, swanky, seductive, sophisticated, swagger.Located below Zengo, this tequila library is a not so little gem that's partially hidden in Murray Hill. I feel very vulnerable that I just outed the location to one of my favorite bars I've been to so far in 2011. Don't come here! Okay, fine come here and drink lots of tequila because they have over 400 different kinds.They have happy hour Tues-Fri 5-7 PM -- 3 tacos for $5! I have to admit their tacos are pretty good. We tried the grilled mahi mahi and carne asada. Both scrumptious, small but tasty. We also ordered the ceviche and fresh guacamole as sides. The ceviche was an unpleasant surprise. It came out with a semi thick red sauce that looked and tasted similar to banana ketchup (filipino condiment). We tried to eat as much as we could but the flavors didn't go well with one another. The guacamole on the other hand was good, as well as the warmly, salted housemade tortilla chips that it came with.They used to have pork buns on the menu but it's been taken off. However, you can still order it as they offer it on Zengo's menu. They were okay, something was missing. Definitely not as good as Ippudo's pork buns. I did enjoy the cilantro and heat that I got in the first bite.Before I started my vertical tasting (progressively aged tequila from one distillery) of El Tesoro, I had the El Tamarindo (El Jimador Silver, tamarind, citrus, chile pequin salt). The one thing I enjoyed about this cocktail was that the tequila wasn't over powering and I was able to taste the tamarind as well as heat from the chile.If this is your first visit or any visit for that matter, I'd highly recommend trying one of the tasting flights. You're able to sample a variety of tequilas. For $16, I tried the vertical tasting of El Tesoro (recommendation from waitress) and was really pleased with how smooth the tequila was. I enjoyed the Resposado the most out of Blanco and Anejo.Feeling like a baller* and want to purchase a bottle of Tequila, Mezcal or Sotol? You can store your bottle here for up to 6 months in metal wired lockers that line the perimeter of the library. Very efficient and aesthetically appealing. The long wooden table in front of the bar gives off the impression that you're in a real library...aside from the bar, the loud guys talking about their lay last night, and an inebriated girl crawling on the floor looking for the bathroom. It's also just a really nice wooden table that I'd like to have in my future dining room.If only all libraries were like this one...a girl can dream.*If yes and true, call me.",18,0.9973
1495,24,16,5.0,"Once merely well-respected amongst many ""appetizing"" stores on the Lower East Side, Russ & Daughters now stands as the last of its kind, a beautiful anachronism, a temple to Jewishness that makes me want to genuflect whenever I enter, mixed religious symbolism be damned. There is little I can say about it that hasn't already been said 100 times in venues across the spectrum, from the food blogs to Martha Stewart, Calvin Trillin to Anthony Bourdain. But here I go anyway.Its narrow space stocks a dizzying array of foodstuffs -- herring to Swedish fish, eggplant salad Roumanian to Argentinian prunes -- but its offical blog's name, ""Lox Populi"", betrays its heart and soul: smoked salmon, twelve or so different kinds, all laid out in gorgeous slabs behind the glass-fronted countertops. To match, there are a variety of cream cheeses and, of course, bagels to put it all on.The last time I was there, I tiptoed my way through a motley assortment of old (at least three women in the store at any given time can easily be typecast as ""the nagging Jewish grandmother"") and young (yes, hipsters), sidling up to where the smoked fish lay. I examined each in turn even though I knew exactly what I was there for. Lost in my awe, I walked headlong into another buyer. ""Excuse me,"" I said.He gave me a look just long enough to be contemptuous, then called out, ""Yo, gaspe on an everything bagel with scallion cream cheese!""One amongst the phalanx of elderly men behind the counter sprang into motion. ""Eased into motion"" might be a better way of putting it, but I still couldn't figure out how it was decided which of them would act on the order. They all looked as if they had been there for decades -- maybe they had developed a functional telepathy for these matters. I could not see over the countertop, but even just watching his bust efficiently bob back and forth was mesmerizing. Swish, swish, swish, put it in a paper bag and there you go, pay up front.Then one of the Jewish grandmother-types behind me called out a sentence in what sounded like Yiddish, and another man quickly filled her order. Lining up per se was not the M.O. -- I had to assert myself soon or risk looking like an idiot. Or worse, a tourist.I tried to catch the eye of one of the counter-soldiers. ""Uh...""""Yeah?"" said a surly-looking man ten feet to his right.I pronounced the magic words: ""Pastrami lox.""""How much?""""Oh, on a bagel.""""What kind?""""Uhh..."" I hesitated. Obviously I hadn't been so prepared after all. ""...plain? With plain cream cheese?""And to my surprise, a half-smile appeared on his face. ""Always plain. Always."" My smoked-fishmonger, my bagel-butcher if you will, turned. ""Get me a plain, wouldya?!"" Scant seconds later, he was offering me a paper bag. ""Enjoy, boss.""I made it about a block away before deciding that I couldn't take the suspense anymore. I reached into the bag and extracted the treasure within. I was greeted by the smooth golden exterior of a perfectly boiled bagel bisected by a line of white cream cheese and a diffusely glistening layer of smoked salmon. It almost seemed a shame to want to destroy it.But it wasn't just any smoked salmon. Pastrami lox! Salmon cured in a similar blend of herbs and spices to that which gives pastrami its characteristic flavor. I had not heard of it until a few months prior, and when I did, I thought it sounded like a crime against nature. Yes, I liked smoked salmon, and I liked pastrami. But you didn't see me rushing out to try, say, baconnaise. The taste-test reviews of the pastrami lox, however, were uniformly orgiastic. So what if ""Russ"" had sold his soul to the devil for this unholy marriage of foodstuffs? Was there even a devil in Judaism?The round contours of the bagel were broken, I noticed, by a flap of the pastrami lox hanging free in the breeze. From this flap I took a bite.And here my words fail. How can I convey the shock of that first bite, the cognitive dissonance that accompanied that fugue of flavors? Buttery and salty and spicy and... My brain actually froze for a while, and when I came to, the only coherent thought I could form was, ""Well, hell, that *does* taste like pastrami and smoked salmon's love-child."" The overwhelming emotion, however, was one of gratitude.After all, if I have a family in NYC one day, this is one of my fantasies: strolling into Russ & Daughters on a sun-dappled morning with my own daughter, splitting a Super Heebster sandwich with her, surreptitiously giving her the smaller half, with a consternated ""DaaaAAD!!"" following, then sheepishly exchanging halves, and watching the unconscious smile work its way onto her face as she takes tiny but relentless bites of her bounty. To be able to connect with NYC's past in such a wonderfully vital fashion is a privilege, and one that I sincerely hope my hypothetical daughter will still be able to enjoy in a decade or two. I think she will.Probability of return within 1 year: 100%",17,0.9754

1498,9,20,5.0,"Whoa, a luchadore-themed Mexican restaurant? It's like God, or I guess a smaller, masked, more acrobatic, Mexican God, made this just for me. As if Mexican God said to me, ""Galvin, how would you like to eat delicious tacos in an establishment dedicated to the Mexican version of the hilarious carnival of sadness that is pro wrestling, which, like most foreign versions of stuff that's already pretty crazy, makes it totally batshit-insane crazy?"" And I was like, thanks Mexican God, you are now the best god, and I appreciate your creating La Lucha NYC from the raw essence of dreams I never dared to have, and I will go there right away.Now, even if you do not for whatever odd reason hold a similar weird morbid fascination for the spectacle of large sweaty dudes taking turns dominating each other while basically naked--let's not dwell too much on my own interest--there is no need to be put off or intimidated by this place. Believe it or not, the theme and decor here are relatively restrained, and, dare I say, tasteful. Sure, there's masks and weird shrines on the wall, but little of it at eye level, and it's not as if your server parades to your table with theme music or delivers all orders from the top rope. This isn't that kinda kitschy, gimmicky place. No, this is a Mexican wrestaurant (see what I did there) with CLASS. As for the food, well, I may not have grown up in California and every fifth phrase out of my mouth isn't ""fish taco,"" so I may not know from authenticity, but brother, these are some delicious tacos. After some delectable vegetarian (read: good but can only be so good) appetizers, I opted for ""Super Porky"" carnitas--as I knew I would from the moment I saw it on the menu, because, I mean, it's called ""Super Porky""--while my friend picked ""Dr. Wagner,"" the Mayan-style pork taco. (Of COURSE all the food is named after Mexican wrestling stars; as for the canonical reasoning behind an ostensibly German doctor becoming a Mexican wrestler who then later had a Mayan taco named after him in New York, your guess is as good as mine.) Super Porky did not disappoint, but food envy struck the instant my friend got his mouth around Dr. Wagner (this review: finally gay enough) and immediately proclaimed it one of the most awesome things he'd ever eaten. Now, we probably could've stopped there and been content--the tacos, though not huge, are definitely satisfying--but we enjoyed our food so much that I ignored my usual tightwad/small-portions leanings and called the waitress back over to order some more.At $4 a taco, I can understand complaints that the food here is overpriced, but well, we got a filling, super-delicious meal for $16 each with tax and tip included, which doesn't seem totally atypical of NYC pricing to me. Also, our bill came in a miniature wrestling ring complete with luchadore action figure, and because my friend and I are mentally 9 years old, we enjoyed making our little toy look like he was fighting with the wad of bills we used to pay. And well, if you want to slap a price on that, be my guest, but me and my friend will be over here with our correct priorities and our delicious tacos and our happiness and our fun little toy that we really wanted to steal but did not.Also of note is the owner's presence right here on his restaurant's review page on Yelp. Owner participation just doesn't happen enough on this site, and whenever Franklin M. comments on reviews of his business here, he always seems first and foremost genuinely appreciative of the patronage, and secondly, honest and gently informative when reviewers say something that is just plain off-base. The temptation to be a total dick when white people start telling you how your hometown ethnic cuisine is SUPPOSED to be must be just off-the-charts enraging, and I am just as impressed by Franklin's restraint as I am by his ideas for restaurants.So yeah, La Lucha NYC is my new favorite Mexican place, and would be even without the great theme. True, it's not like there are absolutely no complaints to be leveled against the place, such as the lack of liquor license (which I believe they're working on, but they should hurry up, because beer and tacos are simply two things that should happen together), and of course the whole endeavor would really be a lot more authentic if every six months or so one of the menu items died at a young age of drug-related causes.

I've also heard good things about the meatball and caramelized onion and the artichoke and shaved romano pizzas. But, the most important thing is the wine.

He quickly relocated everyone who wasn't there for me (hehe, birthdays are so self centered) and as more and more people arrived, we had ample room in the back patio area as well as inside at the back of the bar and back couch. There was a spot for everyone and the drinks kept flowing. People that wanted to smoke could, outdoors, without putting down their drink.

""What's not to love? The history, the arts, the food, the people... I mean just visualize the map of Europe and their neighboring countries, and then consider the Italians' complete lack of organization, and structure: they don't form a line, they cut into lanes, they are late for appointments, many believe death should precede taxes, they believe rules are optional, they are vocal and gesture a lot - there is an unfocused buzz of electrical energy all around. It's as if one had transplanted India into Europe""This was confirmed almost immediately as I asked the server for his recommendation in dessert. As I debated with him between the ricotta cheesecake (that he named) and the chocolate cake, he became speechless with emotion. Such was his conviction and passion that no words came out from his open mouth, till ultimately he shook his head and said: ""the best"". I don't know what was more priceless - his reaction, or the stunned look of my dining partner as she witnessed his raw, earnest emotion.The best. Truly. The best ricotta cheesecake in the city. Airy. Creamy. The best I've had in my life! Incomparable! Even better than a superlative version at Veniero's, as I thanked Jim U for his excellent review that drew my attention to Pepolino.Pepolino gets that reaction from many diners. Srini thought the Ribollita (Tuscan bread soup) was the best he had eaten, my earlier dining companions have had similar sentiment for the spinach souffle (with tomato coulis and parmesan), the veal & ricotta meatballs, the penne with pumpkin & fresh ricotta, etc. That said, not all dishes deliver a rapturous feeling with many doubts over the pasta dishes. Personally, I've loved the simple Pappardelle with tomato sauce and thyme, and the spinach and ricotta gnocchi - it would be safe to take a bet on anything with ricotta.For a ""secret restaurant"" Pepolino attracts its fair share of celebs, and even I have seen a few in my four visits here.

1504,12,7,5.0,"It's been 22 years. 22 years I've been desperate for a proper burger in the Bay Ridge area of Brooklyn. I understand that there's a sea of diners and other worldly restaurants out here, but none of them has ever served me a decent burger. Soggy buns, gritty patties, unmelted cheese; I've had it all.I was searching for a place to eat with a close-minded friend of mine. Burgers, I thought! Who in their right mind, vegetarians including, could turn down a decent burger. That's when I discover Burger Bistro. 4 1/2 stars on yelp you say? In Bay Ridge, for burgers? The closest thing to a decent burger here was the overpriced Five Guys, and their burgers are garbage. I had my doubts.Let me start with my first impressions. The dining area itself is small, and admittedly, lacks personality. Not much decor is on the walls aside from a few artsy-cutesy scribbles. And not many patrons were on hand either. But whatever, it was an early afternoon, many people were just getting off work at this time. We were sat quickly by a very pleasant waitress, and proceeded to order. Now, the way you order is a tad odd, but ingenious in a way where it frees up a waitress's workload. The menu is basically a check list. You have a choice of appetizers, and from there you can select the way you want your burger done, what toppings, what kind of bun, etc. A pastel type pen is provided for you to check off your choices on the menu. My friend and I both chose a beef burger with bacon, and a jalapeño-mayo sauce. I had my burger with smoked Gouda, and he had his with asiago. 15 minutes later, the burgers arrive, and the rest was history. Super juicy patty, equally soft bun; this was a quality burger my friend. The jalapeño-mayo sauce was seriously lacking kick, but never mind that, this burger deserves the full five stars based on the burger basics alone. It is a technical marvel. I've had many great burgers in Manhattan, but Burger Bistro can compete with just about any of them. Just because you're residing in Bay Ridge no longer means that you can't get a good burger. Well, I can say that now anyway.Additional notes*Even with the cheese($1), bacon topping($1), and sauce($1), the burger only came out to $9. That is a steal.",13,0.9853

But don't be fooled--these lima beans are so luscious, so meaty, they leave you wondering if you love them even more than that succulent, fleshy beast of a cephalopod arm swimming in sinfully garlicky butter.The churrasco steak, too, is charred perfection--exhibit A in the Museum of Carnivory--and topped with the bright herbs of the chimichurri, an unforgettable dish.If you dare to order the Chivito Completo, the sort of sandwich every burger in this city is lusting to grow up to be someday, you'll be rewarded with a smoldering hunk of sizzling filet mignon, a fried egg, mozzarella, bacon--so unless you're José Mujica, aka El Pepe, proceed at your own risk.In short, Tabaré is the kind of place that has you checking flights to Montevideo for dessert.",14,0.9859

1512,14,6,5.0,"This is a story of how everything happens for a reason. It was a rainy Friday night, and our other restaurant plans were thwarted by someone reserving the entire place. So the bf and I turned to Yelp. A quick look led us to this spot with a completely unprepossessing name and store front. The prices looked about average for Indian, so we headed in. As soon as we were seated, I asked the waiter to put in an order of veggie samosas for us (we were STARVING by that point), and then we started to browse the ample menu. The samosas came out quickly, and were delicious - perfectly crispy. After getting a couple of bites of food in our stomachs, we seemingly suddenly noticed that the decor was great - meant to evoke the walls of a timeworn street. Coupled with the warm, low lighting, it really works. Encouraged by the tastiness of the samosas, we ordered a bunch: a mango lassi, an order of garlic naan, chicken korma for me, and tikka masala for the bf. After we ordered and polished off the last bit of samosas, they brought out a complimentary basket of thin, crispy bread (likely usually a prelude to appetizers, but I appreciate that they obliged our hunger and brought out the samosas right away). Along with this free treat, the waiter brought out my mango lassi. And you know what? It was THE most delicious mango lassi. Ever. Perfectly smooth, a bit creamy and with just the right amount of cardomom. It was right around this point that my bf and I started saying ""I really like this place."" We were ready to say the big L word from the apps and lassi alone, but we were deliberately trying to temper our language, worried that the entrees might not be AS amazing. Fortunately, that concern was unfounded. Both of our curries were flavorful and well-portioned (we both had leftovers!) The naan was nicely fluffy and garlicky, and as soon as we finished the first lassi, we ordered another. And the L word started slipping out. The prompt and friendly service was the proverbial icing on the cake, and a glance at the check only made up happier. All that food, including the second lassi, was $50. We were stuffed and happy, and though it seemed like we were moving fast, were were unashamed to declare our feelings. We LOVE Curry Kitchen.",16,0.9954

The train ride to Cobble Hill had us regaling the amazing meal we had had the previous time, and our hungry stomachs ached to be filled with tasty bourbon and glorious meat products.We were seated at what we now call ""our table"" and silence feel. Not a usual occurrence as I tend to read aloud everything that looks good on the menu as I glance...ok stare...and comment at every plate that passes in view. Our mouth watered, and smells of great things to come brought smiles to our faces. The menu was a little different to reflect the season change since last we had stepped inside the doors at Char. No. 4, but I still wanted to sink my teeth into everything listed on the paper in front of me.The boyfriend was quick to ask our pleasant waiter what the specials were, both which we jumped on. He ordered the lamb loin with white beans, and I always being a dainty lady the signature bbq ribs with baked beans and corn bread.We started with the must have appetizers: Smoked and Fried Pork Nuggets that come with a side of a hot sauce. Which is the perfect compliment because of its sweet taste and its quick kick of spice. We also ordered (of course) the Crispy Fried Cheddar Curds with a side of a spicy pimento sauce, which they should bottle and sell.... I'd eat it on everything!As we threw appetizers in our mouth the conversation drifted onto the familiar topic of food, which was had only between the ""ohhs"", ""mmms"" and ""yumms"" of the pork nugget and cheese curd goodness. We conversed about the previous meal we had had at Char. No. 4, and although we knew our meal would be good we also knew it would never outdo the amazing choice I had picked last time we had dined here. You see on date nights I always win in the picking of the best dish category, and our first trip to Char. No. 4 may have been the best date meal I've ever had. I had ordered an appetizer salad and one of the specials. The most amazing pasta dish I have ever ordered, and the most amazing chefs special I have ever ordered: The gnocchi with a Boar Ragù. It was simply divine. I have dreams about it. I have nightmares that it may have all been a dream. It was simply one of the best things I've ever eaten. And back again for a second time at Char. No. 4 we waited for our main courses, while we order our second drinks. A play on an Arnold Palmer, and if I'd stuck to just one maybe I'd remember its name, but it doesn't really matter as all their bourbon cocktails are worth the trip alone. Or even better get a flight of bourbon, or scotch, or whisky, or be boring and stick with the typical dinner flare and get wine.As our plates hit the table we looked up at each other wide-eyed and bushy-tailed and once again silence feel, as we took our first bites. The BBQ sauce for the ribs had a perfect mix of sweet and spice, and the honey butter that comes on the side for the cornbread is another item I'd love to purchase from a shelf. The boy's lamb and white beans was much to salty and a little on the rare side for my taste, but all in all a fine choice. (Once again I won best dinner choice) We were stuffed and happy, but not as happy as we were once we ordered a dessert. The key-lime pie is scrumptious.

The patty is wrapped in Langos: a thin, fried dough that comes from Hungary. The result is a very moist burger without the ""distraction"" of the bun. I definitely had fun eating this thing!My Slav burger came with a side of halusky: thick, soft potato dumplings that substitute fries egregiously. I loved these little things: highly addictive!On a second visit, I opted for the spicy Hungarian goulash ($13): slow-cooked paprika beef brisket[2], pan-seared spatzle, sautéed onions, red peppers ($13). The goulash came in a wonderful sauce of a deep red color, with halusky on top.I loved the rich, unabashedly simple flavor of this dish. The addition of a spoonfool of cream on top thickened the sauce while adding a subtle but noticeable difference in texture.The is an interesting dynamics going on between Steve and Bernadette[3]: Steve experiments with dishes, and Bernadette gets to try them.Last time I was here, Steve was making hrutka: an egg-cheese and raisins dessert which is eaten for Easter. Eggs and milk are mixed in a double boiler until curds form, and then it is poured into cheesecloth with a weight on top until all the liquid has run off.To me it had a delicate taste similar to ricotta, just slightly more intense. According to Bernadette, there were too many raisins, but I thought it was light and wonderful. My only regret: not having the possibility to taste the finished product, which needed to rest in the fridge overnight[4].Steve and I had a shot of the strained liquid that was coming out of the hrutka (think egg nog). Steve was going to make an ice cream out of it. A wonderful idea, I thought[5].For drinks, I would recommend their Korzo Organic Ale: a very drinkable ale, amber in color, hoppy and with a crisp, bitter finish. And, at $4 a pint, a real steal! They also serve Zlat Baant ""Golden Pheasant"" Lager ($6); a Bohemian-style pilsner.Come here after 10pm, sit at the bar, and engage Steve and Bernadette in conversation.

1518,10,6,5.0,"There are quite a few successful Japanese restaurants in New York City that make you feel like you have stepped into Japan when you walk through the doors, but none more so than newcomer Cocoron in the Lower East Side. The treatment is so spot on, so friendly and welcoming, and the food so good that I cannot imagine why this place is not more crowded when I visit. Fine for me, but I want this place around a long time.Could soba be the trend of 2011? Surely it is worthy of such enthusiasm like ramen has acquired the past few years, but hopefully the quality remains high if new soba specialists open.There are many small plates to choose from to begin your meal, and we had a go at a few, the tastiest of which in my opinion was the Japanese coleslaw ($2.50), which used purple radish and a sesame dressing that you find in pre-meal salads. For a fried fix, try either the chicken ($3.50) or croquettes ($3.50), both tried and true methods of getting the taste buds on the path to happiness.But the most serious part of Cocoron is the soba itself, noodles which will warm your heart if they have done what they desire here. The shop's top soba and most expensive is the yuba soba ($13.00). ""Yuba"" is the tofu skins that you see to the left, and the dish is served with a hot dipping sauce.You can also use the same cold noodle to hot dipping sauce technique with the popular stamina soba ($8.80), or have a hot bowl with the oroshi ($8.50). This is fairly light and the title refers to the gooey grated daikon radish you see plopped on top.Be ready to get warned about the natto soba ($8.50) if you do not look like someone that has eaten it before. Natto is a fermented soybean and has a strong taste, but is really not something most people would object to. On cold soba and mixed with egg, soy, onions, and crushed sesame seeds, this dish is an amazing taste experience, sour and sweet and salty at the same time.Our group kept feeling curious despite our full bellies so we went ahead and ordered the black sesame cheesecake ($5) and yomogi mochi ($4). Neither was sweet at all and might disappoint the casual dessert eater, but the cheesecake was especially unique and enjoyable.One small point of advice though: make sure you sit at the counter.

1523,17,9,5.0,"As a reward for dogsitting my friends' two incredibly easy-to-care-for little dogs, my friends decided to treat me to a dinner at Good Fork. For about a month we tried to schedule a time when all three of us would be available, and finally we made it to the restaurant this past Sunday.We drove from Queens to Red Hook. This was the first time I've been to Red Hook, and what a random neighbourhood for a restaurant like this to be located. Walking in, we immediately transitioned from a quiet and empty-looking Brooklyn neighbourhood to a lively yet dimly lit and very cozy dining atmosphere. Our party of three was quickly ushered to a table in the back and handed menus. My friend had bought a Groupon for Good Fork, with which each of us would pick a starter, and main entree, a side, and a dessert. I love bitter greens, so for me, the roasted brussels sprouts was a no-brainer as a starter. On the main entree section of the menu, the apple-braised wild boar shank quickly caught my attention, but at first, I was unsure about the grits that would be a part of this dish. I do not like grits, but in the end I decided I needed to try this wild boar shank. I originally wanted to have the mashed potatoes for the side, but they had ran out already, and so I picked the onion rings.The roasted brussels sprouts came with a poached egg, serrano ham, arugula, and caesar dressing. Thinking about this dish as I write this review is actually making me hungry. The combination of ingredients in this dish made it absolutely amazing, and especially so because of the bitterness of the brussels sprouts and the saltiness of the serrano ham. The brussels sprouts were cooked to a nice and tender texture, and the serrano ham was cut into tiny slices and made almost crispy. The contrast between these two ingredients had me thinking that Chef Sohui Kim was a genius. Up next was the main entree of apple-braised wild boar shank. It came with smoked bacon, creamy grits, mustard green, and pickled apple, with the shank itself sitting in a bed of grits. I was naturally hesitant about the grits, but since I did order it, of course I was going to try it. And I had to admit that I actually liked it. It was very creamy and just a bit buttery, with a hint of pepper which really rounded out the flavour. The shank itself was incredible. The meat literally slid off the bone as I applied the slightest pressure to it. It was flavourful, satisfying, and meaty. I could not stop dipping the meat in the grits in order to eat both in the same bite. The side of onion rings was made with tempura flour, which made it a lot softer and milder than how it is usually made in most other restaurants. It was an interesting way of making onion rings which I had never tried before, and they were also very tasty. I topped off the dinner with a dessert of spiced pecan pie. While it wasn't the most amazing pecan pie I ever had, it was still very good and was just what I needed to further stuff myself after the extremely delicious dinner. I'm not sure when I'll be going back to Good Fork, since it's not subway accessible, but oh, you can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be back.",15,0.9942

My date -- who does not eat like a bird, thankfully -- and I decided to start with the scallion pancakes, which are topped with the most succulent shredded beef short rib meat I've ever consumed. We also had the Szechuan pork dumplings, which are served in a spicy chili-soy broth. YUM!Next came the broken chili chicken, which also carried a bit of a kick -- just enough to add some flavor and some spice, but not to the point of pain. What made it really memorable was the crispiness of the fried part on the outside combined with the juiciness of the meat and the spicy sauce. We also had the lobster fried rice, which was tasty probably the weakest dish that we had.

Bar seats were super comfy, Max worked the bar and couldn't have been nicer and the food blew us away. At one point, we thought we got our own version of Italian Boqueria on our very corner now. The small plates we had were the pecorino and some kind of a delicious salumi - fantastic. The olives we had were so meaty and flavorful I could have kept on eating them all night. My boyfriend got the bucatini Amatrciana I think and I went with the creamy pistachio and lemon tagliolini. My pasta was so rich but not too heavy, so full of flavor - completely up my alley as I am not a fan of red sauces.The menu is extensive and everything on it, sounded so amazing, I only kept wishing I went to Stuzzicheria earlier than 9pm to really indulge and pig out to the point someone can roll me up half a block to my front door. The place was busy, the staff was super friendly, the decor is quite nice and welcoming. I am looking forward to cominb back SOON to try the arancini, the meatballs, the sausage, the list goes on! I was too full last night but saw they had an orange olive oil cake I think it was - in retrospect I should have taken it to go. Welcome to the neighborhood, Stuzzicheria! Now, please consider outdoor seating. Ok, thanks!xo",13,0.9897
1529,18,7,5.0,"My boyfriend lured me into going to Red Hook and all it took was a nearly perfect sunny Saturday afternoon, a free ferry ride, lobster rolls and planting visions of sinking my teeth into some Grasshopper pie from Baked which is down the street from this place into my brain. SOLD!They made an appearance at the Parked food cart festival at Governor's Island last weekend and unfortunately, they ran out way before the event was over as did most of the trucks that were there that day. I vowed to try them out at their bricks and mortar location one day and this was definitely the day for that. For $15 you get a lobster roll that is loaded with fresh and juicy Maine lobster mixed with just the right amount of mayo on a bed of lettuce and a grilled buttered hot dog bun with Cape Cod potato chips and a fresh homemade dill pickle. This was complete with a Blueberry Maine Root Soda. We sat next door in the seating area after we ordered and picked up our food. Everything was made to order and amazingly delicious. The seating area is really no frills picnic tables that appear to be inside some type of small warehouse. They keep the area clean and do recycling of the bottles. If you are a fan of lobster rolls, this is the place to go. Highly recommended!",16,0.9798
1530,31,16,5.0,"I love checking out new restaurants in Astoria and it's surrounding neighborhoods so when Elle P. clued me in on Salt & Fat we made plans to have dinner there over the weekend. Salt & Fat had their grand opening on Friday so imagine our surprise to find that they already had a small crowd waiting for tables on their opening weekend. I guess good news travels fast. The space was very modest, just a small rectangular room with booth seating along one wall and tables for two along the other wall. The walkway down the center of the room was unnecessarily wide so I think there must be a way they can rearrange their tables to get more use out of their space. The decor was simple, clean, and minimalist.Salt & Fat offers a strong, substantial menu of seasonal small plates featuring a globally-influenced American style, bringing to mind a comparison to Traif, Brooklyn's favorite baby last year. When we were seated, our waitress brought us a complimentary starter of POPCORN in a little brown bag along with the menus. yelp.com/biz_photos/pZ9s… The popcorn is popped in bacon fat to give it a little something extra. Mmmm bacon...The two of us shared...YELLOWTAIL (with Italian speck, pickled jalapeño, citrus) - yelp.com/biz_photos/pZ9s… This dish was a great way to start the meal, very refreshing and light. I thought the prosciutto slightly overpowered the fish, so I preferred to pair the yellowtail with the pickled jalapeño and the prosciutto with the grapefruit. SCALLOPS (with roasted carrot purée, truffled golden beets) - yelp.com/biz_photos/pZ9s… I loved the combination of the buttery scallops, sweet carrot purée, and luscious veggies. The only flaw to this dish was that two out of the three scallops were just slightly overdone. BRAISED PORK BELLY TACOS (with pico de gallo, kimchi salsa, queso fresco) - yelp.com/biz_photos/pZ9s… All of the Asian fusion tacos I've previously eaten used a soft tortilla, but to my delight Salt & Fat's taco used a hard shell. Love it! The pork belly was perfectly braised and just fatty enough, and together with the accompanying fillings provided a flavor-packed mouthful. I was also happy to see more of the pickled jalapeño on the side.SHORT RIB BUNS (with pickled cucumber, apricot mustard) - yelp.com/biz_photos/pZ9s… Like the scallops dish, there was a small issue of one of the short ribs being slightly overdone. Other than that, the buns and fillings were very tasty and well-balanced though perhaps not as inspired as some of the other dishes.OXTAIL TERRINE (with caramelized onion purée, roasted mushrooms) - yelp.com/biz_photos/pZ9s… Out of all the yummy dishes we had, this one was my favorite. The oxtail terrine was succulent, and the onion purée had a lovely smokiness that brought out the nutty flavors of the shimeji mushrooms. Each bite was rich, savory bliss.LYCHEE PANNA COTTA (with plum vinegar gastrique, yuzu buttermilk sorbet) - yelp.com/biz_photos/pZ9s… The panna cotta was perfectly creamy. The lychee flavor was bright but not overpowering and went well with the mellow gastrique. The yuzu sorbet provided a welcome tartness though it was on the icy side.Sunnyside is lucky to have this new neighborhood gem. The restaurant was surprisingly on the ball for their third night. Dinner service ran smoothly and the servers were friendly and knowledgeable. Elle and I were especially impressed with their timing. Our dishes were brought to us one by one, the next dish following just minutes after the previous dish was taken away. The Chef de Cuisine (or was it our server?) even arranged our dishes from lightest to heaviest. Little bottles of Biofeel* yogurt drink came with the bill. yelp.com/biz_photos/pZ9s… I grew up with this stuff so I thought it was a cute, nostalgic way to leave one last good impression. I was really impressed and satisfied with Salt & Fat's creative, delicious, and beautifully-presented food. At last Queens has it's own ""Traif-like"" darling.

1531,29,8,5.0,"My Bucket List is probably a reflection of my Type A, perfectionist personality. Although I have scratched riding in a Ferrari off the list, I still have an onslaught of other important items, such as living in Spain, having my bachelorette party during Oktoberfest in Munich, skydiving, and eating at Le Bernardin.The Bucket List is one item shorter now because I had the honor (yes, it really is an honor) and pleasure of dining at Le Bernardin this past week. Deep down on the inside, I was hoping that Eric Ripert (swoon!) would be on location, but this just means that I am going to add ""Meet Eric Ripert at Le Bernardin"" onto my Bucket List.The service was incredible. I have never been so catered to in my entire life. From the person who greeted me at the door, to the sommelier that I chatted with regarding 2005 Bordeauxs, to the guy that pulls your chair out for you when he sees you returning from the ladies room...it's just special.And that was exactly how dinner at Le Bernardin was: special; one of those moments I will never forget. Deciding which menu to order from was a difficult decision. We opted for the Le Bernardin Tasting Menu, mainly because I can only eat so much (lesson learned from Moto) and I had my heart set on the black bass.After our wine was poured (a 2005 La Dame de Montrose Bordeaux that was amazing when poured, and only tasted even more of juicy, red fruits when allowed to breathe) and our bread selections were made (try the 7 grain!), it was time to begin.The amuse bouche was an oyster, in foam with tiny bits of mushroom. It was so aromatic, flavorful, and had me anticipating the rest of dinner. The courses, in order, are as follows:Thinly pounded yellowfin tuna, served over a toasted baguette. Oh - my - goodness. I didn't believe fish could be so thinly served in my entire life. It was extremely mild, but the shaved chives (which are symmetrically strewn on top of the fish) and olive oil provided a nice variation to this fish.Charred octopus, fermented black bean, pear sauce vierge, miso vinaigrette ink: The octopus used is from Spain and the kind you use for pulpo a la gallega. It was hard to believe I was eating octopus as I am so accostomed to toughness. The waiter poured the fermented black bean onto the octopus, which was sweet-smelling and the taste contrasted nicely with the tangy pear.Lobster carpaccio with hearts of palm: This lobster was so sweet, you could have served it to me for dessert. The hearts of palm were slivered in such a way that with each bite, there was a delicate crunch. The entire dish was dressed in a light butter sauce, which seemed very savory in comparison to how sweet the lobster was.Seared yellowtail with truffle risotto: When the waiter poured the truffle emulsion onto the yellowtail, I smelled the earthy aroma immediately. The tuna was firm, yet it just melted in my mouth. You will scoff at truffle oil after eating this dish.Black bass, beansprout ""risotto,"" and mini steamed buns: The firm black bass was a great contrast to the crunchy beansprouts and the fluffy, slightly spongy texture of the lup cheong (sausage) mini bun. What I loved about this fish is that it is a white firm flesh, but the taste is as delicate as a flounder. Was this dish everything I had hoped for and more? Yes.Our pre-dessert course was parsnip creme brulee with hazelnut. Personally, I loved the ""browned milk solids"" which gave a touch of bitterness to the sweet (yes, sweet) and tangy parsnip. Overall, the dish was also a wonderful play on textures.Milk chocolate parfait with liquid pear: Pear and chocolate is one of my favorite dessert combinations, so this was a real treat. The parfait has a very granular texture, and although this was milk (and not dark) chocolate, the gingersnap balanced the sweetness.Time for petit fours and coffee! We asked for French press coffee, and although it is not on the menu, one of the waiters more than happily brought it out to us (and it was delicious). I could have eaten an entire tray of the little tart-like petit fours (the second in the photo).This was one of the stand-out meals of my life. It was a surreal experience for me to actually be dining here and makes me feel so grateful for the things that I have.If you asked me to pick a favorite course, I really could not pick one. Honestly, I couldn't even rank each of them - that's how incredible and unique each plate was. Le Bernardin deserves every one of its three Michelin stars and I hope that everyone, at some point, has the opportunity to dine here.",36,0.9988
1532,14,9,5.0,"Review dedication... Catherine ""Hot Sauce"" J! Without her splendid suggestion on Wine 30, one would not have been privy to an elegant and well balanced glass of Barolo under the lights of a diminutive yet enchanting atmosphere...The Setting: Despite its petite nature and assembly, the view from the outer confines of Wine 30 reveals an opulent story. The subtle, yet sensual atmospheric feel of the establishment embodies the first major principle in such a venue. A little note on Wine 30, the ""30"" is derived from the number of seating available at the restaurant; this includes both the bar and table seating. Entry into Wine 30 will reveal the modest space of this institution to be both warm, and vibrant. From the constant activity in the viewable kitchen, to the low key and laid back feel of all attending patrons, the wine bar itself produces a harmonic beat and relaxing experience. Seating at the bar area provides ample spacing for attendees to move freely, without interrupting guests in adjacent seating. All of the tables in the establishment provide an excellent view of the entire establishment, while embodying the natural light derived from the outer confines and tranquil surroundings of the Murray Hill neighborhood.The Service: Needless to say, the service at Wine 30 is directly indicative of the hospitable feel of the establishment. From first entry, a simplistic greeting with a smile, followed by an elegant & graceful address by the attending bartender set the foundation for the evening's endeavors. On more than 4 to 5 occasions, my water glass was refilled without request. The bartender was also careful in their selection of my second wine choice, which did not disappoint (as I rendered the responsibility to the attending bartender based on my ""strict preferences""). During the course of the evening, a request to change seating to a more view friendly area of the bar was embraced and granted without refrain. Such notable hospitality should set the foundation for how service should be rendered at all other wine bar establishments.The Wine:2004 Cantina Terra del Barolo ($16.00) - Despite its youthful complexity and age, the intricacies of the 2004 Cantina Terra del Barolo did not disappoint. The ripe flavors of grape and oak are presented throughout each sip of the wine with each additional sip enhancing the structure of both the bold burgundy body and the hints of oak present through the aging process. The best way to truly classify this remarkable wine is to identify both its bold and deep complexity. Although the finish itself possessed a clean to the tongue touch (thus indicating its age), the overall flavor profile ranging from the mild oaky taste to the complex muskiness allowed for this Barolo to be a true every day consumable.Barbera d' Asti ($13.00) - Given that this was the ""surprise"" wine of the evening, it was nothing short of a spectacular selection. With the label hidden and no physically similar wine bottle in sight, it was up to judging this wine by taste and taste alone! A proper aromatic test of the wine indicated hints of tobacco / smokiness, which was accompanied by a well balanced dryness. At first taste, a notable presence of acidity and spice was detected. With a medium bodily structure in terms of the complexity of the wine, the main flavor profiles of the consumable were established. The guess... ""Barbera d' Asti""! With a quaint smile and obligatory acknowledgment, my bartender had confirmed the response. Unfortunately, no prizes were awarded as I was still stuck with having to pay for the wine.8:00pm in the evening with 2 glasses of classic Italian Reds consumed, it was off to dinner. With its splendid interior features and cordial staff, there's very little doubt that a return trip to Wine 30 is all but certain. Perhaps snacking will be in order for the next visit.Notes on Wine 30:1) Edibles ranging from Cheese & Charcuterie options to Sliders w/ Gruyere are available for snacking.2) Per glass wine selections range from $8 to $16.3) Not in the mood for wine? Wine 30 offers Palm from the draft, along with numerous other bottled beers.4) Suggested Seating: At the bar! Leave yourself to the attending care of the bartender.",18,0.9874
1533,23,12,5.0,"For years, I did not like macarons because the cute little sweet dessert sandwiches looked adorable and delicious, but whenever I bit in the inevitable disappointment of the brittleness of the crust and lackluster center. And yet disappointment after disappointment, I kept ordering because 1) I must not have learned my lesson the first (or second, third, etc) time around and 2) I couldn't get over the incongruity of the look and taste, and figured someone somewhere must make a macaron that actually tasted like how it looked -- pure deliciousness!Thank goodness for my eternal optimism, otherwise, I would have never given La Maison du Macaron a try some years ago. I wasn't living here then. I was visiting on a work trip. I had a few hours to spare and spent a delightful afternoon mindlessly wandering up and down the streets with no agenda in mind and I found myself in front of Madeleine (as it was known back then). Once again the sweet little cookies beckoned to me. I succumbed even though I had mentally resigned myself to disappointment.But one bite proved me oh-so-wrong. THIS WAS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. My eyes widened and I immediately went back and bought more.You see, all the other macarons I had were old and stale. Sitting around, getting drier and staler as they sat prettily in glass jars or counters. But at La Maison, the macarons are ALWAYS FRESH. The sandwich part is supposed to be soft and tender, not crunchy and brittle. The center filling is always smooth, creamy, fragrant, and utterly seductive.They're beautiful little jewels of epicurean delight! It doesn't matter which flavor you get, they're all incredible and I've never been disappointed or saddened by these. I've eaten macarons up and down Manhattan and I haven't found a better macaron than the ones here.",28,0.9626
1534,17,28,5.0,"The first thing I do when I enter my apartment is put my keys on my bookshelf. At eye level so I can always see them. I do this because I once left my keys in my lock overnight and have since been scared straight. Or so I thought. (Or so I thought that I thought... you'll get that later).The evening before my birthday I got home late and while chatting on the phone I put my keys in their usual spot. Or so I thought. (Please see above.) The next morning, on my birthday, feeling special and loved by all the birthday love, I got dolled up and was on my way to work, with extra mascara on because I would be meeting up with my friends afterwork for some celebratory cocktails. I put on my coat, scarf, hat, mitten (just the left one) and reached for my keys with my unmittened hand but...they... weren't... THERE! I looked around for an hour and couldn't find them. I then realized that I could have left them in the door overnight and opened the door hoping that they'd be there and they weren't. So my next logical thought was that a ghost had taken them and hid them because that's what poltergeists do right? Now I'm never eating chicken in my apt again or using my bathroom sink! (Please see: youtube.com/watch?v=QsMC…) Eventually I calmed down and decided that an old lady in my building took my keys and is now waiting to steal my stuff. What a jerk. So I basically go on this rampage of hiding all of my stuff (some of which I still cannot find) and leave for work. Stressed out about not being able to find my keys, with my apartment completely turned upside down, having spoken to a locksmith that wanted to charge me ""starting at $150 for a cylinder"" (a $20 cylinder) and my super being on vacation, I head out for work 3 hours late. On my way to the train station my supervisor texts me and tells me not to go and enjoy my day off. Cool. Bam! I look up and there's the BX Alehouse. And it's opened and I need a drink. I sit at the bar and with tears in my eyes tell the bartender that I'm having a rough morning and it's my birthday and it's not fair and I can't find my keys and I needadrinkandIhateverythingbecauseanoldladyisgoing­torobme.. and he gives me a shot and a beer. And I feel better. Then I start to swap birthday drama stories with this guy at the bar and I realized just how much I love this place.It's not a neighborhood bar in the usual definition.

1535,15,5,5.0,"It's shame that I only recently discovered this place six years after I use to work one block away for nearly 4 and 1/2 years. But the universe smile down upon me in the form of a Yelp deal and I was finally afforded this chance meeting with Hatsuhana. I couldn't resist the $40 for $80 worth of food that was being offered as a discount, so I came here with 3 others, fully aware that I would probably have to shell out to a bit more to compensate for the rest of the bill however much that would amount to at the end of our meal. If not for Yelp, I would have never come here since I've never heard of this place in the foodie circle. I've heard of other infamous sushi restaurants (Sushi Yasuda, which I have also been to), but never Hatsuhana. Yet, I was comforted in knowing that this restaurant has been around since 1976 and the 4+ star Yelp aggregate review really set some high expectations for my first time here. Let me sum up my experience by saying that not only did Hatsuhana blow me away, but I will be bold enough to say that I even think it is better than Sushi Yasuda. I am not exaggerating when I say that this was a completely impeccable dinner. The food was outstanding, the service was on-point, and we were all wildly impressed. We ordered four appetizers to share (""Aburi Toro"" - lightly seared fatty tuna slices served with a hearty garlic soy sauce, ""Agedashi Tofu"" - deep fried tofu in a soy sauce based broth, served with ground ginger radish garnish, ""Lobster Tempura"" - a half tail of lobster fried in tempura batter, and their japanese style calamari). There was not one thing about any of these dishes I could critique. The tuna was buttery and cool, fresh and utterly amazing bathed in that garlic soy. The age tofu, though fried, was soft and pillow-y, and it's skin, salty and sweet, was so delicious, I had never tasted anything like it before. The lobster tempura and calamari were both delicately fried, the tempura batter was crispy and did not taste heavy at all. Spectacular. As for my entree, I passed on the popular ""box of dreams"", fearing it would be a bit too much, instead I ordered their Chirashi (an assortment of sliced raw fish fillets and other delicacies served on a bed of sushi rice in a bowl). I have had fantastic Chirashi at other sushi restaurants. Most notably at Sushi Yasuda, but Hatsuhana's was remarkably fresh(er), and the presentation was so gorgeous, I almost did not want to dig into it. I truly appreciated the attention to detail where even the wedges of sweet egg were branded with the restaurant's name, ""Hatsuhana"" on it's side. This meal made me smile as I ate the best Chirashi I have ever had anywhere. We didn't try any of their desserts as I had brought a box of Levain's notoriously monstrous cookies as a great way to end our meal. As we were chomping down on our cookies, the waiter actually brought us dessert plates so that we would look less like savages devouring our sweet confections. I thought that was oddly gracious, and spoke of their professionalism and kindness. Before leaving, I had been so stunned by how great and fresh the food was, that I had felt compelled to order a number of rolls to take to my boyfriend who was working late and unable to join us. As soon as I met him, I told him to get started on the rolls, and as he began eating them (spicy scallop, salmon skin, yellowtail), he said, ""wow, this fish is so fresh.. it's remarkable"", and all I could do was agree with full enthusiasm. I can't wait to become a regular at Hatsuhana. They have a great pre-fixe menu, if you are dining on a budget. An excellent meal at Hatsuhana does not have to cost you and arm and leg. But even if it is more expensive than what you'd prefer, trust that you are going to have an extraordinary meal with the freshest and most delicious ingredients, rendering you utterly satisfied.",28,0.9993
1536,28,24,5.0,"Hands down, the best breakfast in the city! What's the catch? Oh, there's many. Shopsin's is kind of notorious in Manhattan. The ""soup nazi"" from Seinfeld fame looks like a cuddly teddy bear, compared to the staff here. Really though, I don't find the staff to be unreasonable. They simply want you to show respect for their business and for them personally. If you can contain your personality enough to do that, you will be rewarded with an absolutely amazing breakfast. If you can't, you may literally be kicked out of the restaurant. No joke. During our visit, we counted two offenders. The first was a lady who was standing in line for the adjacent cheese shop and took it upon herself to grab a chair from Shopsin's to have a seat while she was waiting for her cheese. Now think about that for a moment. There are only 8 chairs out on the main floor for the entire restaurant. She walked into the restaurant and took one of them. What reaction would that garner from any restaurant owner? Of course they yelled at her that it was their chair that she was taking. She wasn't even a customer! Another gentleman walked in and took a seat, put down his stuff on the adjacent seat, and told the waiter that he will just have a coffee to start and that he was waiting for his friends to show up. The waiter explained that he will need to wait for his friends to show up first before he can be seated and, further, he would have to wait by the wall until he was directed to take a table. The guy then said, oh, ""I was lying. It's just me. I am going to eat by myself "" to which the waiter said, ""well, I can't serve you then since you lied to me"". The guy became huffy and walked off in disbelief. He didn't respect the fact that he needed to wait in order to be seated, and that he couldn't be seated until his entire party arrived. Heck, these are the rules at Olive Garden -- what is so difficult to follow here? Again, just show respect, and you will be fine. Be an impatient, pushy, entitled (lying) jerk, and earn the wrath you are due. So if you can survive actually acquiring a table, then you are in for a true reward. The menu is crazy large, and you can't possibly know what to order. The answer is simple enough, though -- anything! Seriously, everything is good here. You can't mess up. It's idiot-proof!I began with the ""crisp hash, eggs, and toast"" breakfast special ($16) which I took with the ""Mexi"" option which includes chicken, chorizo, and hatch. What an amazing hash!! (note the double exclamation points). The texture of the potatoes was simply perfect, so crisp and yet flavorful. Folded into the mix, I really enjoyed the spicy chorizo and the assertiveness of the hatch (a Mexican chile). For a dish that you would expect to be pretty heavy, it wasn't that way at all. A great balance of flavors that had me eating more than I could have thought possible (I finished the very large portion with nary a moment of hesitation). Additionally, my choice of scrambled eggs was nicely done, softer than I usually encounter.  For dessert, if you will, we went with the ebelskivers ($10)! I was first introduced to these delights in Solvang, CA. I was taken with them at first sight, but I never realized that they could be improved upon. By far, these were the best ebelskivers I have ever had. The airiness quality in them is something else. Our bowl housed 7 of these heavenly bodies all surrounding a central cup filled with freshly made schlag. Take one, dip it into that creamy goodness, bite, and savor the moment. What a perfect way to cap any meal!         Given that huge menu, I so want to come back here again and again and try just about everything else. The prices are on the high end for breakfast, but the quality of the food absolutely merits it. Just make sure you are on your best manners when you go. A little bit of humility in life will reward you richly. Enjoy.",31,0.9981

1539,14,18,5.0,"I have a T-shirt depicting a pig. Delicious parts of the animal are colored red, nondelicious parts green. The entire pig is red.Being ethnically Filipino means that this shirt merely restates an axiom of my existence. Filipinos love pigs -- a love that involves slitting their throats, bleeding them to death, sticking poles through their mouthes and anuses, and spit-roasting them for hours. No less a luminary than Anthony Bourdain has deemed Filipino ""lechon"" the world's finest preparation of pork. Thus, I have high standards for my pig preps. It usually takes a thermonuclear bomb to move me to rhapsody about a pork dish, and there aren't Ippudos on every corner, so.There aren't Fatty 'Cues on every corner, either.Let's get this straight: America is better off that there aren't. The menu is, ahem, unapologetic. A side of Pullman toast comes with ""Master fat,"" a promising phrase if I ever saw one. It turns out to be like Jewish-style schmaltz raised to the nth degree: drippings from every single species that goes through the restaurant's smoker, which by my count is seven. I mean, if I have to convince you of the appeal of dipping soft white bread toast into a ramekin of seven-animal liquified fat, then I doubt you should be going to Fatty 'Cue.That'd be a shame. You'd miss out on the amuse-bouche we got, a delectable swirl of clams, bacon, and ""bone broth"" served in a soup spoon and chased with, ha, a vermouth shot. We quickly followed that with the red-curry-rubbed duck, the meat a touch chewy but blissfully smoky. Here Zak Pelaccio's Asian-crazy palate yielded clear dividends, crisp skin yielding to juicy fat like a best-of-breed Cantonese roast duck. Included curry and rice seemed perfunctory, but a bedding of pickled daikon provided a cleansing touch.All these were undercards to the main event, the whole reason I'd dragged my convive, a 5'9"" slender wisp of a woman with an enviable stomach capacity, out to Williamsburg. You see, every Sunday, Fatty 'Cue smokes an entire pig, and I don't mean a suckling one. It's a huge f***er of a sow, chopped up and served in chunks. Except, I'd heard you could reserve specific parts of the pig, which I'd done the day before.So when I heard someone in the kitchen shout, ""The pig's head is a GO!"", I knew we were in for a world of pork.Words can hardly describe the experience of getting half a huge pig's head laid in front of you in a single piece. ""Epic"" will have to do. It. Was. Epic. The pig's head had been neatly sliced in half as if by katana, the inner side a lesson in cross-sectional anatomy. I pointed out parts to my convive as I stuffed them into my mouth. ""This is the soft palate, mmrrph. Tonsils, omnomnom. Pterygoid muscle, chumph. Eyeball...""I'll get back to the eyeball.Meanwhile, on the outer side, the skin glistened invitingly, but herein lay the pig's only major flaw: unlike the heavenly skin of Filipino lechon, the hide here was tough. Flavorful and orgiastically smoky, yes, but better suited for gnawing than swallowing. I still sucked on the ear hungrily, though. Removal of the skin revealed a layer of subcutaneous fat both titillating and terrifying -- we scraped most of it off onto a designated Fat Plate, but I couldn't help sneaking the occasional lipid globule into my mouth anyway.Under the fat? The meat of the cheek. Oh, glorious pork cheek! The meat's softness was gradated, transitioning from pillowy tender and juicy at the top of the jaw to are-you-sure-this-isn't-pure-fat-too succulent near the snout. This is where my convive concentrated her attack, ripping away tendril after tendril of evanescent protein faster than even I could handle. Deep to the facial muscle fibers was mastication muscle tissue, more actively used and thus less fatty. Nonetheless, it was analogous to a chicken's dark meat, with slow-twitch muscle fibers giving it a different texture that was no less wondrous.Anyway, the eyeball. I ripped it out of the socket like that scene in Kill Bill 2, and it came out cleanly, trailing orbital fat and a segment of the optic nerve. (The optic nerve!) It looked disconcertingly like a human eyeball, a fact that did not dissuade me in the least from sucking out its smoke-touched vitreous humor, then swallowing the remaining corneal/retinal/neural complex whole.All this came with perfectly steamed bao, a chili-infused vinegar sauce, and a smattering of radishes and cucumbers. This nod to Peking duck is the sole Asian gesture in the dish, but if I haven't made this clear already, THE PIG'S HEAD STOOD ON ITS OWN. Otherwise my convive and I wouldn't have fingered the various orifices in its skull for as long as we did, trying to scoop out every last bit of muscle, of cartilage, of lymph node. Truly an experience to remember. The naysayers who claim to be carnivores yet can resist this pig's jowls? Your meat-eating cards should be revoked immediately.Probability of return within 1 year: 10%, for health reasons",19,0.9911

Well.. after dinner, we ended up getting sidetracked by something shiny (or rather by hunting for something sweet - dessert!). As we coincidentally passed by, she literally stopped mid-sentence, pointed at the store, and exclaimed, ""Side tangent. There's that shop I was telling you about!"" I'm not sure how loud she was or if it was just fate, but the employee inside must have either saw or heard us from across the street. He waved us over to come inside. Seeing as how it was meant to be, we decided to pop in for a quick look.The employees were both very happy and super helpful.

A trip to Hahm Ji Bach in Murray Hill (Queens) is a hassle unless you have a car but it is well worth the trek on the LIRR, bus, or by foot. Do not let any distance, rain, sleet or snow hold you back from coming here. Please do not bring any vegetarians or non pork eaters with you. The inability to participate in gobs of meat and the epic Sam Gyup Sal will only cheapen the Hahm Ji Bach experience.Sam Gyup Sal. What is it? It is pork belly and the only pork belly I'm willing to eat the fat of. Sam Gyup Sal makes Peter Luger bacon look like weak sauce. The ""bacon"" at Hahm Ji Bach is bigger, meatier, badder, tastier, and more wonderful in every way. I was supposed to hold the bacon up to my face to show for scale for my friend in Texas but the waitress cut it into pieces once it was cooked. If you thought Luger bacon was big, the ""bacon"" at Hahm Ji Bach is the size of a record lengthwise. Oh it's thick too.Sam Gyup Sal is the real Korean taco. Forget those food trucks or standing in line at the Hester Street Fair. We wrapped the Sam Gyup Sal in a radish ""tortilla"" but not without dipping it first in the sauce, crushed peanuts, bean paste, and topping it with perilla leaves. I think I had seven. I could have eaten it all night so much that I neglected the bulgogi, kalbi, and spicy pork. The bulgogi was sweet and a little lacking in color. The kalbi was like thicker steak and the spicy pork still tasted raw to me. It wasn't very spicy either. I would pass on that one. We also got complimentary beef and cabbage soup. It was delicious and tasted like something your mom (or my mom, well actually my grandma) would cook at home.The service is excellent at Hahm Ji Bach and great for groups. I had a table of 14 and we got the secret room downstairs. It is a great space for a private party and almost felt like we were in a house. The really nice waitresses warned us not to get too many sides because the banchan would be plentiful but we couldn't have a Korean dinner without seafood pancake and Japchae. It was so good and since our tables were filled to the brim, they served everything to us on our plates.We got a lot of different banchan than what I am used to. I didn't get to try all of them as the dinner was quite overwhelming but the gigantic block of tofu and giant cucumber slathered in kimchee was amazing.As we talked about Red Mango and Quickly bubble tea for dessert our prayers for a palate cleanser and something sweet was answered. We got carved pineapple and icy bowl shots of pumpkin. My friend spiked it with soju. That may have been the way to go but without it was just fine. It's actually a very interesting and refreshing dessert. It tastes more like corn or mango (shush!) but when they told us it was pumpkin, I could taste how it had that squashy flavor.Hahm Ji Bach is the best Korean restaurant I've ever been to.

It arguably started with a close win in Top Chef S1, punctuated by a unmistakable success in Perilla, and recently rekindled with the opening of Kin Shop in the West Village. While Kin Shop didn't have the flash and pomp as a Michael White or Jonathon Benno opening, it's a terrific addition to a New York restaurant scene that's in sore need of upscale, yet honest Thai Food.The decor and scene is muted, bordering on boring but without an ounce of pretension. The most exciting visual element is the open air kitchen at the rear of the restaurant, where a lucky few customers eating the at the bar can watch the cooks at work. Service is casual and efficient.We've seen flashes of brilliance in the subtle Thai flavors at Perilla, and now we get the full thing at Kin Shop. The curry sauce accompanying a starter of bay scallops was so good, I was left awkwardly clawing at the plate with my fork to scrape up the last puddle of sauce. A side of preserved watercress & mustard greens was assertively spicy and bold, though unbearably pungent. Despite a multi-toothbrush and mouthwash circuit, the stench of preserved greens was recriminate on my breath.The real star of the show was a Massaman goat curry. The slowly braised goat neck was fork tender and impossibly fragrant - a truly noble end for our goaty friend. A sliced duck breast is simply paired with fresh herbs and is meant to be placed in a pocket of crispy roti and drizzled with a red curry. An absolutely superb bite of food.

1544,23,17,5.0,"Minetta Tavern, with its' impressive reputation, seems out of place as it is located in the middle of an area of MacDougal Street better known for it's bar scene and fast food joints. The unassuming exterior with it's black curtained windows hides a dimly lit tavern with a sense of history. Surprisingly, for a restaurant of this caliber, the interior feels very cramped... and I mean that in a ""hey, I am seated right next to a stranger from the table next to me a mere foot and a half away"" kind of way. They were packing in the customers like sardines in there to make use of every inch of space available. Not that big a deal if the person sitting at the next table is a pretty girl (or handsome guy if that floats your boat more) but not so great if it's a sweaty fat dude.  If you want a private romantic date, this is not the place to be.Despite how they cram people into it's space, getting a table is pretty hard. Be prepared to book up to a month in advance.  If you don't want to wait that long to try out their menu, you could always scrap the idea of eating at the table and dine at the bar instead. I've read that you could get any of the food from the menu there anyway.Minetta Tavern is well known for their black label burger and that was what my dining companion and I ordered. The burger patty is a blend of dry aged rib eye, NY strip, skirt steak, and brisket. The meat was rich, beefy tasting, soft and perfectly medium rare in the center as I had ordered. The exterior of the beef patty also have this nice crispy, charred coating to it that gives it a nice contrasting texture with each bite. The burger comes with lettuce, tomatoes, and a generous helping of caramelized onions sandwiched between a soft bun. There is an option to add cheese to the burger but the burger is rich enough without it. Besides, you are already paying $26 for this incredible burger, how much more expensive do you want to make it? Along with the burger, the plate came with a crispy pickle slice and a large pile of fries. The fries are cut shoe string style and reminds me of the best fries that McDonald's made before they changed their recipe to be more health conscious. Normally comparing something to McDonald's is an insult akin to ""ha ha, your food tastes like crap"" but for this, I consider it high praise.As a side dish, we also ordered the bone marrow. This came with 3 large halves of bones split down the middle to get to the marrow in the center. The marrow, when combined with the crispy bread and sharp, sweet shallot spread was decadently rich and flavorful. In terms of the 3 high end bone marrows that I have tried in NYC, I would rate Blue Ribbon's with it's amazing oxtail spread in first place, this in second, and Landmarc's as third. Would I pay $26 for this burger again? Yes I would but maybe only once or so a year. It's not exactly cheap you know.

At the same time, the contrarian in me is quick to pooh pooh the latest chart buster as ephemeral and a momentary aberration. This was thus a double whammy, for I could find no fault with Lula's: Decadent flavors, wholly natural and organic philosophy, quality ingredients, retro décor, warm, patient, and gracious service - simply flawless.

1549,48,30,5.0,"When someone or something is extraordinary in Spain we use to say ""is de pata negra!!"" ... there is no better Spanish compliment than this because nothing is as good as the best ham in Earth: Iberico, which is made from pigs belonging to the Iberian race. Those pigs are black (negro) or at least their nails are, and as you know, ham is the hind legs (pata) salted and cured for months hanging down over the cellar under specific temperature and humidity conditions. And between, the longer it hangs, the better will render.. getting old is always good.. And yes, in case you hear it before, pata also refers to a female duck but it means leg too when talking about animals, but not for humans, be careful with this. And when those pigs run free in the field and they are feed with acorn only during the months previous to the slaughtering, then, only then, is when we have the best of the best .. ""De Pata (leg) Negra (black)"" ... Happy pigs will always arise the most delightful ham* At Pata Negra you can certainly taste the best of the best and this place is extraordinary not only because the ham served but for their tapas as well. All this is served in a quiet ambiance of modern elegance and good taste focus is small details. Ideal for a date and a group of friends but not bigger than 6 if you wanna stay in the same table. The ham section includes different types of Spanish Ham and is ideally to share. From Serrano, which is the most popular Spanish ham, made from white pigs and the one you have probably taste before; and although its not de Pata negra, and therefore its less expensive, don't get me wrong, Spanish ham is always delicious. But the main attraction is many types of Ibericos served as well as their combination plates with other types of cured meats. Our Pata Negra plate for $40** imported from Spain, were said its a 3 and a half years old. Older than the joint itself. Older than the time Iberico has been available in USA*. The slices were served over a wood chopping table, beautifully glowing in fat, tender, flavorful, thin and served at room temperature. Just as it must be...and with many bread slices soaked in olive oil and spread with tomato purée as a side, or what you will recognize as the popular Pan tomaca, a featured tapa, even breakfast dish, from Catalonia. When iberico, I like to enjoy my ham alone but I also recommend to put one slice over a pan tomaca and eat it together.. that combination is just magical. We couldn't help, but keep ordering from this section. Friends said that they just wanted to compare ham types ... yes, sure. The Extremadura plate ($27) was again extremely good. Slices of Iberico ham, Manchego cheese, chorizo and coppa (this is Italian cured meat by the way) and pan tomaca of course. Plenty. Flavorful. So good. This is how we roll with pork in Spain but this is NY and not even my loved Socarrat serves a ham plate like this ones I have to say. The cheese section is not extensive but the ones offered are a great selection. Its served with green apple slices, raisins and nut bread and a fig-olive oil paste. A large serving size for $5 each. The Manchego that I tasted was really good, because not all the manchegos are the same.. again timing is important and like with wine, ham .. and even humans, no?.. the older the better. The Patitas section refers to toasted bread slices with different toppings. Its also known as tosta and our mini-version of what you know as open sandwich. One order will give you 4 for $5, but as we were 5 people we got the degustation plate ($7) that include one of each kind. 5 in total. The quince and goat cheese that I tried was like the one I always have back at home. We also order Pan tomaca that was a bigger version of the side served with the ham but just as delicious .. omg. I just always die with this when is done right. And Pulpo a la gallega (octopus with paprika) ... and it was so good that we had to order it again. There is only a few options for vegetarians, including the cheese, quince patita, tortilla, pan tomaca, asparagus and shiitake with eggs, and we were advertise that everything with meat was meat pork. Even their logo is a pig .. a cute pig... its not this a loud call for pork lovers?We ended up being also like happy pigs. Really full and well feed with the best of best. At $40 each in total. Drinking a glass of house wine for $5 because the ""siesta time"" was still happening (from 5pm to 7pm every day and you must mention it) and treated like at home ... or what its home for me. Like in Spain. It couldn't be more authentic in all the senses. And thinking about it.. did you also hear the rumors about yelp wanna update their type of compliments? just saying... ""de pata negra"" it would be an awesome one. *en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja…** Just as a side note, the acorn ham is priced upwards of $96 a pound, those are some of the most expensive hams in the world.",49,0.9995

I have to admit the whole predicament took me by surprise, though now, as I re-evaluate, it all makes perfect sense. I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing in her situation. Let me get to the details. I brought these oversized, fabled chunky chocolate chip cookies of wonder over to my dad's house to enliven the mood last Father's Day. Unsure of a good gift, I heeded the old cliche ""the best way to a man's heart is through his stomach."" I was sure I brought a gift that would give to the entire household, however, i soon realized that my master plan went awry. When we sat down for dessert, I mentioned the lore surrounding the Levain Bakery cookies. People looked at me like I was a bit of a city snob (I was in Jersey) and that I should shut my mouth about this ho-hum chocolate chips that claim to be ""the best in the city.""  However, the tide soon changed when the first young child broke a piece of the cookie off to test the waters and call my bluff publicly at the table. His eyes opened wider, his smile inched broader across his face. His small child's hand reached to break yet another chunk of cookie. People got competitive. More hands - small and large alike were reaching for oatmeal, for chocolate chunk, for peanut butter chip and more. I was happy. ""Christina, you did good,"" I told myself. ""See, now they know you're not a snob foodie bragging about special chocolate chip cookies from the CITY. You put your money where your mouth is. Or they put their mouths where your money was. Whatever. Success. Yezzz."" And then. I heard my step mom's voice crack the silence, break through the chewing, mute the ""Ohh wow, these really are the best cookies I've ever had,"" elatedly expressed by my step mom's own mother!!!""No one touched my cake,"" she sadly blurted out. I stopped chewing and I looked at my step mom's melancholy face. The facts were true. Her home made Duncan Hines vanilla cake with chocolate icing was in virgin territory and all of us, with our chocolate guzzling gluttony , could do nothing to help. None of the kids would step forward. My dad had overdosed on chocolate chips. Even her own mother refused a slice of the homemade cake. I felt eyes glaring at me. Oh Lord, what had I done??

I tried to take my time and get something really awesome, but I couldn't wait another moment to order. People all around me were drinking out of coconuts, vases and copper tin cups. I told the bartender to hurry up and make me a #77 (Monticristo Spiced, coconut, cardamom, passion fruit) and you know it came in it's very own coconut shell complete with a little umbrella and a small plastic stand so I didn't have to hold it all night. I almost lost it with excitement. I started sipping it slowly, but might as well have opened up my gullet and poured it right down there. It was really good. The type of good where when it's finished, you want to cry. You can't get to the bar fast enough for another one. Luckily, at that time we were seated at our table and then I got even more excited. Are you wondering how that's possible? Okay, here's how. We ordered the #480 (Pitu, spiced passion fruit, muddled ginger) and it arrived in a massive vase (planter might be more accurate) with orchids floating on top and a lime that was on fire as the icing on the proverbial cake. 5 oversized straws later and we guzzled it right down. I AM SO HAPPY REMEMBERING THIS. Moving right along....The food was just as outstanding as the drinks, which surprised me. I shared the coconut shrimp with another in my party to start and it was perfect. I don't know how else to describe it. It had this sauce that somehow had Mediterranean, Malaysian, Hawaiian flavors all rolled into one tiny dish and once again, my ladylike manners disappeared. I had to have every last morsel. As a main course I ordered the Dover Sole and it was a rather large piece of fish, covered in almonds and lemon. It was fresh and tasty, but at this point I was so full of booze I had to stop eating.

Style ""J"" is more straight forward with a slight angle upwards.STEP FOURYou rest on the treatment bed and your eye lids are tape up to reach the base of the eye lashes. Glue is applied and your chosen style ""curler"" is applied. Another pad is placed on your lower eye.STEP FIVEThe lashes are glued to the ""curler"" and the perm solution is applied. The wait time is about 15 minutes.STEP SIXThe perm solution is removed and a conditioner solution is applied. Another 15 minutes.STEP SEVENThe conditioner solution is removed and the lashes are removed from the ""curler.""  The glue is wiped off and your lashes are now done.STEP EIGHTA clear solution is applied to seal the perm - and whoa.... you're batting your eyelashes every moment you can.My one advise is for those that wear contacts, take rewetting drops with you to rinse your contacts or bring a container to take them out.  When I finally opened my eyes, everything was a blur and it took 10 minutes for my contacts to flush out and see clearly again. When I could finally see again - I saw how beautiful my lashes turned out. I will be returning again and am already a huge fan of eye lash perm!ps..bring your headset and listen to some musicpps..ask Kiki about happy hour rates",22,0.9944

All you dumpling monsters from Chowhound, rest assured; Best North lives on!They specialize in Dong Bei (northern Chinese) food, which is a regional cuisine that has lately been snagging the spotlight and garnering a cult following -- I could totally picture this homestyle kitchen snuggled away in a nook right by the other northern Chinese vendors at the underground Golden Shopping Mall. I recommend the fennel & pork dumplings. Also good, the ""Aquatic Food, Green Pepper & Pickled Cabbage Vegetable, Celery Dumpling,"" which I bought wholesale and frozen. Apparently 'aquatic food' translates as 'san xian,' which I assumed is meant to resemble the 'di san xian' of Dong Bei cuisine (however, I don't taste any potato or eggplant [how that is ""aquatic"" is beyond me]. If I'm not mistaken, I taste pork and leek, haha). If you know something, please enlighten me.The only thing I wish they had is an original sauce to accompany the dumplings; nevertheless, they taste great with soy sauce and some chili sauce. The frozen dumplings are excellent; they don't crack in the freezer or explode or spill their contents when you boil them!10 pieces boiled-to-order set you back $3-4, 15 pieces $4-5.

In the heat of the moment, you've got to reach into your purse, search frantically for it, and spend minutes ripping open the packet...and that can kill the moment. I'm sure we've all been there.I decided to just go for it, so I had an unprotected cheesy encounter last night. I'm paying for it today, but boy was it worth it! The cheesy encounter I'm referencing is the famed spinach gnocchi in a gorgonzola cream sauce. It wasn't even the dish I ordered-I ordered my gnocchi with tomato sauce because I wanted to be good. But my friend had to taunt me by ordering the dish the way it's supposed to be...and I found myself sneaking forkfuls every time she wasn't looking.It reminded me of the best gnocchi dish I've ever had (until last night, anyhow), at a red-sauce Italian place called Luigi's in Anaheim. The gnocchi there was covered in alfredo sauce, so it was a bit heavier, and the gnocchi at Malatesta were a bit fluffier, maybe because they were made with spinach. They literally melted in your mouth, but they were served so piping hot that the first few bites didn't have time to melt before I had to swallow them!My other friend ordered the fettuccine with meat sauce, and it was excellent as well. Not heavy, but still hearty. I kept stealing bites of his as well, but the clear winner at the table with the gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce. This place was CHEAP for what you're getting-the entrees were all around $14, which is a steal for this neighborhood and the portion size! The bottle of wine we ordered was the best Pinot Grigio I've ever had (Kossler, I think it was), but it was around $40. We asked the bartenders if the cheaper one (which was around $30) would be a decent option and they assured us that the extra ten bucks would be worth it. And it was! It was silky smooth and just a hint of sweetness, making for easy drinking.The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bread because it had rosemary in it and I can't stand rosemary (food poisoning incident a while back that I still haven't gotten over), and they served the bread on a small plate and didn't bring another plate for oil/vinegar. Most places bring each person their own plate, so it's a good thing I was with friends who I didn't mind sharing with!The wait wasn't bad either. On a Saturday night at 9:30, three of us only had to wait about 15 minutes. They let us squeeze in to the ""bar"" area where we ordered our bottle of wine and chilled until we got our table. It's a great neighborhood and setting for people watching, and they have all of the walls open to the outside. Definitely a great place to come with friends or a date! Highly recommend it.",15,0.9976
1560,20,9,5.0,"During daylight hours, it is a bit hard to see into this restaurant, and even identifying it is a bit difficult, as the Russian sign and ""Elza Fancy Food, Corp."" are not the best clues for non-Russian speakers. Don't be timid though, open the door and find the wonderful name of this place right on the top of the menus.The place is very nondescript, with plain peach walls, a very high-mounted HD television set playing Russian talk shows, and no decoration. Only Russian is heard within the confines, Korean women are in the kitchen, and Uzbek food is on the menu. Only in New York. Actually, it is not so hard to fathom with a little history lesson. Even today Koreans are immigrating to Uzbekistan since the country already has a sizable population since Koreans were forcibly deported here from Far East Russia back in the early 1900's.Needless to say, the food has many influences, with Korean and Russian brushes adding to the palate. The kaksu ($5.50) is a cold (surprise!) soup of lamb and pickled cucumbers. It was refreshing and crisp for a hot day, and made our order of the cucumbers side ($3.99/lb) unnecessary, as the tastes are the same.We were eager to dig into the delicious manti ($6.99), steamed lamb dumplings that are served with dill and a dollop of sour cream. We also could not resist the plov ($6.50), another staple of Uzbek cuisine. While the dish will never blow your mind, this version is very good with fatty meat chunks and lots of grease.The samsa ($2.50) also proved irresistible, despite not really having room for it. The flaky pastry feel apart nicely and was filled with the same delicious ground lamb that was found inside the manti.We were really all smiles after visiting your mother-in-law, and cannot wait to see her again on the next visit to Brighton Beach.

They do serve your average bbq-- kalbi, bulgogi, samgyupsal-- but what makes this place special is their ssam bab. Ssam is basically when you make a wrap for yourself (for lack of a better description). The wraps are made from any kind of leafy greens-- not just the lettuce they serve at most Korean restaurants. At jumakgol, they give you a variety of greens-- different types of lettuce-- romaine, red oak leaf lettuce, bitter tango lettuce-- with sesame leaves, and other greens which I do not know English names for. It's served with your choice of meat or grilled fish. The grilled fish is toasted to perfection-- and when you sprinkle the juice of a lemon over it it gives it a nice zest on top of eliminating any negative fishiness that you might experience. They also give you denjang-jjigae (soup made with fermented soybeans) and ganden-jang (a really thick soup made with fermented soybeans). The latter is very savory and you use it flavor your ssams.

I almost wanted to weep that I had to return to my home in Manhattan because I know how far I am from my dear love Tanoreen. I've tried so many Middle Eastern restaurants in my life (In the US only), and it's one of my favorite cuisines in the world, and this one is a cut above the rest. Someone told me on yelp that the chef/owner is Palestinian if you want to know from what region in the Middle East. Not only is everything moderately priced, but everything is also PLENTIFUL and tastes outstanding.I kinda had a hunch that this place would be great, but the moment I tried one of the appetizer specials, the hunch became reality. I selected the mhammara appetizer which is not on the menu but was on the daily specials. It looked like a heterogenous concoction of love. I'm not exactly sure of all the constituents of this God-like substance, but I do know at least that it had red bell peppers, lemon, tanoreen spices, walnuts, and corn. I was having the time of my life spreading this thing all over soft and crunchy pitas that they brought us. For the entree, I had what I consider a quintessential barometer of the quality of a Middle Eastern establishment: the kafta platter. When it came, I was nonplussed to tell you the truth because they were very generous on portion size. The plate looked like a masterpiece. The middle had the ground lamb, the rice, and the veggies, and the plate was surrounded on the perimeter by tabouleh. The whole combination of side dishes and main entree hit the spot in a way no Manhattan restaurant has done to me yet. I'm sick of walking around Manhattan and seeing such pretentious, elegant, and flamboyant foods. When I came here, I felt like I wasn't being cheated at all--that I was just getting quality food that's all synchronized into a beautiful symphony, and at honest prices. Also, the service is above reproach. It was perfect, actually. I called ahead to make reservations and when I arrived, they greeted me by name and continued to greet me by name until I left.

There would only be pizza margherita, no other toppings, and only slices. I would eat a slice of this wonderful pizza while sitting by the sidewalk overlooking the sea, a Ceres in my hand, while watching the sun slowly sink in the sea, and thinking in amazement that Africa was the closest land, somewhere away on the horizon.I love pizza. Pizza is one of the simplest and most unpretentious things you can sink your teeth into. So why, oh, why is it so hard to find a half decent pizza in NYC?You've got to love the story behind this place: Mark Iacono opened Lucali to save the local candy store of his Carroll Gardens youth from becoming a Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts. You can still see relics of the candy store hanging from the exposed brick walls. The space is large, simple, and welcoming, with a wonderful tin ceiling, and the pizza-making area right in the middle, on plain sight.As soon as our pizza arrived, I could already tell it was a winner. The smell was not only wonderful, but you could smell every singe ingredient distinctly: the basil, the milky mozzarella and, most of all, the tomato sauce. The crust is thin and crispy, as it should be, slightly charred and blistery, with a wonderful, simple taste. This pizza was so wonderfully delicious and simple that trying to describe it in more words would just be a disservice to Mark Iacono.We came here on a Saturday night at 7 pm, and there was a 45 minutes wait[1].

The difference being you won't see potato salad, turkey wings or smothered pork chops on the menu. You will see bacon topping fried green tomatoes and sweet corn and black eye peas salad.While the chicken is the star, Peaches HotHouse really excels at being a great restaurant.

Albeit it is a little small, they make due with what they have.I had the daily special: ""Trust Me."" Below is a list of some of the notable pieces I had. The TWO STARS of the show:Tuna and Toro (tuna from the belly) - After diving into this set, I became speechless. My friend,, concerned, asked what was wrong and well, I was overwhelmed.

I needed a moment to myself to collect myself to savor every grain of rice, every part of the fish.THAT is how good it was, and I don't know if I can ever be as happy ever again. (Unless of course, I get it again.) Blue Crab Handroll: This is a simple, cylindrical handroll that is packed with rice and hearty chunks of delicious, fresh, 100% crab. It is not to be taken lightly. The quality of this piece is quite high and deserves its place in the omakase order - saving the best for last. Honorable Mentions:Octopus, Abalone, Orange Clam - My friend's mother thought the abalone was amazing. My friend thought the orange clam was delicious. I thought the firmness of the octopus was the most notable. Chances are, you too, will find some serendipity in this plate. Salmon with Kelp - Fresh and distinguished, dressed with a rectangular piece of kelp and sesame seeds. Most of his sushi is presented with simple elegance, that is minimal garnishes and sauce. I like this because it doesn't distract you from the experience of the fish. Yellow tail Belly - Yellow tail, traditionally very firm, shows its soft side here. From the belly of the fish, it is transformed into a buttery masterpiece. Orange Clam, Giant Clam, Scallop - Beware of the clams! My sinuses were immediately cleared after stuffing each in my mouth. The spicy surprise definitely jarred me awake. Scallops were fresh, soft, and delicious! Total Damage was $275 for 2 including tax and tip.

I made a reservation thorough Yelp's link on the Il Buco review site. HUZZAH!!!!2. There are only 4-5 tables for two people, if that. Even if you request them, there's no guarantee you'll get them. So you kinda have to be okay with dining very close to strangers at a long table for six.3. Do not bother with the on-line menu. This special restaurant has a beautiful menu that changes daily. Everything changes - the appetizers, the pasta dishes, the main courses, everything. 4. Look up. The light fixtures are works of art, every one of them. My favorite is the bronze lamp consisting of 3 teapots, each pouring out light. And look around. Wooden bookshelves are stocked with bottles of olive oil and sea salt. I challenge you to find the painting of an old man sticking his tongue out at you. It's quite amusing.5. This is NOT the place to be on a diet!!!! Order something fabulous - smoked prosciutto lasagna, a steak unlike any you've ever had, unheard ingredient combinations that will have you wriggling in your seat in anticipation. This is also not the place to be thrifty - do it up, and do it right!!6. Confer with the sommelier.

My date and I went to Kanoyama on a Sunday night so there was no wait for a table. Kanoyama has very minimalistic (i.e almost nonexistent) decor, but the ambrosial seafood and attentive service more than made up for the lack in ambience.Kanoyama has an extensive raw bar menu with 10+ types of oysters to choose from. We decided to start with with two KUMAMOTO OYSTERS each. The kumamoto oysters were on the sweeter side so they were divine when paired with the lightly tart ponzu sauce and a little lemon.yelp.com/biz_photos/VVlH…For an entree we shared the SASHIMI DELUXE (3 pieces each of 6 kinds of fish)yelp.com/biz_photos/VVlH…and the OMAKASE SASHIMI (2 pieces each of the day's best 9 kinds of fish)yelp.com/biz_photos/VVlH… To my delight, the only overlap was the yellowtail. The deluxe had all the standards that you'd expect: tuna, salmon, yellowtail, fluke, etc. The omakase sashimi boasts of the best fish of the day and included red snapper, kinki (thornhead), white tuna, sockeye salmon, and more that I can't remember the names of. I was in sashimi heaven. All were extremely fresh and I got to try some types of fish that I've never had before. My favorite was the sockeye salmon which is a darker orange than regular salmon, and is slightly more firm and slightly less fatty than regular salmon. So delicious! Also interesting to note is that the white tuna we received in the omakase sashimi didn't look like the white tuna I'm used to; it was pale pink as opposed to the pure white fish that I expected. And the texture was fleshier than the spongy yet buttery white tuna I'd had in the past. I did a little research on the topic and found that what Kanoyama served is the true white tuna. The opaque white fish that a lot of other restaurants serve as ""white tuna"" is actually another fish called escolar**.If you like wasabi, I recommend getting an order of their fresh grated wasabi on the side to pair with your sushi/sashimi. Compared with the wasabi that usually comes with sushi/sashimi, I found it to be sweeter with less of a bite but much more flavorful. To fully appreciate the fresh wasabi, I recommend spreading it directly onto your sushi/sashimi instead of mixing it into soy sauce.I was a little disappointed that neither the deluxe sashimi nor the omakase sashimi came with uni so we ended the meal with an add-on order of UNI SASHIMI. Like everything else we had, the uni was extremely fresh. The flavor was very clear and bold, and it literally melted in my mouth.yelp.com/biz_photos/VVlH…My experience at Kanoyama was outstanding and I'll definitely be back. Thank you sushi-gods!**Food for thought: Apparently there is a lot of controversy around escolar because while delicious (and inexpensive), consumption of large portions of escolar is bad for the gastrointestinal system. Escolar isn't banned in the U.S. but the FDA recommends only having escolar in portions smaller than 6 oz.",26,0.9985
1575,13,9,5.0,"I discovered this place during the recent arts festival in DUMBO. We were walking around and checking out galleries and studios that were open to public and happened to walk by this wonderful place. Something just caught my eye. There was a huge globe by the entrance. It was old but very well kept or perhaps restored. Now If I could show you how my ideal place would look like, I'd point you to areas of this store. It's a mix of old and new with different textures and lines.. splash of odd items here and there. I want a vintage globe or five. And I want reclaimed wood with huge casters as coffee table. And I want old maps as artwork. Maybe an eames egg rocking chair too while we're at it? Ahhhh this place was total eye candy for me.Some of their bigger pieces like the coffee table were reasonably priced. I knew for certain if I saw this in the city they would sell for twice as much. They also have smaller home items perfect as gifts, some mens shirt and bags. I'm definitely coming back for more eyecandy. Find out more about this store that is also a studio for interior design, architecture, graphic design, etc. Check out the website!P.S. their business card is of high quality. That alone impressed me.P.P.S. every 1st Thursdays they offer free design consultation.",15,0.9916

I say that, mainly because I'm really not a huge fan of lobster.But I know this is a quality place. (I've eaten here years ago when they first opened)So even though I expected NOT to love this place, I ended up loving it all over again.Are we thoroughly confused now?On snowy nights like this, that nice calm warm feeling washes over you, while so many people are out enjoying the city.  People are almost forced into slow motion. Something just makes you want to run home and watch re-runs of Taxi.That sets the tone when you order your nice glass of $12 Pinot Noir.(this place isn't exactly cheap) (the market price of the Lobster roll was priced at $27 tonight)Lots of great, and varied Oysters. (not a wide selection of West coast though tonight, which I usually prefer)Nice, friendly and prompt service.My daily special appetizer of John Antipasto for $12 included Baked clams, shrimp scampi and peppers was absolutely amazing!  The clams had just enough breadcrumbs as to not make them gagging dry. The shrimp were really just perfect, and perfectly flavored, and the thinly sliced peppers, were salted to perfection.  (See pics)My other daily special of Penne w broccoli rabe $15.  (a very nice offering of Lobster meatballs over linguini I passed on $23, but seemed intriguing.)Anyway, long story short, the Penne was undercooked, and my waiter didn't charge me for that.It had good flavor (a little salty), just a hair spicy, with what looked like a little bit of crushed red pepper, and the broccoli rabe was very good, with thinly sliced garlic cloves that would make Pauly from Goodfella's the movie proud.  Overall, the appetizer and the courtesy and professionalism of the staff was really what won me over.I will be back.",20,0.9927
1577,15,8,5.0,"Not all Lan Zhou Hand Pulled Noodle shops are created equal.Perhaps it was by coincidence that a venture to Lan Zhou was conducted. After all, it was lunch hour and the technicians at Lexus were nowhere close to done with the repair to my vehicle. After wandering a few blocks on 8th Avenue, I stumbled upon Lan Zhou and thought... ""Why not give it another shot?""Setting: There's not much that can be said about the establishment. The entire restaurant is a little smaller than 500 square feet. The seating area is limited to only about 7 (maybe 8 generously) individuals. There is one large main table that can seat about 3 to 4 with other wall seating fitting about another 3 to 4 customers. The restaurant itself is somewhat dingy. Nevertheless, most ""hole-in-the-wall"" type restaurants fall into this stereotype. After all, patrons that frequent Noodle Shops know that we're here for the food, not for the top notch decor.The Food:Beef w/ Hand Pulled Noodle: Compared to the Lan Zhou of East Broadway section in Chinatown, the most notable observatory difference is that this location offers a larger serving of protein. With about 8 slices of Beef weighing about 2.5 to 3.0 ounces, patrons can be certain that this Lan Zhou won't be skimping on the ingredients. The beef itself was on the firmer side, but still possessing a proper balance of fat and carefully broken down connective tissue that made the beef enjoyable to consume. As for the noodle, brilliantly cooked and perfected! Each savory and scrumptious bite had with it the classic buttery smooth texture of the noodle while embodying a slight heartiness when chewed. The noodles possessed a slightly doughy texture, but certainly not one that was burdensome. Both elements combined to create a simplistic yet perfectly executed rendition of the classic Hand Pulled Noodle application.$4.50 is a slight price to pay for brilliance. Then again, $4.50 is a slight price paid for lunch compared to other notable establishments.Needless to say, I know where to go in Brooklyn for a Hand Pulled Noodle fix!Notes on Lan Zhou:1) Owners of this establishment speak Cantonese!2) Prices range from $4.00 to $6.00 for a bowl of Noodles. With an order of dumplings, you're still under $10.00.3) Restaurant itself is cramped. The best seating is at the main table. Take the seat closets to the walls away from the register.4) Don't spend more than 10 minutes eating, you're seat is being eyed by patrons looking to have lunch.5) Cash Only! Who pays for Hand Pulled Noodles with plastic?",17,0.9946
1578,30,25,5.0,"Do you believe in love at first sight? Me? Not really, but it happened to me last night. I fell in love with Tabaré the moment I saw the store front. Located in hidden part of Williamsburg South 1st street, it appeared like should've been placed in West Village. When my friend suggested to have a dinner at Tabaré, her friends' only two month old restaurant, I only imagined a little tiny typical Williamgsburg eatery. Then I met these Uruguayan Diego and Ramiro, the owners of Tabaré and realized that this is not only what I didn't expect but also it's someone's dream coming true. This place is gorgeous. I love the every detail of this place and I'd rather want to shop here. Tabaré is Diego and Ramiro's first restaurant and they built this place from ground up, all by themselves. Every little pieces in this place are hand picked and crafted by them. Ebayed lamps and wood panels from everywhere and the concrete molded & hand painted table tops. Everything here has the story. Modern and elegantly stylish but natural. Artfully patched woodwork of the walls and some ceiling are just lovely, not to mentioned the rustic brick walls. The whole place is designed being playful with a lot of textures. It is a true artistry in the heart of Williamsburg and it looks like it should be featured in one of those interior design magazine. But most of all, I simply couldn't believe how everything looks so professional and well finished. Rare talent discovered here. In fact, I heard that Diego decorated Shakira's NYC apartment but he isn't interior designer. You go Diego! Now, the real business - the food! I have no idea about Uruguayan cuisine FYI.Anyways, I am not a big fan of empanadas but this home made empanada ($6) with caramelized onion & cheese rocked my world. It came out with two seasoned oilive oil dipping sauces (one spicy and the other with parsley) and it just melted in my mouth. My Civito Sandwich with Traditional Uruguay skirt steak ($14) was so tender and juicy. The dripping juice was well worth licking. The came with fries were also excellente perfecto. My friend had the beets salad ($9), which was refreshing. We got some complimentary chocolate cake as dessert. Of course, I will never say no. Well a lot things turned out to be complimentary but........ The starter bread was warm and crispy, also came out with another oilve oil infused with olives, anchovies. The hint of orange zest was quite a surprise for me. and of course, I finished it to the last piece and the drop.The service is excelllent as these guys are doing their best in their dream restaurant not just to our table, but to all other tables by the look of how they are tending them. Just imagine you are served by the owners. And we could tell how thought thru each courses are and that our responses are being observed. Love love love the presentations.. everything in this place is tastefully done and screams style. I saw next table having homemade gnocchi, which will be my next meal at Tabaré. The ambience in this place is really mellow. Good to just chill and enjoy the food. Everyone here seems kind of somewhat South Americans since I didn't hear much English around except our table. Of course, the owners speak English. Did I tell you that I am officially in love with Tabaré? which I've been already dancing around about to all my friends. My friend who took me there first said, it's to support friends but no need. Tabaré is perfect as it is. It is what we say what you see is what you get. And I somehow don't mind sharing this love with everyone. P.S. They are still in the process of getting a liquor license, so you can BYOB. That's what we did. One more thing, how come no one yelped Tabaré yet?",30,0.9995

At first, I didn't understand the whole concept of a Canadian Jewish deli, but darn was everything we had tasty! Started off with a bottle of the Brut and the chopped liver and pletzel. Initially, I didn't know what pletzel was, but with liver, you figure it must be some sort of bread. It was a thick piece of bread, like a cracker, pita, pretzel combo, that was covered with sea salt. The chopped liver (I know, I'm sure it sounds gross to most people) was some of the best that I've ever had! So flavorful and the consistency was solid...I was tempted to get a to go order to take home. Between the 3 of us, we had a Mish-Mash, which was a lox scramble with onions and greens. Probably my least favorite, it was just a bit too salty. I actually tried to order the smoked meat hash, which was brisket, potatoes, onion, and fried egg, but they were sold out. Boo. The smoked meat sandwich was beef brisket on rye with mustard. The 1/2 lb of brisket (I know, TONS) was soooo tender and flavorful with plenty to share!

My sister recommended this place as well.The fillings are really fresh, you can tell because the cilantro was nice and crisp and not limp and soggy. I've never tried the number #1 with the pork pate. Not being a huge fan of pate, I wasn't eager to try it on a sandwich, but my sister insisted. Normally I stick to the grilled pork banh mi's because I prefer the sweeter marinade flavor. The #1 didn't disappoint. It's my favorite Banh mi so far! I can't wait to come back. The egg rolls per Wing L's suggestion were really good too!

1583,20,9,5.0,"There's Canada and then there's Quebec. Quebec is an entirely different kettle of fish from anglophone Canada, far more European feel and outlook on life. When I squeezed myself in through the foyer of the 50s style metallic diner, I heard the melodic sound of French being barked to the waiters, saw the carefully executed dishes finished off on the counter, and everyone working fast, furiously, but with a smile and elan, I knew I would be in good hands.M. Wells (M is for magasin, French for store) is a diner, but, oh, what a diner it is. Hugue Dufour of the Au Pied de Cochon fame in Montreal and his wife, Sarah Obraitis, carefully renovated this place to retain all of the characteristic diner vibe of an open kitchen, a long bar where you see the cooks slinging hash, and some booths. They did put in a long table at one end of the diner so they can accommodate parties larger than 4. I arrived during Sunday brunch prime time (patrons were crammed in any free space there was available in the diner), but the hostess quickly squeezed me in at the bar. BTW, a coat rack is available in the vestibule off to the right end of the diner when you walk in.I ordered the egg-sausage breakfast sandwich and coffee. I didn't have much expectation for the coffee, but I was so wrong. It was rich and strong and didn't turn into a sandy color the moment I put in a single drop of milk. Ah! Just how I wanted to start my Sunday morning, er, afternoon. I thought I made great egg English muffin sandwiches, but M. Wells' is out of this world EPIC. First of the all, the breakfast sausage is like no other sausage that I've ever had before. I'm pretty sure they must make it. Pure porky goodness with a velvety smooth texture (in between the texture of pork sausage and foie gras). The sausage has a lovely sage overtone. Perfectly cooked silky smooth scrambled eggs that were draped over the breakfast sausage like a curtain. The pickled jalapeno gave a spicy kick to the sandwich. A slice of tomato and melted cheddar cheese inside the largest English muffin that I've ever seen. This was a huge breakfast sandwich. I LOVED it.The only quibbles that I have was that 1) the menu didn't list mayonnaise as being in the sandwich, which is a problem for me because I can't eat mayonnaise without getting really sick afterward, so M. Wells, please kindly fix your menu, 2) the texture of the English muffin was entirely too soft. I would have preferred a crisper muffin so that way the sandwich had a crunchy aspect to it because otherwise everything was the same soft texture. We need variety in our sandwich, not only with ingredients, but with texture too, and 3) Not sure if the cheddar cheese added anything to the sandwich because I couldn't taste it.Still this was absolutely amazing. The sandwich was so big that I couldn't finish all of it. Even though I only had three or four bites left, it was sooooo good that I couldn't bear the idea of leaving it behind so the waiter kindly wrapped it up for me. Yes, it was *that* good. A portion so small that I would have normally told them to discard it, instead I squirreled it away to enjoy and savor at a later time.M. Wells has all sorts of delicious things waiting for you to try. For the culinary adventurous, M. Wells has such delicacies, such as pickled pork tongue sandwich, crispy chicken skins, and blood sausage hash. If these things don't appeal to you, don't worry, they have more standard Quebecoise fare, like tourtiere (meat pie) and the thickest, juiciest pork chops to tempt you with.Although Traif and M. Wells are two entirely different styles, both restaurants celebrate the glory that is the pig. Brooklyn may have Traif, but *we* have M. Wells.",24,0.9993
1584,28,18,5.0,"Your favorite noodle place is probably some hole in the wall on a bustling Chinatown street. No frills, kind of dingy, fluorescent lighting. The kind of place that doesn't invite lingering after your meal. You let those things pass to sample a nice bowl of noodle soup for a mere few bucks. Well, Hung Ry is not your favorite noodle place - at least not yet.Nestled on Bond St. where expensive, trendy food for good looking people make themselves home, lies Hung Ry - A modern yet humble establishment that is just a few months old. Whether you choose to sit on the church pews that line the wall or up at the bar to watch the chef thwack those noodles, the owner and staff are quick to welcome you and proudly recommend some dishes.Appetizers are under $10 and immediately show off the chef's creative executions and skills without sacrificing taste. The squid appetizer was unexpected - an evolved 'salt pepper squid' of some sort, complete with crispy squid rings and tentacles, toasted pumpkin seeds and a killer guajillo chili paste you'll want to mop up with the last bits of squid. The short rib with daikon and shiso was also really good although the foam looked to be an aesthetic addition they could do without. The flour used for the noodles is organic while the other ingredients are locally sourced, if that's what matters to you. Needless to say, the noodle soups (from $12 up to $20 for their lobster offering) are insanely delicious, introducing updated flavors into the much loved Asian comfort food. The broth in my smoked pork belly noodle soup was rich without being too oily or heavy. The broth had enough depth to compliment rather than compete with the smokiness from the silky pork belly and tongue, roasted radishes and brussel sprouts. My dining companion's bowl of noodle soup with duck breast/leg, Szechuan and roasted peppers was another treat. Generous tender pieces of duck swim in a rich broth with hints of spices that enhances the dish rather than overwhelm it. The noodles, whether you like them thick or thin, are cooked perfectly - a worthy vehicle to help slurp up that broth.The owner was walking about throughout our stay, checking in on us, overseeing the dining room, and taking drink orders. We graced him with positive feedback that brought a warm smile to his face. A confirmation to him that we will soon be returning to eat our way through the menu.In a city where ramen is king in the higher end of the noodle spectrum and hole-in-the-wall cheap noodle places reign supreme, Hung Ry successfully stakes it claim in the market. Higher priced Asian food is something I don't eagerly venture out to try and can be hard to swallow when cheap, delicious options can be had all over the city. However food of this quality and caliber are well deserving of the slightly higher premium especially since their bold, fresh offerings pay homage to an Asian staple while introducing something new for everyone to enjoy.[Dedicated to Mohammad R. for the heads up on Hung Ry and his drool worthy photos.]",27,0.9976

He turned to greet me -I saw that he'd assumed the snappy form of Chun L. in business formal- as beautiful women floated by to take my coat, pour me water, smile.

The oysters (blanched, and served with seared foie gras and a dollop of uni) was the culinary carnation of an orgasm. Food tastes like orgasms here! The rest was tasty and beautiful, if not nearly so special. Following dinner, I ordered several delicious, calpico-sweetened, yuzu-infused cocktails at the bar downstairs - which was clean and gleaming - heaven's afterparty.

That first bite of the Maine Style Lobster sandwich, made me feel in my bones, that I was somewhere on the tip of the oceans in Rockland, enjoying the best catch of the day. Granted these were Maine lobsters, I was still transfixed. The white bread is slightly toasted with some charring on the outside, but soft like marshmellow when you bite into it. Along with that soft texture of the bread is the buttery and cool snap of the steamed lobster flesh, tenderly dressed in mayo and other magical seasonings happening in these vats at RHLP. Paired with a crisp pickle, a bag of cape cod chips and a bottle of lemon lime soda, this was by far the highlight of my Red Hook Food Tour.The CT-style roll is served warm with butter and no mayo. I tried a bite of it, but quickly realized that a cold lobster sandwich befits my palate a bit more. Another popular item here is their whoopie pie. This chocolately-goodness was the main draw for a couple friend of mine who decided to pass on the lobster, but shared (and dominated) a whoopie pie. I didn't try any as I was way too stuffed (and needed room for the ""swingle"" experience that was to occur shortly after), but it sure looked pretty (damn) good.The lobster roll will set you back about $18 with the drink, but look at all the money you'd be saving if you nixed that lobster trip to Maine and just stick to good ol' BK.

Based on that assumption, I will say with absolute confidence that La Superior is without question an appropriately named restaurant.The food is so good!! Seriously, it is so good.

Those ribs were pungent with the animal's rustic musk and covered in a redolent, sweet, spicy and sticky sauce. My beau's eyes looked like two round unripened blueberries so pregnant with morning dew that they were about to fall off their grounding thin branches. Touched, I took a bite and was instantly put into a carnal coma. I couldn't move any body parts or feel anything besides the sensations in my mouth. The lamb was so tender it made my teeth feel stronger, fuck fluoride, LAMB RIBS. Mmmmmm, oh my, my mouth is watering Jabba-the-Hut style reliving that moment. Another dish we got, that was amazing, was the Beet Cured Salmon with Rye Bread and Horseradish. The beautiful deep beet color laced the edges of the salmon like wax on a bottle of Maker's Mark. The salmon was so fresh that the lean and fat of the fish tasted mutually exclusive and produced a creamy flavor when chewed slowly. It was buttery and earthy from its beet treatment. The horseradish was zesty and brought out the richness of the salmon.Another incredibly intense dish we ordered was the pork belly. The coddled egg on top was a beautiful, shiny, ivory satchel and the yolk was custardy and a bright canary yellow. Gingerly, I kabobed a piece of egg with a chunk of pork and then speared into a leaf of purple radicchio. The pork was slightly sweet and juicy like a sunsoaked grape, the corners had a light caramelized crunch that was really pleasing. The radicchio was not dressed and its bitter flavor complimented the pork and egg's unctuousness perfectly. That's right, the dish was perfect.The next night, I ate there again. My girlfriend, a pastry chef at Gordon Ramsey, was also floored by all of their dishes.We got Hamhock Tots--- they were gooey balls of salty animal, cheesey crispiness. A really crowd-safe little dish. The Lamb Crepenettes were up next and it they were little oblong spheres of lamb sausage. They were flavorful and salty, but nothing compared to the LAMB RIBS. The rose we ordered went super well with this dish, I think I drank a whole glass with it...Lastly, but not least, we got the pumpkin ice cream sandwich. That ice cream was pudding-strength, I mean, it did not melt into a liquid. Mmmmm, it was spicy. The ginger-snap cookies resting a-top broke in a crumbly, layered way that shortbread cookies would and were purposefully less sweet.I crown thee, 6th Street Kitchen (pretentiously just called KITCHEN on your awning), the best damn restaurant in Alphabet City.",29,0.9852

1593,31,25,5.0,"They have a huge selection of food here for a place that is meant for having your eyes checked. yelp.com/biz_photos/cTeA… Walking in to confirm my appointment, I was asked do I want anything to drink and were given the option of coffee, hot tea, cold tea, water, soda, and beer. Beer....Did they just say beer? Imagine that. See if your optometrist would give that to you. No? Well, then you are patronizing the wrong place apparently. To help wash it down, they have a whole snack area towards the back. Feeling like being healthy today? Granola bars, fruits, and rice crackers are available. Hell with the healthy eating and want to just scarf anything down? Cookies, candies, fresh popcorn (with flavored seasonings and movie theater styled butter available to top it off) etc are there also for the taking. The popcorn is sooo goo..... Wait. What? It's supposed to be a review of an Optometrist's place, not a food review? Opps... sorry. Force of habit when it comes to Yelp and food for me.Let me restart.I usually rate the process of getting my eyes checked only slightly above having my teeth pulled. I normally grit my teeth, walk in, get bored to death while waiting for my turn at that torture machine that puffs air straight into your eyeball. All that just to walk away a few hours later with the happy news that my eye sight is getting ever slightly worse.At Park Slope Eye, they did what they could to make the experience as pleasant as they could for everyone. They provide a laptop with internet access in the waiting area to help pass the time if you are not interested in reading the usual magazines found at other places. There are toys to help distract the customer's children while they are waiting ( Since this is Park Slope we are talking about, I imagine these toys are being used a lot ). There is even a lot of foo.... You have heard enough about the food already? Ok.  Ok. Skipping it. I'm continuing the review... sheesh.The machines are much more modern than the places that I've previously checked my eyes at in the past like Pearl Vision and Cohen's Optical. That torture machine I talked about. The one that puffs air unpleasantly straight into your eyeball? They replaced that one here with something newer that is less invasive and only looks into your eye. That itself is almost worth having my eyes checked here instead. Boy do I hate that air puff machine ( I wish I knew what's it called. I sound so stupid calling it the air puffing machine but I'm currently too lazy to Google the proper name ). I even received a digital photo by mail of the inside of my pupils. I was told it was to see how healthy my blood vessels were, how my optic nerve was doing, and if there is a possible chance that something is amiss and could lead to some form of eye cancer. This is something new to me at these places.The whole process of having my eyes checked was fast and efficient. Although I use contacts most of the time, I could see through browsing the store that they have a good selection of glasses to choose from.The staff is incredibly friendly and patient. I saw them taking the time to explain in detail the co-pay options for a particular patient's benefits. Justin B, one of the eye doctors at the place ( and fellow Yelper to boot ) is very easy to talk to and acts more like your friend than your doctor. Friendly banter seems to be the norm with his patients here. In the end, this has been the best experience having my eyes checked anywhere and it's hard to imagine going back to any place else after this.P.S. As of this review, if you are a fellow Yelper, and I assume there is a good possibility that you are if you are reading this review, Park Slope Eye has an offer of a $25 gift card for new customers.",30,0.9935
1594,23,37,5.0,"I was with my out-of-towner friends at an AirBnB pad when the cylinder on the door lock malfunctioned around 11:30 p.m. We were locked out of the place with no word from the landlord. Luckily, I remembered Jane K.'s 5-star review of Lockbusters that I'd bookmarked on Yelp. [Thanks, Jane!] One frantic phone call to Lockbusters and Jay arrived with superhero speed: within 20 minutes. Jay was able to open the lock immediately, take apart the pieces, and explain to us what the problem was. (Something about how the lock components weren't laying flat like a sandwich and it's like when the beef patty falls out of a hamburger. I don't really understand what that means but that's why people don't call me in the middle of the night to bust open their locks.)Not only did Jay fix the lock, he's this cool, young guy who was not creepy and really cute--so cute that none of us minded one bit that a stranger had crashed our late-night house party and was making loud mechanical noises in the entranceway. One friend kept marveling at his muscular arms and even my lesbian friend was still swooning over him into the next day.I highly recommend Jay to solve your lock problems, or if you just want to get a sweet-looking hottie to your place late at night to do some drilling.",25,0.9712
1595,39,30,5.0,"Rincon Criollo reminds me of the character Mustafa in the Austin Powers movies, who survives repeated attempts to eliminate him by Dr. Evil, the most memorable scene being: youtube.com/watch?v=htRH…The story goes that the Acosta brothers were forced out of their beautiful beachside restaurant in Havana by gun-wielding soldiers. Fleeing to the U.S. they survived through odd jobs till one day they ran into an old friend from Cuba, who helped them re-open their restaurant in Queens.I looked at the plaque on the wall honoring their 25 years in business. As I commented on their silver jubilee, my Puerto Rican friend excitedly corrected me that the award itself was given in 1985 and so they should be celebrating their golden jubilee soon. One look at the dignified demeanor of one of the brothers, whom we recognized from the picture on the wall, inspired me to read as much as I could to learn about his story.I am from Miami, so I know good Cuban food..... Well, not really - but you don't need to go to Miami to enjoy great Cuban food. Rincon Criollo would stand up to the very best in the cuisine. I have no credentials to say this, other than repeated consumption at restaurants like Havana Alma, Café Habana, Sophie's, Tina's, Victor, etc. - all notable in their own right, but pedestrian in comparison to Rincon Criollo.You may think that you've had great Ropa Vieja. Well, Rincon Criollo will make you think again. My Puerto Rican friend who always gets Ropa Vieja any time we eat Cuban, swore that this was the best she'd had. I do not have as much experience, but the meat cooked like shredded rags has a tenderness of texture and boldness of tomato flavor that would make one weep with joy at the perfection of its execution.The pounded chicken breast, Chicken Rincon Criollo, cooked with onions and garlic is simple and tasty - as is the Chicharron de Pollo that would put any fried chicken to shame. The twice fried plantains, Tostones/Patacones are crisp and golden brown, though surprisingly not oily and the Cuban black beans are also the best I've ever had.I haven't been able to try their much touted milkshakes, but I really really love the coconut caramel flan! Another best in class - perhaps the densest flan I've ever had, and lip smacking good. By habit I ordered the Dulce De Leche on my next visit, but the ""Curdle Milk Dessert"" was different from any I've ever experienced or indeed expected. Much too rich, even for a sweet tooth like me, still something completely unique that merits at least a try. I would stick with the flan for my next visit, though.Castro may have wished to shoot this story's climax fifty years back, but all he succeeded in doing was giving NYC's Cuban cuisine a shot in the arm. You may go to Rincon Criollo to witness yet another affirmation of the triumph of human spirit over obstacles, or you may go to try food at its very best - simple and tasty. As an InFidel who believes that every one must get his just desserts - I go for all three reasons: Ropa Vieja, Cuban black beans, and coconut flan.",39,0.9991
1596,32,15,5.0,"The right components, the right texture, the surprising factor and the exotic side that belongs to a underrepresented cuisine as Moroccan is, evoked so much pleasure with each bite that I will remember the word Zaalouk for long time. Zaalouk are roasted eggplant slices with olive oil and garlic, tomato, arugula and balsamic vinegar. Hot in texture as is tender to the melting point, but served cold. A touch of sweetness. A touch of exoticism. I also loved their Briouats. This small pockets are made with pastry dough in a triangular shape and filled with pieces of chicken, tender and tasty, that preserves the meat flavor but that have incorporate the sweetness and spiciness of the rest of elements including ginger, cinnamon, saffron and almonds and maybe others. Sweet at first bite, tasty with the following. The dough was soft without missing firmness, and flavorful by itself. And not because the powder sugar that lightly covers each piece but because the way is made..well, I think they really use the special Moroccan pastry dough for this dish call warga* because I couldn't identify it as phyllo, which seems to be the alternative option.I didn't know that there was a previous location for Babouche at SoHo** closed now, and that Frank Bruni didn't like it at all. If the ""Second Chances""*** that he was asking for Babouche have allowed to reach this level at the current Brooklyn location, then I'll have to thank him not only for the enjoyment of reading his reviews. With the same name, same owner and same concept and references I'm assuming we are talking about the same place, maybe you know this and you can tell me for sure. But regardless, and besides what the original restaurant Barbès, the Manhattan brother is offering, I think Babouche represents authentic flavors using high quality ingredients, wrapped in a clean and exotic look but dressed in elegance. Add an excellent service, large food and drink menus, reasonable prices and seems clear that they known the formula for a five stars.We order many dishes as we were a large group and everything was just delicious. But the Moules a la Marocaine or Moroccan style Mussels, deserve to be mentioned. Served hot, inside the earthenware were seems to be cook, just in the last minute with the steam. The sauce, a mixture of tomato, crushed pepper, garlic and cilantro was light in texture but full of flavor and a bit spicy. If you taste Moroccan food you know you have to try couscous and tagine at some point. We had the Couscous aux legumes (vegetables), Couscous Marocaine traditional with lamb and Tagine de legumes. Served in their corresponding earthenware as well. The presentation is beautiful. The taste was excellent and the texture perfect: fluffy couscous, tender but firm at the same time and colorful vegetables, sign of the perfect steamed cooking, tasty and not watery at all. The flavors remind me what I had at Tunisia a few years ago although the two countries make different versions for both dishes. I think the couscous should be more tasty, even spicier by itself but mixing it up with the vegetables you really don't miss flavor at all. Shiraz and Malbec were the wines that we choose among a large list of different countries. Both were excellent, and I highly recommend it, but the classic pinots, cabernet or chardonnays are offered as well. Beer and champagnes are also an option. Pita bread was continuously coming warm to our table. A party of 15, complete only 2h after the dinner started. Yes, my party for 15 wasn't ideal, ok it was terrible as only half was there 1h after our reservation time when we start ordering. But complains? any. Rush? any. Bad faces or attitude? Any. The experience was complete after the 10min show of a belly dancer that interact with the patrons and can even choose your girls to dance with her when they are part of a group. This seems to happen every Saturday. The cost ... $40/person in total. ""Every city in Morocco has a special pull: Casablanca is known for its hospitality and warmth, Tangier for its cuisine and culture, Marrakesh for entertainment, and Fez is linked to the past and to its French roots""This is what Barbouche claim in their site to represent.

Since this is a corner shop, there's plenty of sunlight coming in through the glass from all over making this place even brighter. Any brighter I would need to wear sunglasses, but I like bright, so no complaints. I ordered an order of buffalo wings, a California Dream smoothie, the Peggy's burger deluxe, which comes with either fries, onion rings or curly fries. I ordered the pizza burger for my sister. Plus there are free burger toppings that includes: (inhales) lettuce, tomatoes, relish, onion, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, pickles, jalapeno peppers, green peppers, mayo, ketchup, mustard, A-1 suace, BBQ sauce and hot sauce (exhales). The food took 20 minutes to make, which was kind of long for just burgers and onion rings/curly fries.The buffalo wings were pretty good. The meat melts right off the bones. It was more sour than it was spicy, but it was still pretty good. Peggy's Burger was really really really good! The burger was very moist, topped with bacon, cheese and chili. On the menu it states that their burgers were never frozen, so I guess that's why the burger was so moist. The onion rings were really good too! The pizza burger has mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce, which was good. I still feel Peggy's Burger was way better. The curly fries were a bit on the soggy end. Overall the food here is yummy!

I've had the balls.  Arriving at 5:45 this place was PACKED. I put my name down for two and stepped outside. By the time Jade arrived they were ready to seat us in minutes. There's usually a wait, and they originally told us it would be 30. We were seated in less than 5. Awesome.This was my first time at The Meatball Shop and I found the way the menu works interesting. Laminated, you take one of their nifty makers (check the pics) and mark what you want front and back. Be sure not to miss the desserts! Luscious ice cream paired with chocolate chip, brownie, gingersnap, peanut butter or macaroon cookies. Mmm Yum! - don't forget to check the specials menu.

Our waitress approached us after a few minutes and since Jade had already been there, we were ready to order pretty fast (especially me being a rookie). I opted for sliders and a side of mashed potatoes. Jade opted for the Balls Al A Carte. After about 45 minutes of waiting and making idle chit chat with our Italian neighbors, our waitress apologetically told us our food would be out shortly. Embarrassed by the amount of time it took to serve us, a very attractive server/ maybe restaurant manager came over to us to apologize for taking so long and put dessert on the house and offered us drinks gratis. We passed on the sangria since Jade doesn't drink and I don't really either (except for a nice wine or some shots) and opted for their Summer Berry Lemonade. Yum! Jade and I were both very impressed. We hadn't even complained that our food was taking so long. Out loud anyway. Each meatball slider was quite delicious but my favorite was the spicy pork. Don't let the word spicy deter you. It's more of a pleasant kick that makes you go ""Ooo!"" The mashed potatoes were heavenly. Coming from me, that's an uber compliment considering my Aunt makes the best mashed potatoes on earth. Southern style recipe passed down from my Uncle's relatives who were slaves. These were comparably delicious. Creamy/buttery, topped with chives, small pieces of scalloped potatoes I practically licked my plate clean.Next up, our free dessert. Delicious homemade ice cream packed between two delectable cookies I opted for vanilla with chocolate chip and Jade for strawberry with ginger snap. Both were drool worthy and we finished them up loving every bite.Now, since I had been really excited to go to this place, my boyfriend wanted me to bring him a treat to try. Meatball sammie he asked for so when our dessert came our waitress put in my order for a meatball smash with provolone for my man. This time our order was ready quickly and she neatly placed the bag on the back of my chair to take when we left. An FYI, if you want to do takeout too, they don't do sliders. Everything else is fair game. Now for my signature part of the review, the bathroom. Hidden behind a thick dark wooden door with just a simple rooster plate on the front, the bathroom is actually really nice.

It was all wrapped up neatly and quickly, and my total was less than $14. That would buy me 3 items at Food Emporium. And they take cash as well as credit card here.As soon as I got home I dug into the mozzarella and prosciutto and man was it good. So fresh I swear it's calorie free. The next day I cooked up the sausage. The sausage!!! The sausage... spicy and so plump, like it's bursting from its casings. I was home all alone and stuck a fork into one and ate it like a lollipop. I started with getting the basics from Esposito's but I hope to progress onto braver things. One of my favorite dishes is fried chicken gizzards and I'm determined to cook them myself one day. I had a long stare down with the gizzards when I was in the shop, trying to build up the courage to buy them (I actually have to touch those things...?) and I lost. But one day I'm taking those gizzards to school.Esposito's is quintessential Noo Yawk. It's the butcher shop we go to on stop #2 of grocery shopping day, after stop #1 - fresh produce, and before stop #3 - baked goods. Nothing makes me feel more like a true New Yorker than being able to say, 'I godda butcha guy.'",20,0.9957

My clever compadre: You got stung!On a cold chilly night, I darted down a side street and quietly entered this dark, unassuming, beautiful, cozy bar. Exposed brick, gold wallpaper, antiques and a small jukebox add just the right touch of intimacy and secrecy.I started off with a Hornet ($8) which is made with tequila, campari, grapefruit juice, splash of grenadine. Although strong (the way I like it), I I would have preferred this with gin. After this, I swtiched to beer. A safer bet as I didn't want to get sloppy. Everyone at the bar was super-friendly, chatty and acting in concordance with the Brooklyn Bill of Rights.***I will definitely be back to enjoy some brews and friendly company. FYI: They are currently NOT serving food. No empanadas here. That was disappointing (they were getting their empanadas from Bogota). They are waiting for a health inspection, and then perhaps will serve food again. But, they have a myriad of menus to order take-out. Note: Mon and Tues $2 off drinks. Wed-Sun $1 off drinks.

1609,20,18,5.0,"This has been, and still is, my favorite place in K-town. If I had a choice, I'd probably not go anywhere else. I don't like the throngs of Korean yuppies in 3rd floor with the pseudo models hanging (or pretending to hang) on their every word, or the mixed crowd of yuppies in Players who think they're being cultured by being in a Korean ""sports"" bar. Don't get me wrong, Baden isn't without its flaws. The random signage hanging on the walls is reminiscent of an Applebees but to throw this feeling off, they dress their waitstaff in black dress clothes and black vests-- like they're catering at a gothic wedding. Regardless, it's unpretentious and most days you can actually hear what the people you're with have to say. Their nakji bokkeum (octopus stir-fry) is what I come back for every so often. It's delicious and spicy (not for those who have low spiciness threshold) and chewy and filled with noodles. I will warn you that the kind of noodles you will get aren't consistent-- sometimes they're udon and sometimes its the angel hair noodles. If you have a preference, ask for it. Nonetheless, when it's drenched in the red sauce, it's all delicious!I would like to take a little more time to address some of the previous chicken comments. This place does not serve Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) nor does it claim to. It claims to serve ""tong dak"" which means whole chicken. I think they just meant rotisserie chicken. And before Bonchon came and started frying the critters, this was the golden standard of Korean chicken. Random nostalgic moment: before I had to worry about weight gain, my girlfriend and I used to come to drink a pitcher of beer (each) and eat a whole chicken and nakji bokkeum.

If you're looking for an intimate, romantic location, don't come to Radiance. Otherwise, Radiance should more or less end up being a wonderful experience. After a lovely show at City Center, the bf and I crossed the street and were surprised to find a teahouse that was still open past 10pm. Not really in the mood for alcohol, we decided to stop in for some tea. The place is one-half book store, one-half tables. It really does feel like a bookshop cafe, except instead of cramming in as many tables as possible, they make it a priority to not crowd anyone. The place is maybe just a little too brightly-lit -- they aren't really shooting for any ambiance, but just a very casual, welcome, friendly setting. Not exactly romantic, but still a good place for couples and groups alike.Waitstaff is so friendly. When we came, there were only two waiters. It should have been enough for such a small space but they seemed overworked. Everyone's food came out slow, which can be frustrating, so don't come if you are in a rush. We ordered two pots of tea and their selection of Chinese teas is excellent. We were offered a rebrew but declined. Presentation is very cute. Our waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, if arguably a little too energetic. It almost made me tired talking to him, but ultimately he helped make the experience memorable. You don't often meet someone as friendly or genuine as him, and he greets you with a smile and warmth that begins as soon as you step in. It helps that he's also super passionate about tea and everything on the menu.The food was delicious. Mochi is very small, but so fresh and soft! The mochi ice cream is nothing special but I absolutely loved the dumplings, particularly the woodear mushrooms which are served with a delicious house made sauce. The cost quickly adds up when you taste a variety of teas and small plates here, but we were not disappointed. Quality ingredients and very delicate flavors made me a fan. If you're not in the mood for a pot of hot tea, don't be afraid to venture to their iced teas. Their sweetened moroccan mint is one of my summer staples and totally worth it (it helps that it comes with a bendy straw too).Will definitely return, even if it can be pricey.

1611,14,9,5.0,"Getting a meal as a gift is about the food and the experience. I had heard a lot about Momofuku and just about all of it is true. It is a small space that remains crowded. The size of the restaurant is underlined by small tables flanked by chairs without backs. $16 may be more than you're hoping to spend on noodle soup. It all sounds so negative, and you'd think I'd only give it four stars because of that, but for the food... The pork buns are amazing with pork butt folded into some of the softest dough ever with spicy and crunchy cucumbers. The noodles in your ramen will kick your Maruchan, 99cent, salt-in-a-packet lunch out the window. But then there's the chicken. I've eaten what's considered some of the best fried chicken in the country, Gus's of Memphis, and was wary of the fried chicken here. I went with an open mind and mouth and was so pleasantly surprised. When you order the chicken dinner you get two chickens fried two different ways, Korean and Southern buttermilk; the latter being the favorite of our table. I can't and won't compare or will at least try not to as there is room for both, especially since they're in different states. The chicken was so moist, so flavorful, so hot, so... so YES! It is accompanied with pancakes, should you want to eat it moo shu style, and a variety of sauces (skip the hoisin and sriacha and go straight to the jalapeno & garlic or chives and whatever that was). Frankly, I thought all of that got in the way so I didn't even bother. I did contemplate going around the corner to the Milk Bar to try the soft serve since they have more flavors there but finishing a Christmas present with candy cane/mocha ice cream covered in chocolate chip cookie crumbs seemed like the best idea.My advice would be to bring a bunch of friends who also love good fried chicken and chow down. If you do it right you can finish the whole plate. There were five of us and with pork buns, ramen, and potatoes, there were only four pieces of chicken left.",11,0.9964

Meet us at White Star on 21 Essex St."" The four friends shiver-jaunted down two barren blocks, wondering whether the White Star would indeed guide them to a happier place. White Star was dark, scene-y and intimate. We were four of twelve patrons scattered around the dimly lit bar, with a few more cosying up in the wooden booths along the old brick wall. We warmed up in an alcove by the entrance, and then the night began.For the next four and a half hours patrons came and went, but we stayed. From ""Dark and Stormys"" to ""Beez Neez"" to stawberry and bourbon concoctions to anything with tequila to anything with gin to trappist beers, the liquor went down as the conversation did - smooth and effortless. Among a myriad of subjects, we talked about a weird acquaintance we suspect could be god, pan's labyrinth, business school mania, sharks, and the realistic chance that there could be a fight club operating in a Chinatown basement. Time just flew by as if we were sitting in a living room on a lazy sunday afternoon. That's when I knew that White Star was the beez neez. We ended up having a thirty minute conversation with the bartender/mixologist Kelvin and the manager, both of whom are New York natives. Should've known. No outsider can make you feel so much at home in the city. Turns out, Kelvin also works at Milk 'n' Honey on Monday/Tuesday nights.

I mean I love jerk chicken as much as the next guy but what's a brotha gotta do to get some smothered pork chops ?In the past it meant crashing predominately black churches luncheons.Reverend: Brother James have you finally found the Lord ?Me: Is he here? I just found the turkey wings and greens. I'll keep an eye out.Strangely my humor wasn't appreciated.Thankfully Fosters makes excellent, reasonably priced soul food. The smothered pork chops I raved about when it was called Ruthie's is still fantastic. Other standouts are the fried whiting ( nicely seasoned and not overly breaded), the smothered turkey wings (not available everyday) and the sides. The mac & cheese deserves mention because it one of the best I've had outside of my family or black churches. I prefer a solid, cheesy baked mac & cheese as opposed to the more liquid-y kind and Fosters delivers.The sweet tea was also perfect, probably the best I've had outside of NOLA. I had the fried chicken once a while ago and thought it was just okay. It may have been an off day since it seems to be the most popular order the times I've eaten here. The portion sizes are huge considering dinners range from low to mid-teens. Lunch is always a good price to portion ratio and is less crowded.The dining space is clean and nicely decorated but small. I'd guess they can maybe seat 12-14 people max. Come solo or as a couple, a group would be hard at dinner (easier at lunch time).In addition to bringing southern food they bring southern hospitality too. From inquiring about regular customer's families to welcoming newcomers, to politely handling rude diners, the ladies here are wonderful. It's not perfect but the price, quality and friendliness makes Fosters one of my favorite places to eat.** Currently no credit cards and closed Sunday & Monday **...To clear any confusion, Fosters is the same restaurant as Ruthie's (yelp.com/biz/ruthies-res…).

1616,15,7,5.0,"I first went to Yasuda when visiting New York at the end of 2008, fresh from a trip to Japan it evoked memories of eating breakfast at Tsukiji, long wooden counters, consummate skill and incredible quality. For the next eighteen months I was lost in an Uni wonderland, the love affair that started that night, still consumes me this very day. Last night I made a long awaited return. As a first date venue it can be a little intimidating and I immediately wondered if I had made the right choice, but the warm reception from our counter chef and occasional but not imposing banter, soon allayed those fears. We decided against the Omakase, I have had it before but like the freedom and flow of the meal when ordering piece by piece. For me the jewel of the crown was undoubtedly the Uni, rather than have this straight away we had a few palate warmers, Monkfish liver and Japanese pickles. The liver was served as three slivers, in a Yuzu and Daikon dressing, it was creamy but my date loved it more than I, so we swapped and I devoured the pickles, my number one vice.Next was the Sushi, for which we regularly turned to our chef for advice, and ate in pairs:Yellow tail - Mild and sweetFatty tuna - Warm and deep in colourUni - Alaskan and Mayne - The Alaskan was beautiful, brighter in colour than the Mayne and incredibly sweet Oyster and Japanese Mackeral - The Oyster was creamy, soft and incredibly fresh, melting upon the tongue. The Mackeral was clean and sweet defying the oily nature of the Mackeral family Hamachi - Farmed and wild, one variety was known as the bully fish due to its size Sea Scallop - Delicious, lightly dusted with sea salt, my date had the cheek to tell the chef that she found it a little salty and could without the salt, he took it well Toro roll - The finest roll I have had the pleasure of eating, diced fatty tuna, surrounded by a rare high quality seaweed that is only available by auction, simply divine, a must haveThe size of each piece is perfect, according to the website, Yasuda assesses the size of one's mouth to ensure the size will be just right. The ratio of fish to rice is also delicately measured, the thin sliver of fish complimenting the small bundle of rice. What is immediately apparent is the quality of the rice, warm and fluffy, the balance of salt, sugar and vinegar in perfect harmony. I won't rehash what has been clearly articulated many times before but it is due to the types of rice, sea salt and brown vinegar that they use. The brown vinegar is naturally sweeter and softer in flavour than the white counterpart allowing them to use less sugar. I once watched a cooking show where the chef defined the perfect risotto as one where each grain of rice retained its sense of individuality, a little wanky but I loved that line and preceded to make it my own and the defining virtue by which I made risotto. Now I feel that in Yasuda it has a more worthy recipient and in my mind I play out scenes where Yasuda is a general, surveying a battlefield with millions of grains of rice, each with its own clear set of instructions, such is the mastery that they have over their rice. Believe the hype, make a reservation and let yourself go.Billing notes:At around $5 per piece it can add up but the sake is reasonably priced, expect to pay around $100 per head.Important notes:-Counter service bookings are for 90 minutes only, be sure to specify that you would like to sit at the counter when making the booking-If possible get a counter booking with Yasuda himself, or the funny and factual old guy right at the end-Counter bookings are only kept for 10 minutes so don't be late-The Shoyu(soy sauce) is a trap, use it without instruction and be shunned for the rest of the night, likewise the wasabi-Likewise the pickled ginger isn't a party snack, eat sparingly and only when you really need to cleanse your palate-When the sushi is placed on the wood board do not get lost in idle conversation and delay eating, the rice will go cold and harden and the chef will sigh and shake his head-Lastly for the feminists out there, do not ask why there are no women working behind the sushi counter, I wisely stayed out of that conversation",20,0.9989
1617,23,12,5.0,"Manny, the head masseuse at The Setai, has magic healing hands! This review for The Setai Spa is long overdue. I've visited several times and after much consideration, this is officially my favorite spa in NYC. It's a luxurious experience from start to finish. You exit the elevator on the third floor and are greeted by a peaceful, candle-lit hallway. To your left is the front desk. The friendly staff will then wisk you away to where there's a lavishly designed jacuzzi, steam room, and sauna as well as lockers, robes, and slippers; everything you would expect from your typical high-end spa experience. If there's time before and/or after your massage or treatment, you can enjoy the amenities. Alternatively, you can choose to wait for your therapist in The Setai Spa's tranquil tea room. They usually offer you some champagne and there are truffle chocolates, nuts, and cookies/crackers to snack on while you wait.I highly recommend requesting Manny, whom I mentioned above. Once in his capable hands, you will feel all of your pains and stresses melt away. I have lots of trouble with my back and neck as I used to be a professional wrestler, which I now compare to earning a living as a human crash test dummy. I ended up with a very bad injury which required me to have to get a two-level fusion neck surgery. My back and neck have felt a lot better since my operation but unfortunately, whenever I travel on long flights, it ends up aggravating my old injury. Recently, I've been going back and forth to visit my friends and family in California a lot and it's been taking a toll on me. As a result I was left with no other choice but to pay Manny another visit. It's expensive but it is worth it. He's my equivalent of visiting a doctor because he's the only one that can fix me up so that I can live to fight another day. While he's stretching and kneading the kinks out of me, I can feel and hear my joints slip back to where they are supposed to be. His technique is a less invasive approach to visiting a chiropractor. I wouldn't describe it to be anything like the jarring and cracking of an adjustment but more so like a gentle nudge to put everything in its rightful spot. I was advised not to see chiropractors after my injury but I've entrusted my spine to Manny and he's never done me any wrong. I cannot say enough nice things about him. Go pay him a visit when you have a chance, take a deep breath, relax, and enjoy.",29,0.3363

This 24-hour joint is obviously popular with the West African cab drivers in the city, and I would definitely rather see them sitting here having friendly conversations instead of avoiding them on the street while biking.They sat around large tables alternating their attention between the food, the rambunctious conversations, and the soccer channel on television. The owner would sit with them at times, giving the place a very friendly local feel. As newcomers we did not stand out at all though, even if my spotty French was not quite enough at times to describe what I wanted.At lunch, the restaurant has a rotating menu of three or more items, different on each day. The following two items were available on Mondays. The sauce arachide ($10) was very similar to other West African mafes, but had a more subtle approach to its peanut sauce, allowing other flavors to surface and creating a splendid soup for its beef. Served with a heaping plate of rice, the dish is definitely more than necessary for lunch.Another choice for the sides was a plate of yuca that appeared in couscous form. The owner recommended it with the second dish, the sauce Claire dindon ($10), and was spot on. It's a soup with turkey and tomato, but spiced with pepper and very oily. Both dishes brought back great West African memories with a small colorful pepper in the center.I also grabbed what appeared to be a homemade lemonade ($2), and expected it to be infused with something sickeningly sweet like vanilla.

He explains everything he does and frequently asks you if you have any questions. He takes digital xrays of areas that needs to be worked on to show it to you and puts it on file (that's a pretty smart move, I say). He even estimated how long the procedure might last.On my second appointment he worked on my tooth and made sure I was fine through out the entire process. Gosh, I really felt good psychologically on that chair*... as weird as it sounded. When we finished he showed me the work done and IT LOOKED SO NICE AND FELT SO NICE, compared to my previous dentist. Pardon my lack of proper dental terms but the filling was the correct color of my teeth (yes my previous dentist was that bad) and it looked so natural like nothing ever happened there.I have other areas to be worked on and I was worried with my insurance thus the Doc took xrays of it and told me that he'll send the proposal to the insurance company so they can mail me the estimated bill, in order for me to decide. That's thoughtful.The staff are nice. The receptionist is a darling.

Horny dogs will start humping fire hydrants and benches, which would be considered defacement of public property. Dogs would be arrested and sent to doggy jail.

1626,14,4,5.0,"I came here with my friends who recommended Mama Meena's for home cooked Filipino food. First off, it's a little out of the way, down Woodhaven Blvd. (off Jamaica Ave) but there was absolutely no lines! I hate waiting for good Filipino food.There's a few small tables, max is 6 at a table. Although they could make bigger tables for larger parties and there's simple paper white settings on each table. In the back is a flat screen with Filipino shows on. Our server was attentive and nice. Always keeping an eye on our beverages and refills. Our glasses were never empty. The Lumpia Shanghai was the best I've had. Fried to perfection and bigger than the ones I've had. My Sago drink wasn't overly sweet like I've had at iHawan. I actually finished the drink, also their version has jello in it. Yum-o!We ordered family style so we could share.Beef in tamarind soup - Sweet & sour, light soup with taro, okra, string beans, and eggplant in it. I really enjoyed this soup and would definitely get it again. I guess it's the Filipino version of Tom Yum.Lechon Kawali - Crispy and perfetly fried, if you like Chicharron, you'll like this. Don't forget to dip in the shrimp paste.Kare Kare - This is the best Kare Kare I've had. The peanut sauce actually had just enough PB in it and the oxtail pieces were huge! A bonus is the eggplant and green beans in it (I love eggplant!).Leche Flan - Delish! The best ending to a great meal.Halo Halo Special with Purple Yam Ice Cream - The purple yam ice cream was surprisingly good! I'm a fan of yam/potato ice cream.We had leftovers and I was happy to have it for lunch the next day. I'm recommending this place to my friends. It's great service, home cooked delicious food, and decent pricing. It's not too far away from me and there's plenty of parking in the area.",23,0.9983

I've been praising Hahm Ji Bach to my mother for a while, but my mom is suspicious of my taste in Korean food after not having lived in LA for so long. The best part of Hahm Ji Bach is the ban chan (side dishes). I could happily make a meal out of their side dishes and rice. With ban chan that goooooood, you don't need anything else. Read my previous review for what Hahm Ji Bach means. There was a huge spread of ban chan and while certain things like different kinds of kim chi and tofu will always be there, other side dishes always change. The marinated tofu in the chili soy sauce mixture is my favorite, along with the the Korean squash. My parents were mightily impressed with the quality and quantity of ban chan. My mom approvingly nodded her head and agreed that they really do serve great ones. She was absolutely ecstatic to see one of her favorites, which is a crab kim chi like thing. 1) All other restaurants that have this, have this as a special, not as a free ban chan, and 2) when they serve it, they give you just a small portion. She was amazed with how much of it they gave to us. Aside from a small taste that I had, she ate the whole thing herself. The ban chan is always really fresh and great. I've never had a single bad ban chan there. PLUS, as in the tradition of Korean restaurants, you can get as much ban chan as you want. The waitresses are really great about figuring out what you really like and they will often times slip you another before you have a chance to request it.We had our fill of ori (thinly sliced duck meat) and pork bulgogi. The waitress warned us that it would be spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all. I've had this dish three times and I have to say, this was the least spicy that I've ever had it. Usually it's spicier. My parent thoroughly approve of this place both in food and price. It's much cheaper here for better food compared to Manhattan. My parents complimented the waitress about the food. At the end of the meal, I asked my dad once more what he thought of this restaurant compared to LA.His answer was, ""It's just as good as LA.""Got it here, folks. Now go eat there!*They've been certified.P.S. Hahm Ji Bach loves Yelp. They had snippets of Yelpers' reviews in their menu and Wing's review was one of them! Great job!",30,0.9967

1630,18,7,5.0,"Soto is a Michelin starred sushi house just off of west 4th street. How I have never been here before or have heard about this place is beyond me! It's a nice find.I made a reservation for one, but that was ultimately unnecessary since there was only one other person at the entire sushi bar on my visit. I was seated in front of Sotohiro Kusugi himself -- nice. A third generation sushi chef, I found him to be affable, in control, and always professional.   The restaurant itself was the essence of Japanese minimalism, comically taken to the point of not even having a sign outside of the restaurant. You will likely need the street address to find the place as I have walked by it for years unaware. For dinner, I opted for the 12 piece nigiri omakase at an attractively priced $58. I was warned that it would take some time to prepare the sushi and was strongly encouraged to try some appetizers in the mean time. I found this strange, but I quickly relented. I additionally ordered the miso soup which, surprisingly, is not included in the sushi dinner. To drink, I went with the Koshihikari Echigo beer. The miso came in at a pricey $10 for a small bowl (all of the other menu selections were considerably more expensive and equally appetizer sized).  As far as miso goes though, this was considerably better than the usual offering. It was jazzed up by mixing in a lobster broth with the white miso and including chunks of lobster as well as chives and ginger shoots for flavoring. I appreciated the sophistication, but I was not overcome by the broth. The flavors did not meld as well as I would have liked. Also, the lobster was too sparse to justify the price point. Now for the sushi, the part that really matters. The selection was impressive with some uncommon choices in the mix. Definitely no salmon and hamachi here. This omakase was designed for the enthusiast. - The first selection was completely unfamiliar to me. It sounded like enamae. It had a characteristic green marking in its flesh and hailed from Japan. A nice beginning, the rice was quite good, soft, and served at the right temperature (a sign of a good sushi house). The fish was fresh and melted in my mouth. - Squid. Very nice. I was surprised by how tender it was. Another good selection.- Tasmanian ocean trout. A less common selection, but one I was pleased with. Great color. The flavor and texture were wonderful. - Aji (horse mackerel). Fine, if otherwise unremarkable.- Stripejack. This was brought out only moments after the placing of the horse mackerel. At this point, I noticed the tempo of the meal picking up, though I understood why these two sushi might be paired together. I did not have the presence of mind to ask if it was wild or farm raised. It was quite tasty, making me wonder if it was the wild version which is known to be rare. - Ama ebi (live sweet shrimp). Yes, raw shrimp, not that dreadful cooked shrimp that you will find at discount sushi houses. This was so amazingly good. The natural sweetness, the texture, it was all wonderful. I even said as much to the itamae, to which he politely smiled and nodded. - Saba bakno? (more mackerel). I wasn't sure what type of mackerel this was, but it was enjoyable. - Toro. No proper omakase can exclude toro. This example was deliciously fatty and fresh.- Maine sea scallop with sea salt and yuzu zest. A regional selection! Akin to the raw shrimp, this too was naturally sweet and delicious. Good scallops are like that -- never a miss.- Japanese sea bream with pickled wasabi inside. The wasabi was especially noticeable with its lovely piquancy. This was especially good. Another great selection.- Uni. Noticeably large and generous in portion size. This was clearly a high grade uni. It too had natural sweetness. Good uni can be so decadent.- Unagi (freshwater eel). This was fine, but I was surprised that this was the final course. Swapping the order with the uni would have been more memorable, for example.  A wonderful sushi experience. I did not find it to be the best sushi in the city, but it does easily place in my top five. The ease of getting a seat with the master sushi chef, and the rich diversity in the selection are distinctive points of note. The place is definitely on par with Ushiwakamaru if not a touch better.

1632,18,15,5.0,"You know when people say you'll know when you're in love because you will.... ""just know""? David Burke's Townhouse has brought me closer to this sensation. From your colorful displays of modern art, and the predominant use of my favorite color, red, to the cheerful, glass balloons lining the entrance to the main dining room, your style suits me well. The smile-inducing, fun décor, to your scrumptious food (a la crab and pretzel appetizer, to your cheesecake lollipops), have set my heart into motion. What a joyful playpen of a restaurant you are. I have fallen in love.Maybe this is a place to see and be seen, but I was too giddy over the experience to notice the Fonz sitting two tables across from us, or Donald Trump's right-hand man, George, but a table away from where we sat. I actually didn't even know who he was until Jimmy gave me a lesson in the Apprentice roster. How lucky we were that Restaurant Week was upon us this past summer. This dinner was one of the best I have ever had anywhere. The service is above average. Better than that, even. In a room full of diners, the waiters were attentive as if ours was the only table they were waiting on. They anticipated all our needs and were never once intrusive. Thanks to my butterfingers, I spilled a glass of water on the table, but before I could turn beet-red with embarrassment, one of the waiters materialized out of nowhere and cleaned up my spillage in a matter of seconds. They also wiped the crumbs off our table with that fancy device only sold at high-quality retail stores like Williams-Sonoma. If you've been to any shi-shi restaurant you know what I'm referring to; that little metallic scraper that never ceases to amuse people. Everything here is beautiful to look at, absolutely delicious, and fun to explore. American Cuisine can certainly be interesting and unique enough for the food enthusiasts out there, so don't shy away or flash a pretentious turn of the cheek on what it may be. David Burke is a genius man with happy intentions, which could very well be inverted as a happy man with genius intentions. Any way you look at it, Townhouse is spectacular and American Cuisine can proudly hold its own with a restaurant like this. 5 (very enthusiastic) stars for Townhouse.

Every year for Open House New York Weekend I try to go to Tom Otterness studio, and every year the tours sell out instantly.So, instead of Tom Otterness, this year for Open House New York Weekend 2010 I got to visit a poop plant.Newtown Creek is the largest of NYC's 14 wastewater treatment plants, with a capacity of a whopping 310 million gallons of poop water a day[1]. What attracted me to this sewage treatment plant is the look of it: if Frank Gehry were to design a sewage treatment plant, he would have created the Newtown Creek plant.Affectionately known as the Shit Tits by the locals, the plant has 8 gigantic steel ""digester eggs"". Each massive egg is clad with low reflectivity stainless steel, is 145 feet high and 80 feet in diameter, and holds 3 million gallons of sludge. Overall, they look like a gigantic space ship out of the movie Dune.During our visit[2], we had the opportunity to climb on top of the eggs, which are connected by a bridge. From the top of the egg there is a magnificent, unobstructed view of Brooklyn and the skyline of Manhattan.The plant is illuminated by a diaphanous blue light by night[3], creating a rather odd, if beautiful, effect that can be seen pretty well from the BQE. A sight that is sure to take your breath away... for many reasons.Which other sewage treatment plant has a sleek design, a visitor center, and a nature walk? This is most likely the coolest poop plant on Earth.------------------------------------------------------------[1] During the wastewater treatment process, organic material called sludge is removed from sewage. Much of the sludge is converted into water, carbon dioxide and methane gas. The remaining digested sludge is then dewatered to form a cake, which can be used as a fertilizer. The word 'cake"" will never have the same meaning for me...[2] The visitor center is open Friday and Saturday, 12 noon to 4 pm. Groups by appointment only. To book call 718-595 3509 or email educationoffice@dep.nyc.….[3] The lighting was designed by artist Hervé Descottes of L'Observatoire International, an American/French company.

1634,12,9,5.0,"I want to live here; that is all.OK, that's not all. But seriously? It is so nice here. Yesterday my mom, sis, and I squeezed in between an Italian family and a young couple on one of the Ace lobby's monstrous suede sectionals--for sure, a LOT of burgundy cows died for these sofas--and we just stayed and stayed. The large, high-ceilinged space is filled with antique furniture and lamps, and is lined with wood-paneled walls that feel as if they were plucked out of an Ivy League classroom. Having spent much time in Ivy League classrooms, I feel more than qualified to comment on such details.We started with a round from Stumptown, but when the last of our espressos had been sucked down, we were so not ready to leave. We thought about it thusly: outside- minus 5 wind chill, no booze (vs) inside- cozy suede sofa, yes booze. The answer was obvious, and we sent for the cocktail menu. The ONLY complaint I have about this whole operation is that the cocktail list is not superb. It offers only 5 or 6 drinks, none of which features whiskey--in my mind, a glaring omission. There should be a whiskey cocktail on every drinks menu in the city, particularly during the winter months. This doesn't mean, of course, that you can't get a whiskey drink here (I had a nicely made Manhattan), but still, I like to try a bar's original creations, and at Breslin Bar, that is not compatible with wanting to drink whiskey.The drinks that we did have, though, were very tasty (The Starling: St Germain + Lillet Blanc was light, subtly sweet, great for mom!), and I appreciated our server double-checking when I unknowingly asked for the priciest rye in my Manhattan. Or should I be insulted that I don't strike one as a high-roller? No matter. We snacked on their $5 caramel popcorn too, and when the fun-size bag arrived we at first scoffed, but when we ate we nodded in agreement...this is $5 popcorn.",16,0.9076

Against this backdrop, Bhojan has the best 'Indian street food and beyond' in New York.The pav bhaji is superlative. The buns are a distraction, but the vegetable mash couldn't have been better if it was flown in from Bombay. The chaats conjure up memories of bhelpuri stalls outside colleges in India. Bhojan also excels in bread--try the aloo gobi paratha, the methi thepla or the chole bature, to name a few kinds. The drinks and teas are authentic -- notably the fresh lemon pani and the chais. And to top it all, the prices are reasonable.On the flip side, Bhojan seems severely short-staffed. The servers, one of them a spitting image of Sourav Ganguly, the Indian cricketer, were friendly even if thinly spread and only occasionally seen, as they maneuvered their way around the closely-spaced tables and the token unruly diners in the main seating area in the back.In summary, Bhojan squarely fills the need for high quality Indian street food in New York.

1639,29,12,5.0,"Located on the 2nd floor toward the back of Flushing Mall, Joong Han Boon Sik (or ""Chinese-Korean Noodles Dumpling"") is proof of two things: 1) Some of the best food in Flushing is found in a mall and 2) It's not in the food court. With such good food, this is the kind of Asian fusion worth trying.Unlike most Asian fusion places, there is no pretension here, as it's a small food stall tucked away from the rest of the competition. Even the staff here is able to communicate in both languages. The owner tells me she's from the Dongbei (""Dongbaek"" in Korean) region of China, a northeast section of the country that is home to many ethnic Koreans.Dumplings are their main staple here, all made fresh and in several meat and vegetable varieties. Along with that are a nice selection of noodle dishes that complement the dumplings perfectly. Throw in a small side like their kimchi napa cabbage and the stage for a delicious meal is set.Though I enjoy all of their dumplings, the ones that personally stand out most are the steamed ""Four kinds dumpling"" (Mandarin: Si Zhong Jiao Zi / Korean: Nae Suhn Mool Mahn Doo), which are filled with sea cucumber, egg, pork, and shrimp.  The skin might seem doughy but is usually just thin enough to retain the juicy innards that make each bite delectable and savory. 18 of these dumplings can be had for between $6.50-8.50 depending on the filling and for another $7.50 a giant bowl of cold Korean noodles (Chinese: Zhong Han Leng Mian / Korean: Jong Han Myun) can be had to complete the effect. On a whole, the food is simple, fresh, reasonably priced, and above all, delicious.Dumpling lovers who are looking for a different alternative to the Northern Chinese dumplings, should venture to Flushing Mall, where the ""best dumpling"" debate has only become more heated.",35,0.9857
1640,11,14,5.0,"""Leave the gun, take the cannoli.""-ClemenzaBecause of Villabate, I have come to understand the pure cannoli zen of this statement. BEST. CANNOLI. EVER.The front window of the store has multiple shelves for display filled from end to end with pastries such that I felt I was about to walk into some sort of childhood sugar fantasy world on acid. Who could possibly be buying and eating all this? It's hard to imagine.The store looks clean and new, and the service is efficient. The biggest problem you'll have is choosing what to buy, because there are so many tempting things. In addition to traditional pastries, there are whacky creations that on this visit included seasonal items like a New Years cake with a confectionery clock, I gather for counting down to 2010. Ha! The place was just a hair short of Pee Wee's Playhouse, I swear.We were greeted by a life-sized singing Santa Claus standing next to the door as you walk in. If clowns scare you, this could be problematical. For me, it added to the Italian-style ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" atmosphere that pervades the establishment. It's quite a place.On to the cannoli:Normally, I like me some chocolate covered cannoli which are not available at Villabate, so when I stood in line with none other than Atif I. (aka best pizza crawl companion in the city), it was with no small amount of trepidation that I waited for our cannoli to be wrapped up for take-out. He'd billed this as the best one he'd ever had, and the man does his research. How could the best cannoli in the city not have a chocolate coating? It was hard to fathom.As we sat in the car after leaving, I watched with nervous anticipation as he opened the box to reveal what turned out to be two perfect confections, dusted with powdered sugar and adorned with a candied orange sliver on one end and a dried maraschino cherry on the other. One bite and I was convinced; this was the best cannoli on earth. The shell was crispy but didn't fall apart; it was sweet and flavorful and I didn't miss the chocolate coating I normally have one bit. In fact, it made me realize that chocolate coatings on cannoli are really just trying to make up for the mediocrity of the shells they cover. If the shell is quality, you don't need that chocolate. The ricotta inside was fresh, sweet and absolutely delicious, and nicely but not overly laden with chocolate chips. The entire experience was eye-opening. I will be back!Max D:It's clear you have some sort of grudge against Villabate, because what you said is so unbelievably off the mark, there's no other possibility. Not only do you insult an amazing pastry shop for what seems to be no reason and cite one inaccuracy after another, but you insult the entire neighborhood. Go back to freakin' Florida where you belong. The fact that you left NYC for that awful place (wait... you live in BOCA and you're somehow insulting Bensonhurst?!?) reveals volumes about what a complete and utter DOUCHE you are and why nothing you say or think is to be trusted by anyone.As they say in Brooklyn, ""Geh da faaaahhk outtaa heeeyyaahh!""kthxbye.",12,0.9758

Just as the waitress had informed, it is really spicy with a level of heat that is associated with authentic Thai style cooking. We had chosen pork for our Jungle Curry and it was served mixed in with green beans and bamboo shoots. The spice is infused in the dish. Even if you do not spoon extra curry sauce on your meat or get any peppers, you will taste the heat. It's delicious and it will stay with you for the next five minutes. If you have ever felt dulled by life, get this dish. It will wake you up and bring you to your senses. It is not recommended to eat this dish like a soup. I could only eat a little bit of the Jungle Curry but my friend was eating it by the spoon and forkfuls. I watched in amazement and laughed as beads of sweat fell down his face. Hats off to anyone who can stomach this dish.The other items** we ordered were just as wonderful. We tried the special appetizer Miang Khanal, which was recommended by a Thai friend. It is a medley of ingredients I suspect were shredded pork, lime w/rind, crushed peanuts, etc. It is served with the leaves of broccoli and you wrap it up like a burrito. It's crunchy, salty, sweet, and the burst of citrus flavor was perfect during this 92 degree heat. Miang Khanal is extremely refreshing. The Pad Kra Prao of crispy pork in basil sauce and Pad Kee Mao flat noodles with chicken were more of the typical Thai dishes and more spicy than mild and very good. I love that the food at Ploy Thai is spicy and not withered down for you and me. Overall, I enjoyed the food much more here than at Sripraphai. It's less Disneyland, less razzle dazzle, and there is definitely no smoke and mirrors. Ploy Thai is that hole in the wall restaurant with phenomenal food. It looks like a take out place and at first I scoffed that my friend had chosen a restaurant that wasn't even really a restaurant. The food speaks for itself and the flavors shine through despite the heat. Welcome to Thailand via Elmhurst.__________*I'll just assume this. If I am making an ass out of myself, so be it. **Skip the Steamed Thai Dumplings appetizer. It tastes like frozen shu mai.

1642,37,27,5.0,"I waited a week to write my 200th review looking for a material worthy of my 5 stars. And I think God finally heard me on a Sunday.I heard many things about Degustation but honestly I didn't think it would deserve 5 stars somehow. However, things happen always when you least expect it, nor looking. I was so fully satisfied at Degustaion this evening, to the point that I would want to sing Ode to Joy in soprano. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough gut space left to pull that off and also wanting to remain elegant in this sexy place where full of people who couldn't stop gushing about their own dishes to their next bar mates. We were seated comfortably at the middle of the bar and even could choose our own seats. Yes, Sunday is a good day to visit Degustation. The setting reminded me of Joel Robuchon's L'Atelier in Paris, my first experience of culinary art dinner about 6 years ago. But there, the kitchen stations are a little far or separated, no tables of course but bars resembling a sushi bar where you are served at. It was quite a sensation then and we saw people lined up for the daily opening time. Here, you see the kitchen, you can see them working and you can see them do everything closely. That being said, almost towards to the end of dinner, I feel the grill heat and felt hot a little. The service here is very pleasant and attentive. The chef Wesley Genovart and his chefs are cute and passionate about their work. We quite enjoyed watching the iron chef like (slow paced than that though) cooking process.  Wine selections are mostly from Spain. My Santiago Rioja Viura 2007 was born supremacy and ended up being one of my ever favorites. It has every notes that I love about, not too sour not too sweet with creamy(?) oak barrel and tobacco taste to it. We chose to have 5 course tasting menu ($50 per person) thinking 10 courses ($80) would be too much. It turned out that 5 course are more than you can handle and tiny but very rich. Degustation is a french term for tasting experience focusing on sensory system and THE Degustation is very true to that. And during the entire dinner, I felt like I have been one of the judges in the Iron Chef show and trying to discover each dish, and that really made our dinner more fun. Times that I most appreciate about dishes are when everything tastes like what it should be. In other words, everything tasted like the said ingredients and its best in Degustation. And no gimmick of million mixes of too complicated sauces or unidentifiable materials. The lamb loin (which I am not usually a fan of) tasted like a little tender lamb with rather pleasing lamb aroma. Four different kind of grilled heirloom cauliflowers uniquely tasted as four distinctive nuttiness, surrounded by the perfect pine nut puree and pickled raisins. Fresh snapper sashimi was brushed with sea salt based coat just enough, topped with fragrant micro Siso leaves. Sauces here are subtle but very complimenting and gracefully amazing like silky spreading pates. Grilling process for pork belly is intervallic in order to get the perfect crispiness. Eggs are pouched in the shells and poured onto the grill to be pan fried. Seasoning is minimal with controlled salting on the main ingredient but it is all compensated well by sauces or dressings. My dessert (not part of the course), caramelized Torja (torrijas) with strawberry was glorious. It is like french toast in Spanish version but more like doughy marshmallow like than soaked bread. So good. Chocolate pudding with banana cream and salty rice puffs was also very satisfying.The experience at Degustation is like happiness of my senses. It is not exciting and adventurous joy but, they recognize...what good and fine things are. Tastes so balanced and understandable that you feel content. Appreciation of when seeing someone understands you so well and making you smile. Or someone enlightened about what it is really about and has just told me. I don't know... I don't know what exactly but, I don't care if you understand it or not, because it was that great.I am going back for 10 courses. Very soon.",38,0.9996
1643,44,32,5.0,"On a gorgeous sunny day such as today, I like to bust open my piggy bank and hop on the D train out to Sunset Park. True, the area harbors an impressive array of taquerias where one can put their greenbacks to good use but it is also home to one of the better bánh mi shops in nyc. No lie. As with most fine sandwiches, it starts off with excellent bread. A light, crusty baguette is freshly toasted and sets the foundation for the nine inches or so of greatness that follow. Not too flaky, not too soft or dense, but goldilocks right. My usual order is their house special #1 or ""Bánh Mì Paté Tht Ngui, a delightful assortment of pork cold cuts. There's a healthy schmear of pate, some buttery mayo and various layers of pork. Inoffensive pork roll, Vietnamese ham, sliced roast pork, caramelized BBQ sausage and headcheese with cartilage bits. To balance this abundance of pork, there's a good handful of crunchy daikon and carrot which have been pickled long enough to reveal a sweet tang with the obligatory spear of cucumber. Fresh, generous sprigs cilantro round out the toppings. A dash of black pepper, a few squirts of maggi laced fish sauce, and you're good to go. If you like extra heat, ask for spicy and you'll get a few slivers of jalapeno and some sriracha to amp up this lovely sandwich.Your typical House #1 banh mi? Sure, maybe. Except that the bread is just right, the innards are tasty, aplenty and assembled in perfect fashion so that each bite is akin to a romp in a playground of flavors and textures. And this sandwich only sets you back $3.75** bones, a far cry from some of the other fancy pants concoctions about town. That's value for these thrifty times. You can choose to eat in, at one of the few tables in this plain, sparse snack house. But your best option on a pleasant day is to take your Viet hoagie to go. Walk the few blocks up to Sunset Park, plunk yourself down on a park bench and soak in the nice views of manhattan and its surroundings on the hill. Hey whaddya know? The zen like surroundings match perfectly with the ratios of flavors in your sandwich! As Raiden, the creepy thunder god from Mortal Kombat would intone:'FLAWLESS VICTORY!'**yea the banh mi's are cheaper in cdn and other american cities but this is pretty well priced for nyc",38,0.9985
1644,13,8,5.0,"Take it from somebody who has actually lived in Mexico: this place is about as authentic as it gets. I also have good authority to support my story because I ate with a friend who was born and raised in Mexico and she concurs that this is the first place we've been to in the United States that actually tastes like the food tastes in Mexico.After trying Taco Mix, it makes me wonder why there are so many Southern California transplants on yelp complaining about how there are no authentic Mexican restaurants in New York, but those people are complaining on places that it should be obvious that it wouldn't be authentic. I see these complaints in reviews for clearly Americanized burrito shops and vegan burrito places, which is clearly nothing like real Mexican. I even saw one guy from Orange County say. ""This grilled portabello mushroom burrito is the most authentic Mexican I've found in New York"" referring to Burrito Box's Vegan burritos. I don't even want to list the millions of things wrong with that statement. Anyone who comes here to Taco Mix and says it's not authentic is either A) Lying or B) Oblivious as to what authentic is. Now, I love the state of California and it's inhabitants but come on people, you can't complain about lack of authenticity if you're not even going to the right places! Also, ""authentic"" doesn't necessarily mean what you are used to eating as a child in Southern California. ""Authentic Mexican"" is from Mexico. In fact, I've been to Southern California many many many times in my life and always look forward to trying Mexican food there, but I got a news flash for everyone: I have never tried anything in Southern California that tastes as authentic as Taco Mix. When I walked in to this little dive in Spanish Harlem, I immediately knew that it was going to be authentic because I saw how they were preparing the al pastor. Now, most Mexican places that I've been to in America won't even have the slow-roasting spinning spit, and some of them who do, don't quite have the correct visual confirmation of something truly Mexican. This meat was huge and thick. When I saw the spinning wheel of al pastor, memories from younger years in Mexico came flooding back into my head. The pork on the slow-roasting wheel looked visually juicy and thick and the way they carved it was exactly how I witnessed in Mexico. They're like surgeons finely slicing the leanest, softest, and juiciest pork you will ever see. Also, they actually include ALL constituents: pineapple, cilantro, and onion. It's simple because the meat is so juicy that all you need aside from the above three condiments is maybe some lime juice. When I bit into it, it was a confirmation that I finally have found an authentic Mexican place in America. I've searched far and wide for something this close to the real thing in many different American cities including regions like Southern California and Texas and have never found such a close facsimile in my life. This makes all the somewhat authentic places I've been trying in Queens and Brooklyn actually look Americanized by comparison. I saw in another review by Ben L. that he called it ""pastor paradigm shift."" Those are a beautiful string of words and I love his review but I have to humbly disagree that this is the pastor paradigm shift. This is what real pastor in Mexico tastes like, all the pastor I've been eating around America is the true paradigm shift--the aberration from the norm. The pastor here firmly re-grounded me to what actual Mexican food tastes like and how far off every other taqueria I've tried in America is from getting it right. I'm not saying authentic places like this don't exist in America, because I didn't even know this existed until yesterday, but let me tell you that it is extremely rare, like finding a pregnant unicorn or something. Ever since my childhood years in Mexico, I've searched for this, and have only encountered it now over a decade laterSope de al pastor: 9.9/10 - It was HUGE and the first real sope I've had in a decade. Quesadilla de queso- 10/10- Try the quesadillas here if you want to know how far off base TGI Friday's is when they call their quesadilla a quesadilla. Notice the soft tortilla that was made crunchy through frying and the unique combination of cheeses inside. It was transcendental and a true treat. Add some of their delicious green salsa to compliment the cheese.Tacos al pastor- 10/10- The first true tacos al pastor I've tried outside of Mexico. If you haven't been to Mexico, you must try these to understand why Mexicans giggle when you order Vegan Burritos and fajitas. The meat was lean, yet lightly marbleized. It was soft throughout and you don't find that occasional crunchy piece you find in street carts, it was slow roasted all day and tender as can be. JARRITOS- they have a great selection of my favorite Mexican soda. I recommend trying the Mandarin or Fruit Punch flavors.",17,0.9983

1646,24,17,5.0,"Imagine.It's the early 90s and a twin brother and sister, about 5 years old, are hard at work in the kitchen of their family's apartment in Queens. Even when I was 5 I knew the power of food, and how a great snack is the perfect way of showing how much you love someone. Unfortunately at that age our culinary prowess was certainly lacking. My sister and I decided to serve banana splits, although we were at a loss of what was served on a banana split, except for a banana and ice cream. Improvising we decided to fry the banana in an overly greased pan, with globs of Napoleon ice cream, and garnished with black olives, and then watched as our family ate it, smiling through clenched teeth and tearing eyes.15 years and 0 banana splits later my older sister and I roll into Lula's Sweet Apothecary, an adorable vegan ice cream spot situated in Manhattan's East Village. Everything is antiquated, from the tin signs, the boxes for the toppings, and even the spoons (which are shaped like very mini shovels, how appropriate). Our server, Brad was extremely kind and walked us through building our banana split (because damned if I knew it was three scoops of ice cream, and three different toppings ""traditionally"").We decided to have ours made up of Rum Raisin, Cake Batter, and Chocolate Chocolate Chip Ice creams, topped with marshmallow, caramel, and caramelized pecans. So you can imagine how sad I was when I found out that Lula's is CASH ONLY, and I peeled open my wallet to find only one dollar and perhaps a few flies zipping out of it.Brad however didn't miss a beat, encouraging us to eat our ice cream before it melted and just run to the ATM once we're done. Which I can only describe as totally awesome on his part.This place really is a gem and everyone should consider having their dessert here, the totally guiltless cashew based ice cream (which is all made on site) doesn't have that peculiar aftertaste that soy based vegan ice creams do and is just perfect on a summer day.",22,0.9807

1648,18,15,5.0,"After my lovely but ultimately less than earth-shattering experience at sister restaurant Hide-Chan, I wasn't sure what to expect out of Totto Ramen. Early on, it'd gotten a huge amount of mainstream food blogger attention, and if there's anything I'm reverse-racist about, it's when Americans get excited about Asian restaurants. Still, I worship the Totto empire, and getting off early from work one day, I decided to make the pilgrimage to the West side.Initial signs were encouraging: short staircase down into the narrow space, explosively steaming pots behind the counter, the smell of chicken heavy in the air, a couple of Japanese cooks in bandanas shouting their welcomes at me. It was the most authentic-feeling, friendliest ramen-ya I'd been in in NYC besides the old Sapporo (whose food couldn't live up to the setting, though I have not revisited since its renovation). I nodded at the cooks and took a seat in a stool. Less than a minute later, my order was in -- the options are few, and I went with the purist choice, the Totto chicken paitan ramen. Less than two minutes after that, the bowl was in front of me.The chicken-based broth was spectacular.I thought that deserved to be in its own paragraph. I'd always assumed that the sujebi soup at Arirang in Koreatown would be the most nuclear blast of capital-C Chicken I would ever have the privilege of tasting, but Totto's paitan ramen edges it out. It's so creamy, so chickeny that it's difficult to capture the experience in words: a burst of primary colors after a lifetime in black-and-white.Ramen is the most holistic of all noodle soups, so a broth alone cannot make the bowl. Luckily, the noodles are gorgeously springy specimens, easily better than those at Ippudo, Setagaya, and, oddly, Hide-Chan. And the char siu slices are as perfect as Hide-Chan's, not only standing tall in that dynamo of a chicken broth, but melding seamlessly with it in an indescribable melange of animal flavors.A single bowl of ramen is usually more than enough to sate me, but here I ordered a kaedama, i.e., an extra helping of noodles to dump into my leftover broth. It's virtually a second bowl for $2.50. I finished it just as quickly, then noisily slurped up the remaining soup, honoring Japanese tradition as best I could.I don't give five stars for a single visit very often. But Totto Ramen serves up a bowl of ramen that I like significantly more than the pork bomb at Ippudo or the tightrope-balanced hakata of Rockmeisha. Indeed, the only two ramen bowls I've had in the States that I like more are at the holy ground of Santouka in Edgewater, NJ, and [REDACTED NYC ESTABLISHMENT HERE; YOU WILL HAVE TO TORTURE ME OR BE MY ONE TRUE LOVE TO FIND OUT]. I'm going to go even further and put Totto Ramen in the upper echelon of best solo dinner spots in the city, period. You could bring a date here, of course, but you better be ready for her tongue to taste like chicken.As I got up to leave, the usual Japanese chorus of goodbyes caressed me. For the first time in my life, instead of just bowing my head slightly, I actually turned to my ramen cook and said, ""Gochisou-sama deshita!""He smiled. ""Arigatou.""Arigatou yourself, Totto Ramen.Probability of return within 1 year: 100%",24,0.9978

1650,21,17,5.0,"This review is dedicated to all you sillies who think Joe's Shanghai has the best soup dumplings in NYC. You are mistaken, very very mistaken. In fact I think that Joe's is average Joe compared to Nan Shian (probably more accurately translated as Nan Xiang?). Nan Shian has some of the best soup dumplings I've had, second only to Din Tai Fung in Taiwan. If you like soup dumplings, make the trek to Flushing and try this place, but prepare to wait. Though they recently expanded and the restaurant is now twice as large as it was before, there is still an average 20-40 min wait for a table. After you are seated, make sure to order the soup dumplings right away. There's a 30 min wait for the dumplings to be steamed (from when you order it) but it's worth it! Besides, there are plenty of other yummies on the menu to divert your attention for those 30 minutes. My favorite dishes at Nan Shian are...... spicy beef and tripe slices (fu qi fei pian)... stir fried rice cakes with seafood (hai xian chao nian gao)... sliced beef wrapped in pancake (niu rou jia bing )and of course the star of the meal: the XLB featuring thin skins, tender pork, and rich flavorful soup. I've tried both the plain pork soup dumplings and the pork and crab ones. I prefer the pork and crab ones because the soup is a little thicker and I love the flavor that the crab adds. **It was brought to my attention that not everyone knows how to eat a soup dumpling without making a mess. So without further ado, I present to you the simple guide to eating a soup dumpling:First use the provided tongs to pinch the top part of the soup dumpling and lift slowly and GENTLY so that you don't rip the dumpling skin. Once you have successfully transported your soup dumpling from the tray to your spoon, you can pat yourself on the back because the hard part is over. Now, bite a small hole in the top of your soup dumpling and suck out the juices. If you're afraid of burning your tongue, you can dump out the juices into your spoon after biting a hole in the top. Then, after enjoying the hot soup, drizzle a little sauce and ginger on top of the dumpling and eat up!",31,0.9928

At least as far as trying new burgers goes... Not to dis my fellow cows that can taste great when prepared correctly, but it's time to watch out, because the lambs, bison, and their friends are stampeding their way, swiftly, into the world of burgers. (It kinda makes me laugh when I think about lambs and bison stampeding together, actually. Anywhozer...) I've been hearing about the Breslin's lamb burger for a while. I've seen in on TV, in photos, and even in person while sitting with my laptop in the Ace Hotel's lobby. I've heard many, many things about this burger, and none of them bad.Being that I find myself in the Ace's lobby with a fresh brew from Stumptown more than my own living room, I figured I had to finally crawl over to the Breslin and try out this burger I've heard so much about.We went and sat in the dim room and were seated immediately upon arrival, at about 5:30 when they reopen for dinner. We had to learn this the hard way, though, because we got there at 4pm, only to be told they are closed between 4-5:30 between lunch and dinner. Whatever, it could've been worse, there could have NOT been a stumptown and great couches to kill some time.The booth was comfortable, and the waitress was friendly with a semi-funny personality, the kind where she says a joke but you don't know whether to laugh at it or not because she didn't trigger laughter with a smile, smirk, nothing. We placed our simple order of two lamb burgers, which came with Thrice Fried Chips (fries, ya dummy) and cumin mayo. The food was out in about 20 minutes or so, give or take a few.The burger seems to be about 8-10 ounces, a very nice size, indeed. The problem with a lot of big burgers is how they seem to fall apart because it is slightly undercooked, but this one was cooked and seasoned PERFECTLY. The ""casing"" was great, it held in all of the juices before the first bite, and was seasoned to perfection to balance the slight gamey-ness of the lamb.The top the patty with melted feta cheese, with the lamb being Greek and all, and a few slivers of fresh red onion.The first bite was great, but just be ready for those juices to run down the burger, because those juices stir up quite a mess. Not exactly the worst kind of mess, I might add. The cumin mayo was delicious, too, and was indeed VERY cumin-y. It went along with the burger nicely, though.The fries blew me away. These might be the best fries I have had in NYC, maybe ever. Better than Pomme Frites, better than Balthazar, better than Katz's, better than Shake Shack. Thickly cut, rectangular prisms made of potato, ""Thrice fried"", of course. They were perfect fries, and the cumin mayo was a great dipping compliment to these amazing chips.All in all, this burger moves up on my list to my favorite burger, currently. Simple seasoning, perfectly cooked Medium-Rare (as they recommend and as any burger should be), delicious feta cheese and a great, great bun. The fries, like I said, are perfect. It also doesn't hurt only having to spend $17 for such a high-quality burger with great fries, rather than almost $50 at certain places. We skipped on dessert and just got a second round of Stumptown, which to me, is the best way to top off any meal.Go get this lamb burger. Now.",19,0.9996

It is nicely charred, a little dry, topped with butter sauce , queso, seasoning, and a lime.Next up is the Cuban Sandwich voted best in NY, was it? It very well could be with roasted pork, ham, swiss cheese all finely sliced with pickles and chipotle mayo. A split crispy toasted hero delivers the meaty goodness to your mouth...is that tuna I taste?The Mexican Grilled Cheese is what we would call a cheese quesadilla made with a commercial flat-iron press. What makes the one at Habana special is the green and white sauce that they generously drown the thing in. Yum. It comes in two large pieces.I washed everything down with a small yet flavorful cup of the ginger pineapple lemonade whilst sitting outside with a hayload of patrons. It was an ideal scene for this warm summer night. I did consider the $8 for a frozen mojito steep, but I will be back one day looking for refreshment.",18,0.9371
1656,25,12,5.0,"If you travel through Portugal, North to South, East or West is Aldea the type of restaurant that you will normally experience? well, is not. I truly know that. However, George Mendes has a clear Portuguese heritage not only in his name but in the way to express his cooking as well. Actually, to be accurate, Aldea has been tagged as a Iberian restaurant, Portugal and Spain, which is more appropriate based in his menu. But he has been also trained in some of the best kitchens, he has learned modern culinary technics an develop his skills under names as Berasategui or David Bouley and that, that has been imprinted on him as well. As result, sophisticated simple food. Traditional dishes based in high quality ingredients that only someone creative, formed and talented can transform in a exciting experience for your senses. I could taste a total of 6 dishes and 3 different dessert during our lunch for 4 people and everything was perfect not only the food but the service, and the ambiance as well. Aldea however seems to be a black sheep at Yelp as to me it doesn't make sense this discrepancy in the rates. Without unconsider others opinions, I can't other than give them a 5 having on mind that I still need to see how are they doing during busy times and even when 6 is a good representation, I want to try more dishes.Aldea gave me the best cheese plate I had in a long time. Obviously, your personal taste play an important role in this assertion, but among the immense variety of cheese produced either in Spain or Portugal, he chose an interesting combination that reflects not only knowledge, but a try to surprise and satisfy you. This selection must have been discussed for a while. All were creamy in texture and a progression in flavor. The strongest one I loved it; from La Serena*, similar to Torta del Casar; a cheese that you will not want to keep at home for long. Its served with membrillo (quince jelly) as the tradition dictates and walnut-raisin bread. The pear and arugula salad was maybe the most regular dish in our lunch as seems like you are not a chef is your salads doesn't include nuts and/or fruits. It was delicious, the nuts where mashed and toasted in a pan and the Mozzarella was just fantastic. Creamy, tasty and fresh. Like the difference between eating regular tofu or homemade. My main entree was the scallops served with farro risotto, cucumber and orange. The scallops were like butter and melted in my mouth instantly. But as much as I loved them, the risotto was incredible. You know that you can order this rice dish in the lunch menu? I suggest you to do it. And the orange slices over the scallops were just so refreshing and fit so well with the dish. The organic chicken breast with bok choy, mushrooms and coconut curry can be defined as surprising, satisfying, and superior quality. The meat was tender and flavorful. It looked fresh and healthy. And the sauce was so good and unexpected but complimenting the meat flavor in a way that chicken is not boring any more. But then I could taste the Spanish mackerel ""a la plantxa"" with escabeche jus and zucchini ribbons. This one I loved it. The fish seems crudo, uncooked when is presented to you but is not. A la plancha is barely cook in a pan and the look was a sign of a good escabeche, a marination for fish that is the Spanish version for Ceviche. The meat was firm but tender at the same time and the escabeche jus (juice) is a concentration of the fish flavors than enhance the dish. To finish, we also order their sea-salted chatham cod with scrambled egg, black olive and crispy potato. If there is something that I remember about my many trips to Portugal in the past for years, is my dad ordering every single time salted cod with potatoes, a featured Portuguese dish. At Aldea, it was like the one you get there keeping the traditional flavor of roasted potatoes but scale up because is was soaked in a foam that carries all the flavors of the dish. The restaurant is designed with modern taste, natural and comforting. Eating there is so pleasant. You are surrounded by blue walls and botanical. You feel so clean in here. It can be either intimate for dinner but also a destination for a business lunch. Aldea has an open kitchen and you know how we are all fascinated seeing them cooking what will be your food in a few minutes. Chef Mendes was there all the time with a bunch of chefs that looked like an army working in harmony. Considering the variability in the reviews you can just do what I did. I decided go for lunch first and give a try. 3 course menu, $25. After this as you already know, I'm gonna come back for dinner. *artisanalcheese.com/prod…",28,0.9996

We were told to enjoy the sauna and showers prior to our massages to unwind - well, thank you and about time I felt pampered at a spa!!! We were given keys to skinny high school looking lockers and changed in the same room into big white towels. Stepping into the sauna that was 173F was absolutely a wonderful sweating experience (we were given water while inside to keep hydrated) and really gives you some clarity right after showering! Showers seemed very dormy to me, but had everything you needed from shampoo to a hair cap; extremely clean and fully stocked.Then.....I meant...HIM....Nao (pronounced as NOW). My beau made that face that said ""I really don't know if I want another dude touching me"" so I took Nao and he got a girl named Janny. Then...this samurai by night and masseuse by day spoke to me...Nao: where do you feel pain?Oh Nao, I'd tell you I feel pain EVERYWHERE but my boyfriend would surely have to duel you in Yugi-Oh! And I wouldn't want to see the outcome of that so I just told him my neck and lower back.I don't remember much from that hour except a few things:1) I moaned loudly most of the time and deeply apologize if the guy in the next room thought I got a little something-something. It was mostly ""ohhhhhh"" and ""ahhhhh"" and ""right there!"" with an occasional ""ouch"" because his hands were like a bear's; crap, that does sound like we were romping around huh? 2) I drooled...like a puddle on the mat. My muscular functionality ended with the first crack of my spine and I slipped into a relaxed coma.3) I totally farted twice and didn't have the strength to apologize! I couldn't do anything to prevent it and it just escape....great going Jack...good job.::dressing after the massage of bliss::Beau: I think I might have heard you...Me: I couldn't hold it in ok?! He was pressing on my back and the pressure and yeah I farted ok?Beau: I just said I THINK; but now I know.Go NAO and NOW and expect to feel the lingering pain for two days after but you'll walk taller and feel just a bit sexier after.

The beer was great as were the sizes. I met lots of new friends. The place is pretty well decorated for the holidays. Classy decorated, not cheesy decorated. I was very impressed in general with the place and how nice the bartenders were. There are big tables so that groups of people can sit and have fun. It is a loud place, so if you want to have a quiet conversation or have a romantic night, this probably is not your place.

Each participant was given two chances to complete each trick before moving onto the next. The below are, to my mind, the five things you ought to know about ""flying"" - 1. This is NOT an athletic endeavor; the most strenuous exertion involves a little bit of flexibility, and some elementary hanging-on. Plus, you've got both a harness and a handler - a lovely barechested man that guides your trajectory with a pole, in case you can't muster the requisite momentum by LEAPING forward off the platform at go.2. This is NOT a particularly difficult endeavor. It's not like snowboarding or the Argentine tango. A more (in)appropriate analogous activity would be sex - the experiential difference between someone who's never done it, and someone who's done it one time is weirdly magnified. In other words: you WILL be able to complete tricks at the close of two hours!3. The thrill factor is low-moderate, thanks to a virtually nonexistent danger element - which is in turn thanks to the safety net, harness, barechested handler, and constant supervision by instructors. The most nerve-wrecking few seconds are probably when you're standing atop the platform, awaiting your first jump.4. Aside from socks, bring your camera, and some buds. It's a highly photogenic activity and you're gonna love your pictures. 5. This is -without question- the best organized fun I've ever had in Manhattan.

I wanted to take them home; all of them. Then there are the cheeses on display, and in front of them a wall of craft beers! A large selection of tasty brews, including Belgian ales and American microbrews. Totally unexpected and totally awesome!I even liked the music they were playing: a vintage live album by Lou Reed.David, the cheesemonger who served us, was extremely knowledgeable about both cheese and beer. They didn't have muenster, nor provolone, but David suggested oma and caciocavallo instead. They were both great suggestions.- Oma ($18/pound). This raw cow's milk cheese is made in Vermont by the Von Trapp family[2]. The appearance is similar to brie, with a washed rind; the texture is soft but firm and amazingly smooth; the taste is buttery and intense.- Emmenthaler ($14/pound). This is the real Swiss cheese, the one that is made in massive 150-200lb wheels. The appearance is light gold in color; the consistency is medium-soft; the taste has a distinctive nutty sweetness to it.- Caciocavallo ($12/pound). This cheese is originally from Sicily, and is made with the pulled curd process (similar to Mozzarella). The texture is firm and smooth, the flavor is mild and slightly salty[3].They also have some of my favorite Sardinian cheeses like Fiore Sardo (sheep's milk) and Pantaleo (goat's milk).It didn't take much of an effort to David to convince me to try a couple of beers:- 'T Gaverhopke Belgian Ale (9.8% ABV).

My friend Jeff O., the mastermind behind the 2010 Roosevelt Ave Taco Cart Crawl, decided we cap off our ceviche/LENGUA taco/fritada eating excursion (yes! I had cow tongue for the first time IN MY LIFE and it was delicious~!!!), with some frozen custard at Timmy's. I shared a small double-scoop cup with a friend and had their flavor of the day (Mocha) and Vanilla. The consistency of the custard here is velvet. It's rich, it's thick, and very much egg-based. He and I, along with other members of the taco tour, enjoyed this decadent dessert, and though their flavors are limited, I found comfort in knowing that what I got was all natural and free of preservatives. Without pause, I'd go for any one of Timmy O's 3 or 4 flavors over the heaping pile of 31 selections offered at a Baskin Robbins anytime. Best part of my experience is that Timmy graciously gave me some soaked hand towels to wash away the stickiness on my fingers. That is customer service. I'll never forget this man's kindness. With that said, I want to go back and try... maybe not a custard this time, but a peanut butter sundae!",19,0.9726

The youngling would do things such as imitate, dress like, play the same sports, eat the same things, hang out at the same places as their older counterpart. Imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery. Of course, the little brother is always picked on. Whether he is blamed for things the older brother is actually responsible for or subject to wedgies at school, these are the entitlements bestowed upon the youngling. There are no considerations or exemptions alike. As the younger sibling, you are subject to the mercy of your elder brother...Until Today!Ovest Pizzoteca (sibling restaurant of the notorious Luzzo's)... You have officially shed the belittlement of being the younger sibling and have created a new foundation of the superbly well-executed Neapolitan Pizza!I'll avoid going into detail on the decor of Ovest... If anything, the restaurant is best observed as both homey and upbeat. One note of interest, the wood fire-burning oven can be observed in the main dining room. Patrons of this establishment will find a relaxed yet tranquil feel; despite the Chelsea locale...The Food:""Alessandro"" Pizza A Cono ($9.00): THE TRUE PIZZA CONE! A perfectly baked piece of Neapolitan Dough is stuffed with Fresh Mozzarella, Prosciutto di Parma, Cherry Tomatoes, & Parmigiano Reggiano. At first bite, patrons will discover the initial taste of the Pizza A Cono to be derived from its smoky, charred crust. The toppings stuffed within the Cone provide a subtle, delicate, and earthy presence. With a strong boldness stemming from the Arugula, that's complemented by the sweetness of the perfectly ripe Cherry Tomatoes, the pizza provides a welcoming earthiness when consumed. The slight application of the Buffalo Mozzarella provided the much welcoming velvety creaminess that amplified the refreshing flavors of both the Arugula and Cherry Tomatoes. Ultimately, the ""Alessandro"" Pizza A Cono embodies the true freshness and complexity of the ingredients. What you will get with this application is a true observation and appreciation of subtle, delicate, and refreshing properties of each individual ingredient.Ovest Pizza: Picture the Margherita, now add on Buffalo Ricotta, Pepperoni, Freshly Cracked Black Pepper& Thinly Sliced Garlic... This is the foundation of the Pizza named after this establishment. A stark contrast to the delicate properties of the standard Margherita, the Ovest Pizza possesses a robust outcropping. From its initial taste, the derivation from the application is that of heat! The lightly spicy, yet welcoming, properties of the Pepperoni took center stage by presenting the stark boldness of the vividly hasty flavor. The precisely topped amounts of Buffalo Mozzarella & Ricotta provided a soothing, creaminess to the aggressive heat of the Pepperoni. Ultimately, patrons will find that the use of the contrasting ingredients to be a perfect complement, as the spiciness of the Pepperoni helped to release the excessive delicate sweetness of the Buffalo Mozzarella & Ricotta. Patrons consuming the Ovest will find an array of flavors ranging from spicy, sweet, and smoky. There is no shortage of complexity in flavors of this application.Big Brother... Little Brother... Perhaps little sibling started lifting weights and decided to fight back; as there is little doubt that Little Brother can pack a wallop... How then does Little Brother compare to Big Brother? An Apples to Apples comparison would just not be fair...Notes on Ovest:1) Takes Reservations! Although the dining room was empty at 7:30pm2) Apertivo Hour on Weekdays from 5:00pm to 7:00pm. Don't want to pay for the Pizza? The Apertivo Bar serves up small bites of their traditional Bufala Pizza, along with many other snack items.3) Check Out the Wood Burning Oven in the back.

WaW's wow factor comes from equal parts of its impressive entrance through a marble stairway, the high ceilings and stylishly appointed interiors, the welcoming and friendly service and, importantly, the abundance of wholesome food.I was here for a celebratory dinner, thanks to the thoughtful planning and patronage of a dear friend. We opted for the 'family style' tasting menu. Of note, the boiled artichokes were delicate even if a little messy to consume, three of the four cheeses were a hit, the chickpeas potpie with a puff pastry crust was excellent, as advertised, and the chocolate dessert was rich and filling.WaW is by far the best dining option in the Financial District. While the assortment might be relatively narrow for a vegetarian, and the ambience not as 'happening' as one might expect for dinner, the overall food and service quality, coupled with my friend's enthusiasm to make this a memorable experience, raise it to a solid five-star experience.",24,0.9965
1680,23,31,5.0,"My adventures with French men led me to Kenka. I had never been before and I was super excited for the cotton candy machine. But first we were to sober up with beer. Kenka has really cheap beer which sort of tastes like water. They give you little tumblers and they end up looking like apple juice glasses but you know there's a tiny bit of alcohol in there. We mulled over the cartoon menu and everything looked foreign to me. Honestly, I can't bring myself to stomach 3/4ths of the menu but it is pretty fun and I like that young people are so willing to eat various pieces of organs and innards as well as zoo animals. ""Look! They have frog!"" I tell the French men.The French men tell me that neither of them have ever had frog before and that it is a misconception that all French people eat frog. Really? Now, I am not so sure that I was even with French men that night. ""Turkey testicles!!"" I scream out. No one wants turkey testicles. The waitress walked past us carrying a tray of fried frog spread eagle much like the nekkid women on the wall. The frog reminds me of 9th grade biology class and I slightly gag. Our snacks consist of french fries (because I was with French men and they misread my telepathic messages about Pommes Frites around the corner), gyoza, and fried chicken without bones. We became sufficiently full and the pitcher was emptied. The waitress asked for our pitcher and through a miscommunication, French man orders another pitcher of beer. This delays cotton candy time for another half hour. When we decide it is finally time to go, French man's ""check"" sounds like ""chicken"". We pray that the waitress doesn't give us another round of chicken. We just want cotton candy and the bill.The cotton candy turned out to be oodles of fun and by far the best part of Kenka. There is no adult supervision and wow that spun sugar can get wild. I am barely tall enough to stare into the machine but I do so on my tippy toes and I had a hell of a time turning my chopstick into a ball of dissolving pink fluff.On a sidenote, Kenka has a wall of pachinko machines. It's just like Tao in regards to pachinko in the bathroom. In essence, Kenka is like a playground for immature young adults who enjoy feasting on fried food, gross factor, beer, porn and candy.",25,0.9856

The patio is serene and darkened, a comfortable canopy of grape tendrils gives cover, a lazy fan laps breeze into your cheeks, the Decemberists are playing in the background. A bite of creamy burrata complimented by the sweet and tang of a lightly marinated salad of strawberries and peaches, taste like summer. I could be at any great restaurant back patio in the world, but i'm right here in Williamsburg.I'm in the middle of a thought provoking meal at Traif. A newish restaurant that, judging by the light crowd on a Friday night, hasn't gained traction with the locals quite yet. Food and service like this, and I suspect that will soon change.Lightly fried sweet breads, complimented by the earthiness of artichokes and maitake mushrooms, make me wonder why all restaurants (other than Traif) tend to over-batter and over-cook their sweet breads. I'm also guiltily struck at how much sweet breads are reminiscent of Chicken McNuggets, which is maybe why they're so enjoyable.An earthy and unctuous plate of tender sauteed broccoli rabe on a bed of portabella bechemel and topped with an over easy egg could convert me into a full time vegetarian - I don't miss meat at all with this dish. A competently done cockle and conchiglie pasta, mounted with butter, flecked with truffle oil and spiked with jalapenos, tastes much lighter and cleaner than the sum of its parts. I also wonder why Traif, which is decidedly non-Italian, is running circles around most Italian restaurant's pasta.A dessert of brown sugar budino, a delicious but complicated palette of reserved notes - chocolate, sweet and saltiness - caused my palate to wildly reach for approximations. ""Where have I had this flavor profile before? Caramel corn at the county fair? Chocolate mousse at Robuchon? Where?"" I can't make up my mind, but I know this budino is damn tasty.The food is on point, the wine is flowing, and the final bill is too good too be true. I'm struck at how good the food is, how modestly it's priced, and wonder why all restaurant's can't figure out this formula. Maybe i'm not at any restaurant's back patio in the world.

The service was beyond friendly, with free tastings offered; the menu small but rich in possibility; and seating tight but available. If someone had simply handed me a scoop of ice cream from here, I would never have guessed that it was dairy free. The mint chocolate cookie was out of this world, made with real peppermint, instead of a vaguely minty synthetic flavored neon green substance, and cashew milk, which lent it all of the creaminess and structure of its dairy counterpart. Doused in gooey hot fudge sauce and served in a little glass dish, this was truly a perfect dessert.

The Afternoon In Naples---- one of many Campari based cocktails---- is amazing. It's refreshing, not too sweet and delicately handled.

The creamy mozzarella mixed with the fresh beet salad with all sorts of silly small greens. - Spreadable Salami with toasted bread: Not necessarily ""my thing""--- but simply meaty amazement, spreadable on super crisp (and warm) toasty bread. It's like a meat lovers version of a tuna fish salad- but done with this homey, savory, meeeeeaty delight. - Salami Piccante Pizza: First off, I was enchanted by the idea of the Neapolitan pizza wonder chef, Appleman, from San Fran's A16 coming to Pulino's, from the start. And I usually hate a thin crust pizza... But this pizza was beyond comprehension. The delicious crisp crust almost bit me back. It was charred, but tender on the inside-- senses thrilled with this CRISPY crunch with each bite.

1685,12,9,5.0,"I've been going to Riodizios once per year with my family for as long as I can remember. This is by far the best riodizio I have ever been to. Never have I felt that spending this kind of money is more worth it. The only caveat is, you MUST bring your appetite! I want to rate each thing I tried there in a list fashion because that's pretty much the best way to rate riodizios since you try everything. The first thing to note about this place is that it's really not hard to get a reservation. I called the night before, and we were able to secure a table for 6 people, and when we arrived, we were seated instantly. The atmosphere was classy yet not too ostentatious. There are also giant windows overlooking the street so it doesn't feel stuffy at all. The atmosphere is so important in this review because often these costly Churrascarias can be in an overly elegant and uncomfortable place, but Riodizio Tribeca avoided that and in my opinion has created a perfect balance between elegance and comfort without it getting too crazy or crowded. The drinks: Assuming you are over 21, you must try the caipirinha drink. I've been having these in Miami and in Latin American countries for a long time and this one is done right. I'm not sure of all the ingredients, but I know they use cashasa pitu rum, and the drink is phenomenal. I had planned on only getting 1, but 5 ended up being a more beneficial number to me.The salad bar:  At churrascarias, the salad bar is somewhat incidental to the actual MEAT that you're about to enjoy. It is crucial that the place has a good salad bar, however, because you want some light tastes entering your stomach before you get on to the meats. It kind of lightly introduces your stomach to the concept of digestion so that it's ready for the challenge ahead. They had a good selection of light salads, sushis, side dishes, and fruits. The tomatoes were fresh, which is good, because studies show that if you eat tomatoes before, during, and after you eat steak, it helps your stomach digest the steak since tomatoes have a high amount of digestive enzymes. The side dishes: The side dishes are a double-edged sword because some of the side dishes can taste truly incredible, yet the entire idea behind the side dishes is to load your body up with carbs so that it's difficult to eat a large amount of steak. That's why I recommend only tasting the side dishes sparingly when needed, but saving the bulk of your appetite for the meat. The mashed potatoes were out of this word and so were the cheese breads and the french fries. But, you can get all these things at other restaurants for cheap, so concentrate on the meat. The meat: (I recommend you ALWAYS ask them for a rare piece of steak if you can, you will always get the tastiest and juiciest cut that way).Picahna steak: A+ Picahna is the quintessential must-have meat at Riodizios. It's one of the best they have. It's salty, juicy, and flavorful. This one is done well. They may call it ""sirloin"" to you FYI. Prime Rib: A+ I haven't usually encountered such good prime rib at Riodizios. This was really a surprise. I think it was even juicer and tastier than the picahna. You MUST try this. Garlic Steak: A+What an incredible and unreproducible treat. The way they were able to infuse such a strong and unrepentant garlic taste without sacrificing the flavors of the meat itself is a feat among feats. Skirt steak: B+A very good steak that is well-salted and flavorful, but falls short of the others. I only recommend trying one piece of this and focusing on the above 3. Filet mignon wrapped in bacon: B-Don't use up your valuable appetite on this. The bacon is a compensatory way to make up for the fact that filet mignons tend to have less fat and therefore less flavor. Chicken: A-Extremely flavorful, this is the chicken that alters the paradigm for chickens everywhere. So juicy and perfect.  Although it's fantastic, I wouldn't recommend getting too many because your appetite will float away quickly.  Sausage: A-Just like the chicken, it's something you should definitely try, but not in copious amounts. The sausages are thick and juicy and are pretty much as good or better as most riodizios. Pork ribs: A-Another dish to try sparingly, but it's very good.Beef ribs: A+I was completely blown away by these beef ribs. I typically don't like beef ribs at riodizios because they're lacking in flavor, but these could be the best part of the meal along with the picahna and the prime ribLamb: A+ Another complete surprise coming out of left field. I love lamb, but usually in Middle Eastern settings. This is the first riodizio i've been to that makes the lamb taste just as good as the steaks you are trying.Dessert: GET THE BRAZILIAN QUINJI COCONUT CUSTARD!!! It's an absolutely breathtaking way to close this meal out. It's soft. It's sweet. It's a taste that everyone can relate to.",17,0.9994

It's a bit of a walk from my apartment, but I went to the end of nowhere (11th ave.) and was greeted by a warm, inviting little bakery smelling of fresh out of the oven treats. The smell was intoxicating. It's exactly what I want to smell every morning when I get out of bed. That and bacon. But I can't have it all, can I? Sunshine was streaming inside, through their glass windows and I saw several different newspapers scattered across their wooden booths. I fell in love instantly. After a few minutes of perusing and taking in the all the glory of this place, I immediately ordered the pizza funghi, a bombolino with vanilla custard and a savory brioche with gruyere and pancetta. And I thought the smell was arousing. The taste? Even better. The bombolino bread was soft and still chewy, while a little burst of vanilla custard oozed out. I wish they filled it more with custard, but there was a good balance between the filling and the outside. The pizza funghi was covered with slightly browned mushrooms and baked on a thin crust. It's a relatively small slice and meant to be eaten as a snack (or I think so...). It's not warm as you would expect it to be, but it was still quite satisfying. Oh, and the brioche with gruyere and pancetta was fantastic. The saltiness of the pork and cheese went perfectly with the sweetness of the brioche bread. Love. Love.Next time, if I can make it out way west again, I will be back to try their Banana Bread Pudding that was calling out my name last time, but I could sense the judging eyes of the people behind me.

1689,17,6,5.0,"Having lived in the South Florida/Miami area for almost 20 years, I thought I knew everything there is to know about the perfect Cuban Sandwich (Cubano). Sweet Cuban bread, mustard, mayo, pork, cheese, ham and pickles. Pretty easy, yet 90% of restaurants who try to perfect a Cubano still have no idea what they're doing. But, somehow, I was able to find the best Cubano in the most unlikely of places; New York City.Milanes Restaurant is located on 25th st. between 6th and 7th Ave. (closer to 7th). The burgundy awning outside is what I look for whenever I can't tell which door to walk up to. You walk in, and right away you get greeted in Spanish, no matter what you look like. This, to me, is just one of my stamps of approval; legitimacy. For $7 on special, you get a Cubano and a drink. I sat up at the bar both times to talk food with the owner. Once again, a Bobby Flay recommended spot (featured on Throwdown) does not dissappoint, not at all. Now, on to the food...Every aspect of this Cubano is perfect. It's nice when most of the flavor does not come from the mayo, mustard and cheese, but from the meats instead. The pork on this Cubano is definitely the best tasting pork I've had on a Cuban Sandwich. It is juicy, tender, and SO flavorful (the meat actually drips sometimes, although not messy). The bread is perfectly pressed and toasted. The pickles are sweet and thickly-cut, adds great texture to the sandwich. The cheese stretches and pulls with every bite you take. The sandwich is seriously perfect, better than any I've had in Miami.Although I have not tried a Cubano in Cuba due to obvious reasons, I assume this would blow most of those away, as well. It does not matter which country this pork is cooked in, it's just the best. I crave this sandwich's delicious flavor all the time after coming here, and it was even better the second time.This Dominican joint also serves up any other dishes you might assume they would, all for very cheap prices. They close at 7pm, so don't try having a late dinner there.For those of us who have been searching for legit, delicious and cheap Spanish/Dominican food, look no further.

For such high quality, you get more value for your money.Getting a good bottle from the wine list can be hit or miss,So I recommend you take advantage of No Corkage fee Mondays...I insist! For appetizers, we shared the diver sea scallops and lemongrass squid salad. Squid is amazing! The claim of this being the best dish in the house is certainly valid.The diver sea scallops were meaty and large in size, But it only came with 2 pieces too small for us to share...I'm not surprised.For entrees, the 2 gentlemen ordered the same dish. They had the roasted monkfish. It came with artichoke barigoule, tomato, basil, and leeks.I tried the fish and liked the crispy coating, but felt the flavor is a bit weak.I had the Risotta with chanterelle mushrooms, peas, parmesan, lemon, and herbs.It was too rich and creamy for me, but the taste and flavors were superb!The Mrs. had the squid ink linguine with shrimp, neck clams, chili flakes, & white wine.It was strange to see linguine with black coloring, but she said it tasted fine. For dessert, we had the vanilla panna cotta with raspberry coulis sans birthday candle.Fine with me, a team of servers serenading me is embarrassment I can't handle.Allowing me to pick the dessert was a nice gesture.I liked the vanilla flavor, but I wasn't crazy about its gelatinous texture.Overall, our dining experience was amazing.High quality ingredients & savory dishes are what I've been craving.I would love to come back here another day,Hopefully, we don't have to wait until my next birthday.",15,0.9897

Over and over and over again. However, I like tattoos. No, wait, I'm a burgeoning junkie actually. And that is why I like to get tattooed by David Sena. He has this light hand on him that makes the pain, well, less painful. Not to mention he's super friendly and actually works with your ideas to come out with something incredibly beautiful. Awesome. The shop itself is great - bright, clean with a sense of calm about it that only makes for a really untroubled experience. All the equipment used is sterile, the ink quality is very high (which makes for a lasting tattoo as opposed to one that fades over a year or two) and all the other artists are really friendly as well. My tattoos usually take about 2-3 hours, so if I am going to be in a world of hurt, I want to be that way in a place I am comfortable in.

I had heard some rumblings awhile back about a library being built in the neighborhood, but then didn't keep breast of updates. I didn't even realize where the library was going to be until I heard on NY1 that the grand opening was today. Damn, I really should read my BPC Broadsheet from now on!I, of course, hightailed it to the library to check out the new digs. It's in a prime location, across the street from the movie theater and Embassy Suites, and a few short blocks from all the local schools. Best of all, I don't have to cross the highway to get to my nearest library. Goodbye New Amsterdam Branch, hello BPC Branch! Having grown up in this neighborhood and lived here for so long, it makes me really happy that this new generation of kids will have such a wonderful resource available to them within the bounds of Battery Park City.Apparently it's the ""greenest"" library in the city, with all kinds of environmentally friendly technology in use. It's 10,000 square feet and two floors. There are tons of tables with plugs built into them, plus lots of other chairs for reading. According to the website, there are 24 public access computers, but it didn't look like that many to me. Perhaps more will be on the second floor, where the multipurpose room is situated. Right now, it looks like they still need to expand their collection - the shelves on the first floor are not nearly brimming full enough of books, and there's only a magazine section on the second floor - but I'm sure the NYPL's shrinking budget has something to do with this. There is a large children's section, though, and lots of DVDs (movies, tv shows, anime) to choose from. I may very well cancel my Netflix account if it's this convenient to rent movies in my own neighborhood!I'm also very excited to have such a beautiful local library to use as a writing spot. Free wi-fi and a clean, quiet, well-lit environment with a view - what else could I ask for? Best of all, I don't have to buy anything to use the space, and I won't reek of coffee for hours afterwards. I think I'm in love.

The restaurant has been in existence for 72 years but Keith Mcnally took over the space, revamped the menu, and filled it with Socialites, Fashion Editors, and whoever else is fortunate enough to get a direct line to Mr. McNally for a reservation (similar to the Waverly Inn) if you want a table between 6:30 and 11:30.

1708,21,10,5.0,"Blue Hill served me an absolutely fabulous meal replete with some of the freshest ingredients I ever tasted. This observation is counterbalanced by the fact that Blue Hill has the slowest service of the more than 35 Michelin starred restaurants I have been to in the city. Fortunately enough for Blue Hill, the food is worth the wait. Our table of six was split evenly between partaking in that evening's tasting menu or ordering a la carte. It was with great fortune that Blue Hill will allow both types of service at the same table -- a rarity. I opted for the 5 course tasting menu ($72) along with wine pairings ($42). Amuse Bouche 1: a rack of baby spring vegetables with greens attached. Whimsical, folksy, and delicious. Adorned only with salt, these vegetables were excellent and obviously freshly picked. The signal was clear for what lied ahead. Amuse Bouche 2: Bread. First served with butter (seemingly freshly churned) and then again later with a selection of powders and spread.  Functional but not particularly special.The waitress then visited our table and informed us that the first course of sea bass had run out. One of the three of us would have to settle for cobia. We all looked distrustfully at each other and asked to share the sea bass instead. The request went unheeded, and I wound up with the sea bass (and a complimentary glass of rose from the Loire Valley). This was probably because I was the only one doing the wine pairing. First Course: (looks at watch, we are 1 hour in at this point). The much touted sea bass served with ramps, green garlic, littleneck clams, and squid ink pasta. A perfect dish! The sea bass was perfectly cooked with lovely texture -- delicious. The ramps were in season and especially tasty. The green garlic had an important note in the dish, and the clams were great. The squid ink pasta was served as a handful of bowties, so soft, so lovely. What a resounding start. Second Course: Blue Hill Farm Egg served with dandelion greens, pancetta, and Stone Barns spinach. The egg was resplendent. It was centrally perched with arms of dandelion greens emanating from it along the plate. The pancetta added a surprising note of heat to the dish. The egg was so beautiful, I didn't want to break the yolk. Breaking the yolk though, brought the components of the dish together, and it worked wonderfully. Again, another success.Third Course: Farmer's Cross Pig served with grilled asparagus, pickled ramps, and hazelnuts. The ramps, while a repeat ingredient, were welcomed due to their inherent freshness. The pig boasted a lovely color and was remarkably tender -- so delicious. The hazelnuts served as a simple adornment atop the pig. To the side the two spears of asparagus were placed as an ""X"", and there was the bonus inclusion of pork belly. Pork belly? I was in heaven.  Another lovely dish.Fourth Course: (notices watch, we are 3 hours in at this point). With the service so noticeably slow, the kitchen provided this course to all six members of the table rather than just the three who ordered the tasting menu. The course was rhubarb and lemon thyme soup served with a fromage blanc sorbet. I know, it sounds dubious, and I never intentionally ordered rhubarb before. Too bad, because the dish worked and rhubarb can be quite good when it is fresh. The course worked well as a palate cleanser and boasted a refreshing, clean flavor. Fifth Course: Flourless chocolate cake served with chocolate, rum cream, and cocoa nib ice cream. Again, this sounded dubious, and again I was wrong. Yes, another great dish. I will spare further words of praise.All of the wine selections worked especially well. I was even pleased to have a lovely dessert wine. At the low price point, this was probably the best wine pairing in the city -- a much better bargain than ordering individually. We asked for the bill and wound everything up after 4 hours of service. We were the last table left in the restaurant, so we literally closed the place down. Leaving at 12:30am on a Monday night was a bit more than anyone bargained for. Clearly there was a problem or three in the kitchen, but I am happy to report that the food did not suffer in the least as a result. What was so remarkably special about this meal was the simplicity of the effort and the high quality of the ingredients. The chef has a sure hand and can quickly sum up what adds to a dish and what detracts from it. The farm fresh ingredients are the backdrop that makes every dish pop and stand memorable. It is a lament that we can not all eat like this every day. Highly recommend.",23,0.9994
1709,31,19,5.0,"When people think of the ""best pizza"" in New York, immediately people tend to think of places in Brooklyn or Manhattan and maybe the Bronx. Very rarely will people consider Queens, but if it were true, then Rizzo's would be the Q borough's finest representative.Truth is, it's hard to give them any less than 5 stars throughout all of my experiences. Their pies are fantastic and the service is unparalleled. I would go as far as to say the customer service is the best I've ever dealt within any pizza joint in the 5 boroughs. I've ordered this pizza from all over in Astoria, Steinway, Long Island City, and Sunnyside, and even when we were out of delivery range, Rizzo's still managed to make an exception for us. They genuinely care about the quality of every pie that leaves their kitchen and take great measures to ensure they arrive in perfect condition. Shockingly, they have offered me a refund during times at which they had the wrong topping or when I was incorrectly charged. It's hard not to be impressed with the level of service they exhibit for every customer and every pie. They have even called me on occasion to see that everything went smoothly. They specialize in thin crust pizza with both Neapolitan and Sicilian styles. The special combinations are all good, but my favorites have to be the all meat combo or the spinach + garlic. And what is it with that sauce? It's smooth in texture, with just a bit of tart while lacking the gooeyness.  The cheese is just right, not too overwhelming and complements the rest of the ingredients nicely.Delivery is decent, though they will give you an honest assessment in that most deliveries will take at least 35-40 minutes. During their busiest times it can take as much as an hour, hence, keep the orders simple and the appetites at bay. Credit cards are accepted here and the prices are reasonable, especially given the sizes of their pies. Similar to Spumoni Gardens (yelp.com/biz/l-and-b-spu…), these babies might require 4 people at minimum to finish.Ultimately, it doesn't take much to recognize why these guys are on top of their game.

1711,21,15,5.0,"With the notoriety rendered upon the majestic proprietorship over Pizza in both Manhattan & Brooklyn, one would question why such offerings are not more highly acclaimed on a little road called Arthur Avenue in the Bronx? From the ramblings of my fellow compatriots, a restaurant located on Arthur Avenue that simply goes by the name Restaurant 0-8-9 is known to serve one of the most humbling and delicious renditions of Neapolitan Pizza in all of the five boroughs. For those of us whom have been privy to this find, the restaurant is better known as Trattoria Zero Otto Nove (or Restaurant 089 in Italian).The Setting: To describe the interior confines of Trattoria Zero Otto Nove would be doing it an injustice; the decor is best observed first hand. At first entry, patrons are in the main bar area of the establishment. The modest decorations ranging from solid red tiled floors and walls gives this segment of the establishment a relaxed feel. Immediately after being escorted through the bar is the true marvel of the edifice. The 20 foot tunneled walk into the main dining room possesses a secretive and tranquil feel. From the lightly stained sand color rugged brick walls to jagged wooden oak stained doors housing the lavatories, the interior confines immediate produces a feeling of minimalism & grace. Upon immediate entry to the main dining room is where the true spectacle of Trattoria Zero Otto Nove's architectural genius comes to light. From initial observation, patrons will find that the decorative art painted on the walls depict scenes of Italian villas and daily neighborhood activities. The natural light from the clear glass roof opening allows for a candid yet serene feel to the main dining area. For those dining at Trattoria Zero Otto Nove, the decor of the establishment renders feelings of relaxation and subtlety; thus mirroring the tranquil feel to those experienced in mainland Italy.Despite the appreciation to the attention and detailed rendered to the design of the establishment, Rachel & I are here for the Pizza...Pizza 1: ""Margherita"" - Simplistic in its design is the classic Margherita Pizza. Containing San Marzano Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, and Fresh Basil, the presentation of the dish mirrors all other renditions previously consumed. What should be noted about Trattioria's rendition of this Naples classic are the aromatics stemming from this concoction. From first scent, patrons will discover a hearty and robust flavor stemming from the San Marzano tomatoes. A secondary note of buttery sweetness is detected from the Buffalo Mozzarella. At first bite, patrons will be privy to an explicit flavor profile that's comparable to many, but far exceeds anything ever consumed. The first notable detection is the slightly charred foundation of the pizza. The protrusion of subtle sweetness yet savory bite of the San Marzano Tomato Sauce are greatly subdued, yet amplified, but the rich and delicate flavor of the Buffalo Mozzarella. Patrons will find that the exertion of both sweetness and bold savory properties to work in conjunction with both the San Marzano Tomato Sauce & Buffalo Mozzarella. Although the Fresh Basil was slight in the application, the subtle hints of vulgarity derived from the refreshing properties allowed for the pungent flavors of the Margherita to truly amplify.Pizza 2: ""Caprese"" - Contrary to the exquisite and exceedingly complex flavors of the Margherita, the Caprese embodies a subtle yet well balanced flavor profile. The aromatic base of the application is best described as refreshing and earthy, with little notes of spice and boldness detected from the shaved Parmigiano Reggiano. At first bite, patrons will discover that the heartiness embodied within the Margherita isn't present with this rendition, but rather a subtle, delicate, and earthy presence. With a strong bitterness derived from the Arugula, that's complemented by the sweetness of the perfectly ripe Cherry Tomatoes, the pizza itself is transformed to a rendition that embodies a cleansing property when consumed. The slight application of the Buffalo Mozzarella provided the much welcomed buttery sweetness that amplified the earthy flavors of both the Arugula and Cherry Tomatoes. Ultimately, the Caprese pizza embodies the true earthiness and complex flavors of the ingredients used in the application. Although lacking the true heartiness of a San Marzano rich application, the Capreses embodies simplicity, which helps to amplify the natural sweetness and delicacy of the ingredients used in the application.What Pizzaiolo, Robert Paciullo, embodies with his creative rendition is that of exquisite perfection, that's complemented by the exceedingly impressive flavor base. For those venturing to Arthur Avenue, Trattoria Zero Otto Nove is a must visit. Such perfection must be sought.",23,0.999
1712,17,19,5.0,"My love for Panya is turning into a slight obsession. I could never go carb-free based on my visits to Panya alone. To be carb-free would be to dishonor Panya. It's just too good to let go of.The business hours are weird. I remember walking around one evening and it was closed. Then again, we're in New York and this is my memory I'm recollecting. It could have possibly been near midnight. In that case, the bakery hours make total sense.Another evening I came by to find a basket of day old breads. Each bag was $2.50. I got three strawberry filled danishes for the price of one. I went home and nuked them. They were divine.I indulged in their green tea cookies. Tiny, crunchy, hideously green, and full of sugar crystals... I think they should go hand in hand with a cup of tea. I had mine with a glass of water. They hardly taste like green tea while you're eating them. Two minutes later there's an aftertaste hint of green tea and it doesn't go away. God it's good.Bread. Oh Panya. I mistakenly thought the namesake meant bread (yea!) like in French. I'm so wrong. The bread is so right. The half loaves can be sliced to your liking - thin, medium, or thick. The medium is for toasting. I would think the thick works best for french toasting. Their bread is amazing.Raisin - It's sweet and smells sugary. There's more raisins in Panya's loaves than in a box of Raisin Bran. Danish- I call this bread ""Jippan"" because that's the kind my mom used to buy in San Francisco. It was magical bread. It was like a bread loaf of croissant. At Mitsuwa I bought it and it was called ""Boloniya"". I think Panya calls it Danish. It's the best thing on Earth. It tastes like butter. It's light. It's got layers of Heaven. I love this bread.I love everything at Panya. They have everything from hot food and rice wrapped in seaweed to baked goods and Hi-Chews. It's everything Japanese individually wrapped, so cute, so tasty, so sweet, so awesome.Someone stop me. I'm starting to resemble a sumo wrestler.",22,0.9924
1713,37,18,5.0,"Located on a very scenic part of Coney Island Avenue, this Turkish cafe sells freshly made baklava and what brought me here in the first place: chewy ice cream.That's right. After attending the Secret Science Club a few weeks ago[1], I learned from NYU Chemist Kent Kirshenbaum and Chef Will Goldfarb about an ice cream made in Turkey that stretches. This ice cream is made from the root of Maras Dondurma[2]. Although the plant is protected, apparently, this ice cream is a very popular snack in Turkey.Gulluoglu came up in a quick google search, and so off we were, my gf and I, on a mission to try chewy ice cream.Gulluoglu, which has been around in Turkey since 1871 and has more than 20 locations in Istanbul alone, is mainly a baklava bakery, and their ice cream is imported from Turkey. Too bad it is not made on the premises, because I've heard that people can make some pretty funny tricks with this ice cream when they serve it. Oh, well, next time I'm in Istambul, I guess.On a Saturday afternoon the place was deserted, except for two men watching Turkish soccer on a flat screen tv. VH and I sat by the fire place, and just relaxed while eating our ice cream.The ice cream ($4.95/250 gr; vanilla is the only flavor available) is of a very pearly white color, with sprinkled pistachio on top. It is served with a knife. And you do need a knife to cut it! The result is a very tasty ice cream with an incredible consistency and texture; unlike anything I've tried. Think taffy that bites you back.This place is very nice and I would definitely recommend it not just for the ice cream, but for the wonderful pastries as well. We sampled some of their baklava, and they were all excellent: crisp and not sticky, lots of flavor without the overwhelming sweetness that you sometime get with baklava. Moreover, each different baklava have different consistencies. I suggest to give up to curiosity and try a few. I particularly liked the one with chestnut inside. Their savory cookies (kuru pasta) were also excellent: shaped like mini-pretzels, they have a wonderful, flaky, consistency, and come in two flavors: with sesame seeds and with anise seeds.PS: It seems that Ilili also makes chewy ice cream: newyork.timeout.com/arti…-------------------------------------------------------------------[1] yelp.com/events/brooklyn…[2] The bulbs of this wild orchid contain a mucilaginous carbohydrate called glucomannan, which the orchids use to retain water during dry periods.When dissolved in milk, the long coiled glucomannan chains bind up and block the movement of water molecules, and thicken the milk.",40,0.9857
1714,15,14,5.0,"If you find yourself in Flushing on a frigid, windy night, there's only one way to warm up -- stuff your belly with piping hot dumplings, and lots of them. My friends and I found White Bear shuttered on a recent night. But I remembered this excellent recommendation by Melissa Z just around the corner.It took a couple address checks (and a rereading of Melissa's review) to verify that yes, hiding somewhere beyond the buckets of dried seafood, grains and herbs, there was a dumpling shop. A really excellent dumpling shop that looks just like a showroom kitchen.We took seats at the folding tables surrounding the kitchen and glanced over the menu. It's not about the usual suspects, pork & chive or pork & cabbage, at this place. Here you'll find offbeat numbers like pork & fennel, mutton or pickled vegetable dumplings.We ordered the vegetable dumplings, pork & fennel dumplings and spicy wontons (Singapore spicy dumplings?). The woman dug through various bags to assemble our order and started boiling the dumplings in the model kitchen while we snacked on a bowl of pickled vegetables.Ten minutes later, the dumplings hit the table. The pork and fennel dumplings were fantastic and unusual (though, as one other reviewer said, fennel may be a bad translation for dill) and the spicy wontons were exceptional -- perfectly acceptable stand-ins for the soft spicy pillows served up at White Bear. The vegetable dumplings were tasty but not my top pick. Next time, the mutton.Just after we finished eating, we settled up and the woman closed up shop, dragging a metal grate down. The shopkeepers smiled as they showed us the door. And as soon as it had begun, the dumpling fantasy was over, and the kitchen had disappeared. Out into the night we went, bellies bracing us against the wind.",15,0.9285
1715,41,31,5.0,"Afterwards, we sat quietly in the car. Trying to process what had just happened. It was equal parts bliss and confusion as endorphins took over the neural circuitry. ""Wow! That has to be the BEST I've had in my life"". Breathless, I could only nod in agreement. 8 months, 7 cities (coast to coast), 133 trials .... nope, not the search for the American Idol, but for the ideal cannoli. Finally, a clear winner: Villabate. I may be a tough judge, but I prefer critique over easy laughs. Even while awarding 5 stars to Madonia Bakery, I had noted that the cannolo shell added nothing to the taste. Here, at Villabate, one can appreciate that a good shell needs no embellishment or protection from a chocolate coating - it is tasteful and texturally correct on its own - neither soggy nor too flaky or thick/cookie like. And, the sheep's milk ricotta, imported from Palermo Italy, is the most delicious I've ever had! As a result, the cannolo is creamy, crunchy and has an explosion of flavors. It also has an element of mystery: is Mascarpone used in combination with the Ricotta?Villabate is named after the town in Sicily that is home to the family that runs it. It reminds one of the best that Italy has to offer - beauty, art, friendly people and excellent food. The kind of place you fall spectacularly, hopelessly, and permanently in love with. But, it wasn't love at first sight. The first time I was here (12/2008) at Andy H's recommendation (after a 3rd review update), I had tried a few pastries and left unconvinced as one could also taste the essence, not just the fruit. But, on my subsequent visits as I tried a host of items ranging from nocciola, fruit marzipan, cheesecake, seven layer cookies, chocolate spice cookie, macaroons, spumoni (better than the one at L&B!) I appreciated flourishes of genius in each. They do mix up fillings really well and so one can expect to find mousse, ricotta cream, custard, zabaglione, vanilla rum, etc. in the vast selection of pastries. While there are lots of beautiful and colorful cakes around, my favorite would be La Cassata Siciliana, made with sweet sponge, cannoli cream, and a marzipan shell topped with jellied fruits.Villabate is well known to discerning people: on Christmas Eve there was a wait for an hour and a half just to get served. And, none of the patrons looked as if they had mistaken Bensonhurst for Times Square or were holding a map. They've been shopping here for years, and most are greeted and served in Italian. ""I used to come here when it was famous as Alba Pastry Shop, but the Villabate folks were so good they drove Alba out of business"", said the woman standing behind me.That comment speaks volumes. Not only are these guys so good that they overcame a legendary competitor, but are also courteous to have retained the goodwill of the customers. Truly, if you were to wake me up in the middle of the night and ask me which NYC bakeries would be leaders in service (courtesy, efficiency, knowledge, helpfulness) the two that would come to mind are Madonia and Villabate.The location is perhaps the only thing which prevents me from visiting on a more frequent basis. But, that too has its advantages in terms of wallet friendliness. Villabate has a $20 minimum for credit card purchases, and honestly just to meet that minimum I have had to keep on buying more pastries! When I got home and looked at my receipt for 10 pastries ($23.00), I realized that most ranged between $2.00 - 2.50, which would be half of what comparable pastries would cost in Manhattan.Those of you disappointed by the missing obligatory cinematic reference in a cannoli review, might want to visit around Easter as There Will Be Blood - in the Sanguinaccio (chocolate pudding with fresh pig blood). Whoever thought eating chocolate pudding could be an adventure, eh?",44,0.9992
1716,45,40,5.0,"Di Fara's: I love, I love, I love.It inspires me to new heights of craziness in my food eating adventures. I've been going on and off since 2003, my first time as a wide eyed, gawking tourist from Canada. I brought my boyfriend, he sat and waited at a table doing a slow burn while I held our place in line all the while soaking in the theatrics of a true pizzaiolo. Since that virgin visit, I've returned a couple of times each year, enough to have the Q train schedule burned into my memory. Enough to endure hour long subway rides back and forth. Enough to know that I should bring a Tolstoy tome to pass the time between commute and pizza making. A couple of years ago I ventured out and I made the sore mistake of not calling beforehand so I braved freezing temperatures and a windy snow storm only to arrive at a closed storefront. Arrgghh! So I was on a Di Fara's hiatus for the last two years. Enough with the erratic hours and the gong-show waits I thought, time to move on. Although I could never help but wonder when I would make my next return to my own personal pizza mecca. I went back this past week seizing the great snowstorm of February as a capital pizza eating opportunity. And yes I called beforehand. The place is as charmingly worn down as it was before with a fresh lick of green paint inside. And Dom, the septuagenarian pizza maestro is still sporting the same worn plaid shirt and cap, churning out pies effortlessly. Maggie -his wry daughter mans the counter and tries to keep the crowds in check with her expediting. I had a 20 minute wait for a pie this visit but other visits I've waited upwards of an hour and half to two hours. So yeah, don't go on the weekends or prime dinnertime. It's a zoo and it requires all the patience and zen of a Jedi master to endure the madness. Like Luke you'll find yourself tempted by the dark side when others (most likely the uninitiated or uncouth) cut in front or steal a pizza out of turn only to have your eyes cut into their backs like daggers. But the pizza here is first rate in my books. Yes, it's not true authentic Neapolitan style neither pliable or fluffy soft in its dough. Tender, chewy crisp is more appropriate. The thin crust barely strong enough to support the dynamite melange of cheese on top. Added extra virgin olive oil almost gilds the lily, a dangerous pool of cheese and oil. If Dom is extra generous with the oil, the dough groans to support the embarrassment of riches, like strippers at a frat boy party. Oil, cheese and more oil: sometimes you'll get a pie with a sheen not unlike a pimply teenager from Fat city. It's a flavorful greasy mess though not for everyone. The tomato sauce is suitably herbaceous and sweet and the dusting of grana padano on top lends a sweet nuttiness to the mozz below. Finally, a sprinkle of the specially imported basil gives a nice verdant freshness to each pie, I couldn't imagine having a slice without some of that good stuff. So yes, lots of love for this pizza despite all the pains. I love, I love, I love.",44,0.9984

1718,25,20,5.0,"Let me please tell you about one of the best nights NYC has ever shown this suburban girl.Bump into my Big Crush from college. Ask him out on a date. Consult Yelp. End up at Voza. The ambiance is as cozy and intimate as my living room bedecked with candles. We relax, drink red wine, and become disproportionately excited when we are served free mini-bowls of split pea soup with bacon (amazing). The owner/head chef takes a seat at our table; we offer him some wine (he declines). We decide on broiled salmon with creamy polenta and the chicken parmigiana. I'm not sure I have ever enjoyed waiting for dinner as much as I did at Voza - let alone eating it. The kitchen is part of the dining area, so you feel as if your food is being created especially for you by someone you know. Not en masse, and not in a busy, messy, hidden back room. Delicious smells wafted through the restaurant and I wanted to know what everyone was eating. Thing is, I was so enthralled by the company, and the absolute masterpiece of my own dish, that I totally forgot about everyone else.There is definitely something to be said for having a long, relaxing dinner - the wine, the waiting, relishing the conversation of your company!!

1719,14,19,5.0,"Dear Waitress Natalie,Why must you scold me so for using my iPhone at the table? Don't you realize I'm addicted to pizza and need to tell the world (via Yelp app, of course) that I was in mid-Lucali binge?And then, to make matters worse, you presented ME with, of all things, the bill. You clearly just like to kick me when I'm down, mid-post-pizza coma. That is just WRONG, and what's worse is, I think you kind of enjoyed it.Well, truth be told, Natalie was quite fetching, brought us glasses for our BYO and recommended the spicy sausage as a substitute for the pepperoni that was not available. She also gave us the DL on her upcoming trip to exotic locations (Poland and Ibiza, among others), and gave me all name and manner of grief, despite my overwhelming charm and good looks. Ah, yes, the waitresses are indeed engaging (despite a review or two to the contrary), but as to the nitty, let's talk about Roberto B.'s review for a second:My good man, you can't be serious. You could possibly have walked around NYC, seen the manifold insipid, lifeless, flaccid, uninspired and unappealing pizza offerings and somehow, after sinking your teeth into a slice of this pie, say with a straight face that it's just ""good,"" ""totally acceptable,"" but not great? Pshaw. Your credibility is now officially nil, despite your vehement declarations of intimate knowledge of the etymology and origin of all things pizza. Ha! Your review should indeed be dismissed, as you suggested it might be.Oh, and did you actually comment on the demeanor of the waitresses? You want Mark to SMILE when he's making the pies?! Would that make you FEEL better about the pizza? Tell me you're joking. Pretty please.I mean, perhaps you came on a bad night, I don't know; in any event, you clearly are not from around these here parts from what I can tell. Growing up here, it was pretty much accepted that if you came out of a restaurant not feeling like the waitress had spit in your food, you really hadn't been to New York City at all. This kinder, gentler Noo Yawk stuff has got to go. Get the faaaaaaaahhhk over yourself. Wait...no ESPRESSO? You poor thing! How WILL you survive? Would you even deign to make the same comment about Di Fara? They have no espresso machine at all! Off, off, OFF WITH THEIR HEADS, I SAY!Let's stick to the facts about this pizza:It was absolutely fantastico. The crust was crispy and the flavor confluence from the cheeses was enough to keep me sitting and eating pizza until underverse come (translation: a long freakin' time, according to Riddick). The only slight complaint I would lodge is that the basil should be spread across the pie and even shredded and it isn't, in a manner more akin to methodology of the proprietor's mentor, Dom DiMarco. The basil is an important flavor component and should be experienced on every slice. In truth, that's just a small complaint about a pie that pays serious homage to a great pizza, and yet succeeds at being just a little different at the same time. Among the notable differences, the crust is crispier and holds up better under the weight of the ingredients than the Di Fara pizza (I don't mind a slightly less resilient crust, myself, but I'm just sayin'). We had spicy sausage and garlic on our pie, and it was savory, tangy, and spectacular. I am looking forward to a return visit for a different variety of pie, and a heaping helping of grief from Natalie. I imagine I'll have to wait until she's back from her world travels for that, but I'm sure it'll be worth it.Hey Roberto, eh? Quit breakin' freakin' bawls ovah heeeyaah.

Through intangibles such as amiable hosting, splendid seating, and an uncanny skill of waiting on tables, live jazz (every Sunday night and possibly during the weekdays), a vibrant environment, which all help to produce a phenomenal atmosphere. Arturo's does this impeccably. Because it is so popular, your average wait time will directly correlate depending upon your party size. There's plenty of two-seaters but not too many spots to seat a party of five or six. Patience is always rewarded here. I've gotten the large Arturo's Fiesta almost every time and have never been disappointed. Sausage, peppers, onions. Classic.

Tyron Park and the Cloisters. My parents and I wandered up here the other day and they thoroughly enjoyed their first visit. Mom's impression: ""...tranquil and removed from the hustle and bustle of the city....even the buildings themselves really made you feel you were back in medieval times.""* Meanwhile--this being my second time here--I still thought of Python's Holy Grail...and kept waiting for Patsy to gallop around the corner with his coconuts...but I digress.As for the museum, it is filled with religious artifacts from various regions in France, Spain and Germany, there's a lot to take in and absorb. One can get a little dizzy reading each piece's placards if you don't know your history (::coughs:: me, for example). So, my method of enjoying the museum was to appreciate the individual pieces for their craftsmanship--stained glass windows, wood and marble carvings, etc. The marble and stone carved columns in the cloisters themselves are a marvel of stone masonry. I pictured myself wandering around late 12th century France, in the Benedictine abbey of Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert (founded in 804 by Guilhem) contemplating life. Additionally, I think my favorite room in the museum is the one that houses the infamous Unicorn Tapestries. Part of the attraction is that so little is known about the history of the woven works of art. No one knows who made them or commissioned them.Outside, there are three gardens to enjoy, each of them unique: the Cuxa Cloister Garth Garden which has medieval species mixed in with modern plants, the Bonneforte Cloister Herb Garden which has over 400 species of herbs and plants. The herbs are labeled ""To touch,"" and ""Poisonous, do not touch."" There were also four quince trees (which I've never seen!). The third cloister garden, the Trie, has a small fountain and plants that are native to European woodlands and meadows. Lots of butterflies around here too.

1725,10,6,5.0,"*Warning this review is mad long. You might want to settle down with a nice cup of tea before you start reading*With consistent five star reviews, I've been dying to come here ever since I joined yelp. And after getting my haircut here this weekend, I'm joining the five star brigade... but, I didn't always feel this way. In fact, when I first left the salon, I was considering giving this place less than a five star (oh the horror!). Lemme 'splain...I walked in and no one really acknowledged me. The person at the front desk was on the phone, and I was just standing there awkwardly. Soon enough though, someone came and took my coat and asked who I was here to see yadda yadda. I had an appointment with Tom at 1pm, but he was running late and we didn't get started until ten minutes later. I mean I can understand, since they were all very busy... but it was kind of a shitty start to something I was super super excited about, and had really high hopes for. The majority of the haircut experience was by far the best I've ever had. Tom's really smart about hair, in ways that i never knew were possible. He noticed that my hair's only wavy in some places, that it was cut ""A line"", that one side of my hair was longer than the other (suggested it was bc my last hair stylist was right handed). He even showed me his ergonomic scissors! It was all going swimmingly until the very end. He flat ironed my hair to make sure it was all even (awesome), but somewhere between then and finished product.. things got weird. I don't really know how it happened.. something like, I asked him to angle it a little more.. he did a little and asked if I liked it.. I said I did... but then next thing I knew there were too many angles everywhere and my hair looked crazy weird. At this point we were already 5 minutes past, and his next appointment was waiting for him. Anyway, I walked out feeling not too good about my cut. Tom suggested that i just wasn't used to it yet, and that I'll get used to how it looks.... meeeh, skeptical feelings everywhere... OKAY, so why am I still joining the five star brigade? Because Tom was right! After I went home, I un-straightened my hair.. put back that natural wave I usually have... and wow, it looked amazingly awesome. Like AMAZINGLY AWESOME. Like, wow my hair has never looked so good before.. wowowowow.  And now the more I check it out, and play around with it, the more I love it. So, after a lot of contemplation, I decided on a 5-star rating because I came here for an awesome haircut and i got exactly that. I mean, I don't know what else I could ask for. And, looking back... I don't think anyone was excessively rude or anything, given the time pressured circumstances. So yeah, A+ Whistle... even if I didn't think so right away ;o)",17,0.9973

Because I am not a 80 year old who enjoys eating dinner at 5PM nor am I cool enough to be out at 11PM on a school night. So when the suggestion of Spotted Pig on MLK came up, I was disdainful.We grabbed a few beers at the nearby White Horse Tavern while making bets on college basketball via our smartphones like the degenerate gamblers we are and surprisingly enough, the hour wait flew by. The reservationist called my boyfriend promptly at one hour later and said ""We have a table open for two...but it's a pretty romantic spot. Are you a couple or just friends?"" I sort of loved that she asked us this. We took the romantic seat which wasn' really romantic given you're squished next to other diners on either side of you but at this point, we were famished. Deviled eggs were an OBV choice as was the chicken liver toast. The eggs were tasty but paled in comparison to the creamy and decadent chicken liver toast. Heaped with delicious chicken innards, this is the stuff culinary dreams are made of. Even my nonadventurous eater of a boyfriend declared this was the best (well, only) chicken liver toast he had ever consumed.We shared the famous Roquefort burger with shoe string fries and we decided to order a side of kale for our greens. Fortunately for me, the kale was drenched in bacon fat. Fine by me. The burger was interesting - from a meat perspective, it was perfectly juicy and flavorful. I did find the Roquefort to be a tad overpowering at times. Spotted Pig, despite your clunky interior and no reservation policy, you (and the chicken liver toast) will always have a fond place in my heart.

1733,12,13,5.0,"Preface: The hair gods were smiling on me, so I got everything below for free. I had the opportunity to step in as a ""hair model"" for an Arrojo class for visiting hairdressers, taught by Nick and some of his team. I knew that I'd need to be open-minded in terms letting Nick demonstrate the cut he wanted to for the class. Bring it on! I've always been a hair chameleon and hello: Nick's a visionary. Aside from his work as a TV personality, he's built a thriving empire in the midst of challenging times -- including a studio, a full range of products, comprehensive education / cosmetology programs and presence on social media channels. In other words, he can get his hands on my hair anytime! Of course, you probably also know that KRey's nothing if not a pushover for bearded, flirty, foreign men in the service industry, so I was done before I stepped in the doors ;-)I digress...I went in twice the week ahead of my cut. First up was a consultation with Nick (to give him a sense of what my hair's like, as opposed to a normal consult in which he'd assess what the client wanted). Next, I was booked for complimentary highlights with Ashley. She's technically a ""stylist"" (relatively junior in their food chain), but Nick trusts her and it's clear why. Ashley was precise, personable and artful. She took her time, sectioned my hair and removed the foils / shampooed my tresses at different times as she felt they were finished, as opposed to all at once. Highlights and a blow dry with her are approx. $115 (pre-tip). Not ""cheap,"" but I'd say she's a great value considering their new hires are selected from an intense (22 month!) training program. So Ashley spent more time in Nick's school than my husband did getting his master's..I'd say she's well-qualified :-)Finally, the day came for the big cut. It was quite an experience to be seated in front of a few dozen professionals who'd come to watch Nick & co. do their thing. I saw several innovative / edgy cuts and styles demonstrated. Most of the talk was way beyond my level of comprehension, but I've had fun showing off my ""undercut,"" bang-a-liscious bob (complete with super-short, hidden pieces under longer ones to eliminate bulk and help hair to move better). Even though they didn't owe me a thing, after my hair was styled in a fashion-forward way (read: not appropriate for everyday life) Nick personally offered to flat-iron it during the class break so I could leave with a more wearable style I'd be confident showing off. A man who commands $500-a-cut took the time to make sure I (Ms.-wasn't-giving-them-a-dime) was pleased!Obviously, I'm now predisposed to drink the Kool-Aid, but I eyed their clientele during my three visits and saw one contemporary, creative style walk out after another. And although you'll see lots of tattoos, tight jeans, piercings and ""out-there"" looks from the staff, everyone was down-to-earth and client-focused. If you can book a cut with Nick, go for it, but otherwise rest assured that everyone there is well-equipped to give your look an update and make you feel sensational.",21,0.9932
1734,12,4,5.0,"I recently had the great privilege to take Natasha to Daniel Boulud's eponymous restaurant to celebrate her birthday. The restaurant has recently been promoted in the Michelin hierarchy with it now garnering three stars, assuring that it is among the very best restaurants in the world (41st in fact by last year's rankings). In such rarefied air, the expectation was that I could stand to do little better than this. The elaborate and memorable meal we had more than confirmed this conclusion. The meal began with a trio of amuse bouches. The theme was cauliflower. The tripartite arrangement draped across the center of my fine china plate was visually striking. To the left, the cauliflower complemented mackerel and to the right it complemented a small bite of shrimp. In the middle the cauliflower was made into a small taste of soup that was balanced in texture with a cracker spoon. The flavors were delicate and interesting. Impressive given that I generally do not like cauliflower.For the first course, I had the duo of Florida frog legs. This was a gamble for me having been quite disappointed in the past with the frog legs at Jean Georges. Surely at Daniel they would fare better with this preparation. Indeed! The presentation was elaborate and gorgeous. Two frog leg lollipops flanked either end of an elliptical plate. The gulf between was filled in with spinach (both fresh and pureed), mushrooms, and crispy shallot rings. The plate was made complete by a tableside serving of two dollops of kamut berries accentuated with black garlic. The kamut berries, a first for me, were simply exceptional. An innocuous whole grain, these berries took on a prominent role in this dish. They were an excellent way to bring a taste of butter to the dish through alternative means. The frog legs themselves were not so diminutive here, and I found them perfectly prepared. Further, they were nicely accompanied by the earthiness of the mushrooms and fresh burst of green coming from the spinach. A perfect dish all around and among my all time favorites. For the second course, I had the trio of milk fed pig from Quebec. The trio was comprised of a roasted chop, an oblong parallelepiped of ham dotted with Romanesco, and a squat cube of smoked pork belly. All of the proteins were gorgeously prepared. My love for pork belly continues, and I was pleased with the smokiness of this particular specimen. The chop was striking with its delicious meat emanating from the Frenched bone, and its impressive size dwarfing the pork belly. The ham was okay, but I did not enjoy the frequent interruption by the Romanesco. This was more distracting than appetizing. Generally though, this was a solid dish; but I would probably be inclined to order differently upon my next visit. For dessert, I had the warm guanagja chocolate coulant. The cake was garnished with a gold leaf and housed delicious liquid caramel. A streak of chocolate connected it the far end of the plate where a complementary ellipsoid of milk sorbet could be found. Simple, delicious, and a touch of luxury. A second dessert was then brought out in Natasha's honor replete with her name written on the plate in chocolate, sorbet, confectionary delights, and a lone lit candle awaiting the bated breath of a wishful young lady. Compliments of the chef of course, and a lovely way to honor her on this occasion. The mignardises were less than substantial here. On a small rectangular silver platter, we were offered a pre-selected set of six small bite desserts including macaroons. Additionally madeleines were offered. In addition to the meal, we opted for the wine pairing. Our sommelier was especially friendly and engaging. He accentuated the festive nature of our visit and included selections of champagne, rose, and pinot noir. Because both of our courses were paired with a Pinot Noir, he even encouraged us to swap glasses mid-course to compare the selection from Oregon to the selection from France as it enhanced the flavors in our respective dishes. I loved the enthusiasm and the great knowledge he brought to our table. All around, the service was impeccable and consistent with the very high standards one expects of a three star restaurant. The decor was luxurious and grand. Sitting side by side in our banquette, we were afforded a view of the main floor while still remaining aloof. Across the divider from us, our dinner neighbors were none other than Howard Stern and his wife. Whether you are a billionaire or a mere mortal hoping to celebrate a special occasion, a grand time will be had here. Highly recommend. The three course prix-fixe menu is $105 per person, and the wine pairing is an additional $60 per person.",16,0.9991

Having not known it was there, one would easily walk by the entrance on three to four occasions before locating its entry way. The front door itself blends into that of the neighborhoods, thus adding to the allure and mystique of this establishment.Upon entry into Milk and Honey, two velvet black curtains need to be surmounting in order to get a glimmer of the interior confines. After overcoming the task of wrestling the two heavy velvet curtains, the hostess requested our name to confirm the reservation. We were seated at a booth immediately past the bartender's station.I'll start by emphasizing the interior confines of Milk & Honey. The initial impression of the establishment is the opaque and menacing nature of the color absent darkness is fueled by the subtle candle lighting. Patrons at Milk and Honey will find that the visual perception of the restaurant must be observed from a point blank standpoint. Walking through Milk and Honey is also a slight feat; the establishment itself is extremely small, with a width of approximately 6 feet from wall to wall. Still, the surreal feel of the establishment did add a slight majestic yet tranquility to the atmosphere. Milk and Honey is a cocktail lounge, thus, cocktails is what the locale should be focused.Drink 1: ""The Business"" - Three simple ingredients... Gin, Honey, & Lime. That's it! The drink itself was remarkably refreshing. The slight drizzle of honey and lime provided a much welcoming amplification of the heavy bodied Gin flavors in the drink. What should be emphasized in the remarkable drinkability of the cocktail, the smoothness of the consumption process revealed almost no distortion in the ingredients.Drink 2: ""Aviation 1"" - Calvados, Cassis, Absinthe, Lime. Not sure if either the Calvados or Cassis is the violet portion of this cocktail but the violet additive helped to italicize the Gin flavor of this cocktail. Generally, Aviations previously consumed during my tenure have been bold and brash. Luckily, Milk and Honey's rendition revealed a refined equilibrium of flavors for which a delicate palate enticing sensation was observed.Two Drinks... $30.00. Nothing to see, tons to drink! That's the allure of Milk and Honey and that's all that is. I should further emphasize that Milk and Honey is indeed a cocktail lounge. Most patrons attending M&H are there for cocktails. Despite the incessant rules and obligations that are mentioned on the website, the overall perception of M&H is that it's a laid back, high end cocktail emphasis establishment that those who enjoy a superb cocktail would frequent.Needless to say, I need to get back in here again!",27,0.9779

I had coat service (where they take off/put on your coat) and once my friends and I were seated, we were treated like royalty. The number of people attending to us outnumbered us 2:1, one apologized to my friend when he blocked his way as he walked to the bathroom and the waiters even gave us ample time to photograph our dishes before explaining to us what they were. God forbid they spoke while we were being paparazzi. Dining at The Modern requires patience. A meal here could set you back as long as five hours. Towards the end of our dinner, we were rushing to get out of there to make a show. What a pity. Now that I think back on it, I really appreciate the experience at The Modern. It's one of luxury that warrants time to be set aside. The Chef and Seasonal Tasting Menu was more than we could handle. Between the three of us we had 15 different dishes all of which had decided they wanted to be one of a kind, a show piece and so flavorful that they would leave a lasting impression on us. We created our own wine pairing and even got half glasses to accompany certain dishes. The sommelier was quite friendly, extremely knowledgeable, and very accessible. While a meal at The Modern is high class, it is definitely not snooty.The Modern used the finest ingredients in all of it's dishes. The pictures alone don't do the food justice. To sum it up, this is what we had:- Amuse-bouche of palmiers, fried lima beans, and corn panna cotta w/ crispy lentils and tapioca in tomato water- Heirloom Tomato Terrine with Micro Basil and Spicy Tomato Sorbet- Foie Gras Terrine Flavored with Juniper Marinated Raisins, Pistachio Joconde- Tartare of Hamachi, Yellowfin Tuna and Watermelon with Mirin, Verjus, Daikon Radish and Ginger- Tartare of Yellowfin Tuna and Diver Scallops Seasoned with Yellowstone River Caviar- Chilled Cucumber Soup with Alaskan King Crab- Ravioli of Escargot with Slow Poached Quail Eggs, Escargot Caviar and Mustard Greens- Halibut in a Zucchini Blossom with Cardamom Jus- Roasted Maine Lobster with Sweet Corn, Baby Fennel and Basil- Chorizo-Crusted Codfish with White Coco Bean Purée and Harissa Oil- Sullivan County Foie Gras with Fresh Peas, Banana and Almond Cream- Black Angus Beef Tenderloin with Parsley Root Purée and Lobster Mushroom- Pennsylvania Duck Breast with Black Trumpet Marmalade, ""Fleischschneke"", and Banyuls Jus- pineapple puree, watermelon, and cream- miniature ice cream cones- Warm Fig Tart with Balsamic Reduction, Pine Nuts and Olive Oil Ice Cream - macarons, truffles, pistacio cupcakes- espresso chocolates- Milk Chocolate and Hazelnut Dacquoise with Raspberry Sorbet- Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Strawberry Soup, Tomato Marmalade and Pistachio Ice CreamIs that not over indulgent for three people? I tried everything and my favorite was the lobster. My least favorite was the foie gras. It was the size of a filet mignon. A little bit goes a long way in this case. I could only eat half. The spacing between courses was perfect except at the end when we told them we were in a rush to leave. That was when they paused twice as long to give us dessert. It was like a punishment for leaving. All was forgotten when they gave us surprise miniature vanilla ice cream cones topped with strawberry syrup. I near cried tears of joy and my smile was so big you could have thrown the cone in my mouth and I would have swallowed it whole.Ah The Modern. French-American cuisine never looked and tasted this good. They even gave us parting gifts of pound cake. Lastly, I won't dwell too much on the ill designed co-ed sterile bathrooms. I was not a fan. It wasn't pretty and the lighting was not flattering. I'll stick with the food and service at The Modern.",29,0.9928
1743,26,18,5.0,"I was really excited the last few days before this Meatball Shop opened. I walked by, peeking in windows. I lit up at the sight of a new mention of this Meatball Shop in blogs and the NY Times. It became an obsession. As my iCal clearly alerted me this morning- the day had arrived: ""Grand opening of Meatball Shop"" (all day event, with TWO reminder alerts)While I got takeout I have to say: The space, the vibe, the lighting, the precious barstool real estate.. All perfect for a fun night out, in this temple of meatballs. It's actually a very sexy wine bar, undercover. The staff handled this crazy pitchfork-in-hand meatball mob like magic. Everyone was bustling around, working hard- and they truly weren't afraid to laugh. It was opening night, after all. Wine list is extremely reasonable.. I enjoyed my Sauvignon Blanc, as my order was prepared. My boyfriend loved his spicy pork meatball hero- which comes on phenomenal Il Forno bread (Crunchy and toasted- yet soft and chewy inside). Such amazing flavors of the nutty provolone, the warm spicy pork, the delicious bread. The salad, which accompanies the hero, is of arugula- with shaved apple slices and a simple vinaigrette. My chicken meatballs with mushroom sauce were DELICIOUS! So tender- I even tasted a hint of truffle oil in the sauce. We split a platter of beef meatballs- atop amazing risotto .. with a side of golden, buttery polenta (which had a little spice). Sauce spilling out over the entire platter... with fresh basil and succulent chunks of tomato.. garlic love. The sauces here are phenomenal- and I truly urge you to try the Classic T and the Mushroom sauces... Especially with a nice slice of focaccia on the side, as a wonderful sauce delivery vehicle.This giant meatball feast was around $30. Entirely reasonable for the amazing quality and concept.I'm glad my Grandmother doesn't really come on Yelp.com... Because it might break her heart knowing how much I love these meatballs, in absence of hers.",35,0.9977
1744,34,30,5.0,"This is the place I kept going back and tried all the cocktails in the menu and more(?).. And trust me, out of all you-call-and-find-me-or-go-somewhere-else speakeasy-ishes I've been (Little Branch, M&H, PDT, Mayhuel, Raines Law, Flatiron, Apotek and etc etc etc).. even though Pegu Club isn't quite one of speakeasies, it is the one place where I never had a hit-or-miss drinks with constantly developing new drink menus. Fresh Ingredients, beautiful presentations & the most well balanced drinks of all. Maybe that's why I stay at the bar like alcoholics in this place. ;+ errrrrrrrr....... But there are more to this place that makes me always have good time without much shh-shh requirement.Pegu uniquely offers a variety of solutions to swing your mood quite instantly - how? read the below.When you feel your life is too boring, start with 'Pisco Punch' for some bitter-sweet punch. If that is not sweet enough, try 'French Pearl' made with Ansinthe & rock candy syrup. Well, If that's too sweet for you, try ""Jamaican firefly to add some bitterness with Dark RumNow, If that's too bitter, try Gin-Gin-Mule to add some fresh mint sourness. And, If all of the above is not adventurous enough and now you feel like killing Bill, try 'Kill Devil' to knock the bad in you with this strong masculine drink......... Then,  if you still feel that the drinks aren't enough, watch Kenta making some cocktails, the You Tube video flaunting mixologist is a hard shaker. Though, he is one shy star with one hell of killer smile.Finally, if you feel that there is not enough love in this world, sit at the bar and order drinks to be served by the bartender with hundreds of ""Love Love Love"" written all over his neck tie. Why do I keep going back even I tried all the cocktails in the menu? Because I want to steal the ""Pegu Cocktail Bible"" at the bar shelves. Are you with me?P.S. Those bartenders know how to treat customers.. also you can be a taster for their new and spontaneous drink inventions - so stay at the bar.",35,-0.805
1745,23,17,5.0,"Ever since I saw Oldboy, I've been curious what it would be like stuffing a live octopus in my mouth -- is it as terrifying as it looks in the movie?video.google.com/videopl…But that curiosity was largely forgotten until I sat down at Sik Gaek and took a good look at the menu. When I saw ""live octopus,"" I knew we had to try it, regardless of market price ($20). It's not exactly like that terrifying scene in the film, because here they serve it neatly chopped and squirming on a bed of lettuce with sliced jalapeno and garlic atop as garnish, with a spicy dipping sauce and another of sesame oil & salt. Still, the sight of the plate is arresting.It tastes as fresh as you'd imagine a wriggling octopus to be, and extremely chewy. It also feels like you've just eaten something that would make you invincible for a while in a video game...a strangely potent food.Before going invincible, we had eaten the standard starter here, three eggs fried in a small oily pan at your table stove, which your waiter starts cooking the minute you sit down. While we ate this he also brought us four enormous raw clams, juicy and delicious. After that a seafood pancake, I believe the best I've ever had, exploding with the fresh flavors of different seafood and vegetables.We followed that with the huge seafood stew. Get the spicy one, with a bubbling red broth, stacked high with lobster, crabs, clams and mussels. Inside, if you dig deep, you'll find bean sprouts, noodles, calamari, bits of fish, rice rolls, and some exciting additions like fish ovaries and seasquirts. It's safe to say I'm not a fan of the last two, but try them at least.We drank a bottle of Cham Isul during the meal, and afterward one of the waiters brought us a lovely cold cucumber drink, a sort of agua fresca Korean style. I haven't mentioned the service, but the waitstaff here are the kindest you could wish for -- everyone was courteous, smiling and eager to explain what the stranger ingredients were in the stew. And for those reviewers who say the staff speaks only limited English, any Korean who knows ""seasquirt"" could be teaching the language in my opinion.Another reason I'd bump this up to six stars if I could -- when we first arrived to the packed restaurant, someone (possibly the owner) brought a plate of freshly fried calamari for everyone in the waiting area to snack on. It really doesn't get any better than this for Korean home cooking! All of this for $30 a person.",20,0.9855
1746,26,40,5.0,"Gramercy/Murray Hill/Kips Bay CHINESE TAKEOUT WinnerLast night I looked inside my freezer and saw veggie burgers and vegetables galore. I decided to blame my next bad decision on my hangover and made a date with some Chinese takeout and some SNL. My roommate suggested I call J East. Since I'm kind of loyal to Mee Noodle, I thought twice about it but then decided out with the old and in with the new.Can we talk about the specials? We're going to talk about the specials now.For like $8 you can get:- pork fried rice- an egg roll- Kung Po Chicken or whatever entree you'd likeIt's such a deal. And the quality and quantity of Chinese delivery cannot be beat. It's really enough for two people. Or three meals for me. It's so delicious that you'll want to eat all of it in one sitting, though, I swear. But don't. Try to have some control. Although last night after watching Joseph Gordon-Levitt host SNL and realizing that he's probably 1,000% gay and therefore NOT my future husband, I was tempted to go all the way with my Chinese takeout. But I saved some for today. And I'm glad I did.

1747,25,11,5.0,"I like sushi but am not a sushi buff and have not been to Masa, Yasuda or some of the other ""best"" sushi places in Manhattan let alone Japan. But rarely have I ever had a dining experience like I did with the $50 omakase at Jewel Bako. The fish was fresh, the offerings were plentiful, and the omakase shattered a few preconceptions I had about eating sushi at a good Japanese restaurant: Preconception #1: You get the same service at the sushi bar that you do at a table. Wrong. Following the advice of other yelpers, we made sure to get seats at the sushi bar and it was so worth it. We watched head chef Yoshi carefully craft each piece of sushi for us. Unlike table service, he served us the sushi one piece at a time, which allowed us to savor each piece. Yoshi provided us with a description of each fish we tasted, answered our questions, and provided us with an education that no menu could provide.  Preconception #2: Sushi is never filling and always leads to late night pizza. Before the meal, I even told my g/f to prepare to eat something after. Not with Bako's $50 omakase. We started with a silky green pea-flavored tofu amuse, then a miso soup, and had our first piece of sushi. 15 fresh, tasty, and interesting pieces later, a huge rice ball had formed and expanded in my stomach, and I could barely walk out.Preconception #3: Omakase at a sushi place means submitting to a merciless chef who doesn't care for what you like. Definitely not with Chef Yoshi. Before he gave us our first piece, he asked us whether we had any favorites or if we had dislikes. I had no preferences but my g/f liked amberjack (kampachi). Over the next 15 pieces, Yoshi navigated us through a masterful progression of sushi that included two types of kampachi, amazing otoro and chutoro, uni, seared salmon, and a unique snapper/shiso leaf piece. This omakase was the perfect balance of going out of our comfort zone but maintaining some control of our meal. Preconception #4: Sushi is not worth the price. Before I got the bill, I was convinced that the waitress thought we had gotten the $100 omakase. $50 is a lot of money but when you believe your meal is more expensive than what you paid for, that is what you call a deal. Where else can you have 15 fresh and eye-opening pieces of sushi, served piece by piece to you by a kind and caring chef. Where can you be introduced to more than 10 types of seafood, artfully prepared. Where can you have a conversation with your chef about the food you're about to eat, and learn more about sushi.",30,0.996

And of course we couldn't just have 10ozs of pure beef. Gotta have a few starters to wet the palette - all that cleaning and mending to the cave is hard work! So we ordered the fried pickles and the spinach/artichoke dip and they both vanished within about 4 minutes. What a wonderful surprise the pastrami was with the pickles, and placating our veggie friend (oh, the horror!) the dip with, dare I say, vegetables by way of endives was delectable - perfectly cheesy.

No, this isn't a negative review...but I think I can now say who is responsible for any extra weight I may gain from going here.*I was coming back from a shopping excursion at a local grocery store when I thought to myself, ""Hey, isn't Baked around here? I should get a couple sweets to share with my parents."" This is when I did a double take, drove by and circled the block for a parking space. I think I practically skipped to the bakery, based on all the good reviews.I bought a vegan lime pistachio cookie, a apricot rosemary bar and a chocolate cloud cookie. I then returned to the car and figured, ""Well, I should at least sample them, right?""** The vegan lime cookie was quite lime-y and fragrant tasting (but not overpowering), thick, yet light and somewhat crisp. The chocolate cloud cookie was....*heaven*!! Thick, moist, dense, almost like dark chocolate fudgey pudding and chocolate chips combined in the dough. I could definitely see going into a chocolate coma from eating this in its entirety in one sitting. Ho-ly frak! But my absolute favorite was the apricot rosemary bar. Butter-flour crust with just a touch of rosemary and a layer of apricots in an almost jelly-preserves form, sprinkled with a crumbled oat topping. I never would have thought of this combination, but it works! The buttery crust melts in your mouth and the apricot pairs extremely well with the rosemary. (Unless you're not a rosemary fan, then this isn't the bar for you).The remains of the cookies and bar are sitting in my fridge at the moment.

1753,26,13,5.0,"Walking around Red Hook, I get the strange pre-epiphanic feeling of a Pynchon novel (especially walking past the Waste Nought store), where everything seems infused with cryptic meaning. The neighborhood's nighttime character has something insidious and Wasteland-ish, but also playful and absurd, like a video game of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, complete with shadowy figures smoking in foggy alleys...That said, Sunny's is a magical oasis of maritime love. Everything about the place, like most everything about Red Hook, has a sightly askew, boozy, water-warped feel that makes me love it all the more: the hardwood floors slant down toward the bar; the springs and stuffings inside the booths splay out in all directions; the back room is junk-full of ropes and old crates of beer from the once-functional kitchen. Nautical artwork is everywhere you look (some of it by Sunny hisself) - even the bartender has a kindly merman charm. Maybe it's the bourbon talking, but it's hard to leave Sunny's without falling in love: be it with the bar itself, the neighborhood, the amazing Wednesday night band or the Saturday bluegrass sessions. I even love the soap in the bathroom.If you can't stomach the trek out here, then stay in Park Slope! It's off-the-grid-ness is part of the charming reward of the place; it wouldn't be such an oasis if it were easy to access, or open normal hours.

Cones has edged out Sundaes & Cones for my favorite ice cream in New York, and Scoops (LA) and Bi-Rite (SF) to claim the spot of the best ice cream I have ever tasted in my 20+ years as an ice cream enthusiast. This is ice cream that makes you temporarily lose control of mind and body. Tourettes-inducing, infantilizing, discombobulating flavor. To quote Chandler, it's ice cream to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window.I'm a sample whore. Really. Line up some novel treats and see if I don't sleep with whatever lies between to get to the other side. As such, I was fully ready to dismiss and even dislike this place with its two-sample regime. It turns out that it hardly matters, because I have gone enough times in the first fiery month of our affair to taste a whole range.It was love at first hazelnut. No games, no teasing - just bold, bracing, abandoned flavor that made me weak in the knees. Cones churns smooth beautiful ice cream that you taste with every sensing nerve in nose and mouth as it melts slow and languorous on your tongue. Hazelnut is my #1, but being for the most part a 3-scoops girl, I've been around the block. I have yet to be disappointed by any of the thirds and fourths in our menages a quatres.

1756,16,8,5.0,"So my Peruvian friend Jose took two of my buddies and I here the other night. Jose is quite opinionated about Peruvian food and the quality of ceviche. Apparently this is one of the few places in the city that both meets his standards and is very authentic. We had to try it. The four of us sat at one of the tables outside. +1 Star for the outdoor seating. It was a nice temperate New York summer evening at around 6 PM. Is there anything better than enjoying great seafood and people watching in the Village on a night like that?We started with the 3 C's of Peruvian appetizers: Ceviche, Choros a la Chalaca, y Causa. The Ceviche Clasico de Pescado was delicious. Nice big pieces of white fish and plenty of onions and corn swimming around in the lime juice. Ceviche has got to be the best summer appetizer of all time. It's so refreshing and plays very nicely with beer. The Choros a la Chalaca are mussels marinated with lime juice and stuffed with finely chopped cilantro, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and corn. They were quite good. The Choros appetizer also comes with 12 mussels which is plenty to share with a group. This was my first experience with Causa. Causa is like a mashed potato cake mixed with lemon juice. Panca gives you three cakes, one topped with shrimp, one topped with crab, and one topped with octopus. They were all tasty but the acidity from the lemon in the potatoes mixed with the lime from the fish was a bit much for me. Maybe next time I'll try the chicken causa.For entrees, we got the Lomo Soltado, the Jalea, and the Seco de Cordero . Lomo Soltado is of course stir fried steak, tomatoes, onions, french fries, and rice garnished with a pinch of finely chopped cilantro. It was excellent. The meat was tender and this dish was perfectly balanced. The Jalea is my favorite Peruvian dish because it reminds me of the food I ate in Richmond Virginia. In our parlance, it's a big ol' fish fry wit' calamari, shrimp, octopus, and fish. Lord have mercy! The Seco de Cordero is a lamb shank cooked low and slow in a cilantro stew. It was served with potatoes, sweet peas, and yellow beans. Dear God! The lamb was perfectly cooked and literally fell off of the bone. I highly recommend this place.",23,0.9955

We saw The Good Girl and walked in to WLO. That was quite a few years ago. When did The Good Girl come out? 2002? Ever since then I have had dozens and dozens and dozens of dinners here. We even had a private party for 20 upstairs (fun! shoes off, pillow seating, great service, etc etc). I definitely am a creature of habit when it comes to this place.

And that was one painful scrubbing I got..

1760,15,16,5.0,"I find it amusing when people make such a big deal about there being only one vegetarian option on the menu... um, welcome to my life! The majority of restaurants in the upper echelon of regard have only one vegetarian option--they just don't make a public spectacle about it like David Chang's trendy ride on the pork wave. By offering (at least) one substantiated vegetarian dish on their tiny menu, Momofuku becomes one of the **very few** NYC noodles houses that is vegetarian friendly! Personally, I find it charming that the chef is selecting my dish for me. I suffer from none of the ""maybe I picked the wrong dish for me"" guilt that comes along with not enjoying a meal at such a renown restaurant. So, rejoice vegetarians! Do not heed misdirected claims from idiotic self-proclaimed ""carnivores"" that this food bar does not welcome you. Whatever distaste the Momofuku brand has for your lifestyle does not show in the Ginger Scallion Noodles. yelp.com/biz_photos/HfJh… Heavy flaccid noodles dressed in a classic oil/vinegar/shoyu emulsion spiked with the title ingredients generously fill the deep bowl. Unlike other reviewers here, I didn't think the noodles were too salty--richly salted, yes--pairing perfectly with the quick pickled cucumbers, soft bamboo and seared cauliflower. I also shared the Roasted Rice Cakes (essentially don bokki) pan seared tender nuggets of gluttonous rice flour glazed in a vivid sweet chili sauce (made with dashi per the Momofuku cookbook) and adorned with scallions and pale sesame... all the decadence of pork baos turned inside out. yelp.com/biz_photos/HfJh… So please have no fear, and brings your (non prim donna) vegetarian friends here!",18,0.9666
1761,23,22,5.0,"When I was a kid, I had fried chicken every day for lunch from the time I was in first grade through the end of sixth grade. Then when I was in high school, little old Lucy from Jamaica came into our lives. She worked around our house (she scored me weed), and she made the best pan fried chicken ever, mon. Spicy, crispy, juicy and highly addictive. In the years since, I've traveled around the world, sampling fried chicken in food stalls across SE Asia, in the back alleys of mercados in Latin America, and all over this great land of ours. My point is that I may not know much, but I do know good fried chicken. And Charles' Pan Fried Chicken - which recently reopened in Harlem under a new name after a car smashed into its buffet about a year ago -- serves up superb fried chicken. I made the trek to this poultry mecca on a recent December night. For about $15, you get a choice of two sides and as much chicken as you want, along with a drink (lemonade, mmmm) and dessert. I grabbed a paper plate and plied it with two wings, a thigh and a leg, along with rice and pinto beans. Even though this wasn't a fresh batch, the chicken was lightly crispy on the outside, perfectly moist inside, and not greasy at all. Then Charles Gabriel - the Man, the Legend - walked in from the kitchen next door, toting a giant metal tray packed with fried chicken galore. After learning his trade in his native North Carolina, Charles has been cranking out these birds in NYC for 10 years now. ""There's some fresh chicken right there,"" he encouraged me, in his southern drawl, as I leaped to the display case and snatched a breast, another wing, leg and thigh. Ohmygodthisissuchgoodshitmmmm. Meanwhile Mrs. Charles was telling the story about the crazy crash that occurred last winter and forced the place to shut down. ""The car came right through the front window and landed right about here,"" she said, pointing to the back of the buffet table. ""The driver was a 19-year-girl, who was driving her boyfriend's father's car. Craziest thing I ever saw!""I was nearly finished with my meal when King Charles reappeared with yet another batch (my lucky day!!). Stuffed but still determined, I hopped back to the buffet and picked out my favorite breast, fresh as a newborn baby. Moments like this, it's what life is all about. Red velvet cake was the cap on a most memorable meal. Yes, in my opinion, this is the BEST BIRD IN TOWN! - I said goodnight and stepped out to the street.

I become so focused that I turn into Tarzan, swinging from skyscraper to skyscraper. Spiderman has nothing on me when I'm hungry.There are three serving sizes: small, medium, and large. Not to get all Goldilocks on you, but the small is just too small, and the large might actually freeze my brain (because, hello, as if I'm SHARING), so the medium is juuust right.Also, I love toppings. Each one costs $0.95, but if you order a medium or large, you can have three toppings at a discount. It's a much better deal than getting a small with more than two toppings.Like most people have said, the fruit is REAL good. I probably have the wrong approach to my diet, but I decided that I'd get my daily serving of fruit via the fro-yo. I prefer blueberries, strawberries, and peaches.

1765,17,7,5.0,"Michelin madness continues with a visit to this 1 star sushi house on the UES. Madness is the key word in that sentence, because it encapsulates Gari's approach to sushi from a purist's perspective. Indeed, should you partake in an omakase menu here, you will be offered one delicious piece of sushi after another, and none of them will be like anything you have had in your life, whether in terms of presentation, choice of ingredients, or taste. Eating here is a phenomenal experience, but it really requires an open mind and an appreciation for the chef's instincts.The omakase normally has 10 selections, but you must indicate when you want to stop. As such, I actually pressed on to 11 selections in total. My memory is a little foggy, but this about how it went:  - Toro tuna with grated daikon. The toro was absolutely delicious, but it was definitely undercut by the strong taste of the daikon. Basically I regarded this debut as a warning shot that all is not right here. Crowd pleasers are not beyond tampering with, so sit up and pay attention.   - Shrimp with ceviche. This was very nicely done. The shrimp was perfectly cooked maintaining its natural sweetness. The ceviche proved a perfect complement adding nuanced flavors.  Successful, though perhaps predictably so. - Black cod with miso sauce. An obvious classic pairing, but not one I witnessed in sushi. Why has no one thought of doing this before?- Tuna with tofu cream. Very nice. The tofu was very fresh and worked well in this pairing.- Squid with uni sauce. Nice contrast in texture. I surprisingly picked up hints of peanut butter in the uni sauce. If that is not bold, I don't know what is.- Snapper with salad of greens and lotus root. This is basically a re-imagining of a first course salad plate through the eyes of a sushi chef. This worked rather nicely, but I did find the salad piled a bit high which made it difficult, though still possible, to eat in one bite.- Toro tuna with BBQ sauce. Brilliant stroke. I was really taken with this selection. Who knew that toro could be more decadent than it already is? The smokiness from the sauce infused its flavor well. This was perhaps the star of the night.- Yellowtail with minced jalapeno. Again, very nice contrast in texture. The jalapeno was especially fresh, and provided a mild heat to the dish. Very good.- Salmon with sauteed tomato. Physically the largest selection, I was a bit uncertain about how to approach it. It turns out that it is possible to eat this in one bite, but it is a bit awkward. Also, I am not particularly partial to sauteed tomatoes, so I was very skeptical that this dish would be a success. But surprised I was! This worked quite well. I love culinary surprises like that. - Mystery selection involving, I think tuna tartare. As good as the last dish was, I still wanted to end on a high note. I challenged the chef to create one additional selection for me. I remember it being quite good -- fantastic in fact. But even as I look at the photo of what I had, I can not remember the ingredients of the dish. That is fine of course. I will relish the mystery of that great selection.- There was one additional selection in the course of this omakase, but I can not remember what it was. Over all, the sushi here, if served in the original way, would have been of a very high caliber comparable to what can be found at places like Kanoyama or Jewel Bako. But the bold and innovative approach to recreate recognizable dishes in sushi form, that challenges the customer to try unusual flavor pairings, that forces the eater to contemplate new and interesting textures in a food that is thought to be well understood is what really makes this place remarkable. It is certainly not for everyone, but any sushi aficionado needs to try it at least once to challenge what they think they know about sushi. I know I was surprised more than once in the course of my dinner, and I think you will be too.Aside from the food, I can offer up a few practical observations that may be beneficial to the future customer. - Try to reserve in advance. The place is unusually small and always busy. You can walk in without a reservation and get a seat at the bar, but you will not likely be as lucky as we were. - When I say the place is small, I mean really small. Waiting at the door, I actually had to back up to let leaving customers properly exit as there was no room for two people to stand abreast along the very narrow entrance. - Be prepared for a high price tag. A simple meal for two with drinks will run you about $200.Enjoy!",25,0.9993

Well, I mused, it was but to be expected that plus sizes would prevail in the neighborhood, given the unprecedented number of bakeries per square mile in the Little Italy of Bronx!As I stood in front of Morrone Pastry waiting for my partners-in-crime to arrive, I re-read the reviews for Madonia. ""Best bread and cannolis"" danced off the iphone screen, and I was so tempted that upon meeting Champagne Frank, I immediately brought up Madonia. Frank who also has a sweet tooth didn't need any convincing: ""no harm in taking a look"".No sooner had we walked in and surveyed all the breads (Jalapeno, Olive, Prosciutto, etc.) on display that I noted from the corner of my eyes that Frank had already ordered the chocolate drizzled cookie, and was evaluating bread options. ""Wow, what happened to just taking a look"", I thought as I placed my own order for a pound of Italian butter cookies, Pignoli, Amaretti, biscotti, etc. The serving lady politely packed everything and thanked us courteously as we left. As we were leaving, I mentioned to Frank, that in our excitement we had forgotten to sample their celebrated cannoli.We went back, and the lady took out the shells and piped in the ricotta cheese fresh into them. Frank took a bite and gushed how great the ricotta cheese tasted, much like frosting. As I bit into the crunchy shell, I too realized that the texture of the cheese was dense, semi-freddo like, and while not too sugary sweet brought out a great balance of citrus and chocolate chips in the flavor. Exceptional!However, while the shell was not soggy, frankly it did not add anything to my enjoyment of the cannoli. To its credit, the crisp shell didn't flake all over as is the case with some other famous cannoli places that pipe in ricotta (I am looking at you Rocco's). Madonia regularly wins accolades for the best cannoli in the city. It quite possibly deserves the accolade as Veniero's cannoli are not piped in fresh, even if their ricotta cheese similarly tastes fantastic! I will reserve judgment here till I've gone back and sampled the cannoli at a couple of famous Italian bakeries in Brooklyn.For my money's worth, Madonia has some of the best Italian cookies in town. While not a big fan of their biscotti (other than Pistachio Chocolate), my love for their Coco Cashew cookie is fast approaching that for Levain's cookies. The textural variations (one bite crunchy and the next fudgy!), nuttiness, and cocoa all come together wonderfully. Another delightfully rich cookie is Mario's Special - with chocolate chip, walnut and coconut, again due to the flavor and texture variations. Please note that these are nothing like Levain's cookies, though best-in-class in their own right!But, before you commit yourself to a contractual relationship with Madonia, do remember that it will extract its pound of flesh in return. Or, rather, add (at the very least) a pound of flesh from your returns. Let the huge billboard serve as the Surgeon General's warning, for no Portia will be able to bail you out! :)",32,0.999
1771,30,26,5.0,"MY TOP 3 THINGS EVER: Family, fantastic food and love. I was completely immersed in the three from the moment I sat down for my birthday dinner at Bozu. I've been sitting on this review for about a month. It's hard to come up with the words to describe such a perfect experience. Our server was a complete joy. I had chatted with him for a good five minutes on the phone discussing the tasting menu that my family would be enjoying. He paid attention to every detail, from my sister's nut allergy to the fact that my grandmother is not the biggest fan of all things spicy (what a pity..). It was no surprise to me that his attention to the little things translated to our in-restaurant experience. After ordering our divine mango margaritas (sans alcohol for those who do not drink) , we were presented with our first course. Several bowls of VERY thinly sliced lotus root, in some kind of soy/sesame sauce. I've had lotus root before and thought it was decent, but this was fantastic! Nutty, savory, and slightly crunchy - a wonderful introduction to the culinary delights that Bozu has to offer. 2nd Course - Tofu SaladThis tofu was unlike any tofu I've had in my life. This salad is presented as a sort of Japanese spin on a Caprese salad. The tofu is almost reminiscent of cream cheese, and complemented perfectly by the basil infused soy sauce dressing, tomatoes, and avocado. It's a creamy and fresh taste explosion. DIVINE. 3rd Course: Stuffed Mushrooms These aren't your great aunt's ""Famous Stuffed Mushrooms"". This is not what she serves at her dinner parties. These are heaven in mushroom caps! There's no way to describe how these are better than any stuffed mushrooms, but they are. Trust me. 4th Course: Rice Croquettes Fried carbs! Doesn't get any better than this! Sage and squash stuffed balls of rice, fried to a golden crisp. Some people at the table weren't ecstatic about this dish, but I thought the flavors were on point - perfect for fall and 100% comforting. 5th Course: Tuna TatakiTUNA TUNA TUNA. HOLY CRAP. Some of the best tuna I've ever tasted. AND WE WERE HERE ON A SUNDAY! The grape & plum sorbet was an incredible accompaniment to the almost stained glass-looking tuna. Rare & silky, this course was a SERIOUS hit.6th course: Sushi Bombs (Spicy McBomb & Shiro Bomb)Bliss. Pure bliss. Ecstasy. Rainbows, hearts, stars and puppies exploded all around me as the sushi bombs graced my tongue. Both pink & white tuna were incredible. I would change nothing about these, other than to make them available to me whenever I please. The shape, the melt in your mouth, heaven sent tuna, the accoutrements (kataifi, ginger sauce, spicy mayo), the quality wasabi...this is the kind of sushi that haunts your dreams. 7th Course: Japanese Fried ChickenThe only miss of the evening. This tasted like a bizarre Japanese take on popcorn chicken. I found myself biting into many a gristly piece through the strangely dense fried shell, and found the flavor of the dressing to be strange and confusing. It wasn't delicious. I was surprised that our fabulous server said that it was one of the best items on the menu. Although I was disappointed by this course I in no way let it affect my opinion of the establishment. 8th Course Steak, with asparagus and fingerling potatoes. HELL to the YES. This steak was cooked to perfection, served with sage-y potatoes and fresh, expertly cooked asparagus. A dream, and an interesting departure from the rest of the menu! EXTRA COURSE...ORDERED BY UNLUCKY HERSELFPORK BETTY - Definitely a renamed version of the classic dish, buta kakuni. This pork belly was UNREAL. Cooked in sake & sweet soy sauce, with a dab of wasabi sauce on each piece, this course was so rich it was nearly a chore to indulge after our intense meal. Still, we carried on, and clutched our stomachs at the thought of...DESSERTBozu graciously allowed my grandmother to bring in her famous (Martha Stewart famous!) chocolate cake. He placed the candles on the cake, my family sang, and we thought we were good to go. We were mistaken. The server rushed back to ask us if we would mind going through that rigamaroll again. He explained that a Japanese TV  crew was filming a segment on the restaurant, and wanted footage of the birthday ceremony. We agreed, and I put on my best TV face, andsucked in the 9 courses of gut. After that amazing meal and realizing how wonderfully I do have it, it was difficult for me to even make one wish, forget two!

1772,29,18,5.0,"Review Dedication: Brooklyn's Finest CM! Peter D! After reading his review of Luigi's, the pizzeria sparked many thoughts of wanting to try their pizza. Without the Brooklyn CM's indirect suggestion, this review would not have happened.There's a tall tale legend that the Mozzarella used at Luigi's is about 100 years old. Word has it, back in the days of immigrant voyages to and from native Italy (a time when luggage was not inspected), the grandfather of the legendary owner of Luigi's would bring back mozzarella from the mainland in mass quantities. The mozzarella that was brought back is apparently used in the pizza today.Of course, I will not speculate as to whether this legend is true. For starters, I hope it isn't. Can anyone imagine consuming one week old mozzarella, let alone something that's a century old? Didn't think so...A venture to Luigi's was not to confirm this legend, nor was it to dine at an establishment where the movie ""Big Daddy"" was filmed. So what was the reason for going to Luigi's? My mechanic is a block away from the Pizzeria and Yours Truly was in need of lunch. Yep... That's it. Alright, so Peter D had a little indirect push with this one. Aren't recommendations from friends the ones most noteworthy?Arriving at Luigi's revealed a surprising site... NO LINE! This came as a shock as most patrons that have dined here before me warned of the 10 to 15 minute wait. Nevertheless, the petite surprise was welcoming. Good pizza that required no wait.Walking into Luigi's provided a slight feeling of claustrophobia yet excitement. For starters, the front counter area is small. Luckily, the petite nature of the ordering counter allows for patrons to view the creation of each individual pizza by the owner, Giovanni. On this particular occasion, two renditions were available for purchase...- Plain Slice - $2.25- Fresh Mozzarella Slice - $2.75Thus... I began to order one of each.Seating in the back of the establishment was small and quaint. The section is available for approximately 10 people segmented into 2 tables of 4 and 2 tables of 2. Most patrons order slices made by Giovanni and eat standing in front of the establishment (a la... Artichoke Pizzeria in Manhattan). Nevertheless, the pizzeria was empty, and a table immediately behind the gas oven was available.Plain Slice: Perfectly balanced in both texture and flavor! To start, the crust possessed a beautiful contrast between crunchiness and a soft doughy texture. There was no smokiness or excessive char stemming from the crust. What you do get is something that's remarkably flakey, but possessing an abundance of crispiness. The tomato sauce was full of flavor in both the structure and balance. A heavy robust detection of salt, pepper, and oregano were evident with each sampling. The processed mozzarella topping was the definitive statement for this slice. With its slight gooeyness and saltiness, the flavors of the mozzarella helped to further amplify the already hearty tomato sauce. Furthermore, the processed mozzarella had a subdued level of oil renderings that was by no means burdensome. The slight excess in oil provided the welcoming balance in flavor to bring all elements of the composition together. Simply put, one of the best plain slices one can consume.Fresh Mozzarella Slice: Similar in application to the Plain Slice, the difference stems mainly from the Fresh Mozzarella topping and a slight drizzle of Herb Pesto. Contrary to the robust and hearty nature of the plain slice, the Fresh Mozzarella used in this application allowed for a slight contrast in flavors, stemming from the robust structure of the tomato sauce with that of the subtle sweetness of the fresh mozzarella. The contrasting flavors worked to create a welcomed disparity in flavors that made the slice more pungent in nature. Ultimately, the Fresh Mozzarella slice is finished only by the drizzle of Herb Pesto. The components of the pesto itself are speculative, but hints of basil, salt, and garlic were evident during taste detection. The pesto provided a much welcoming complex flavor stemming from the velvety / buttery texture of the Extra Virgin Olive Oil while supplying a powerful earthiness in the Basil used for the Pesto. Ultimately, the Fresh Mozzarella Slice is robust, complex, and full of flavor.Leaving the restaurant after consumption revealed a line of about 15 people. Perhaps we arrived at the right time. Nevertheless, Giovanni's renderings are often worth the wait, more frequent than not.Notes:- Cash Only! $5.00 worth of Pizza doesn't need to be debited / charged- Wait times, anywhere from 0 to 15 minutes- Best combination?

In vulgar terms, I felt like Kermit the frog playing grab-ass with Miss Piggy, pure porky perfection! The Bo Ssam dinner included bibb lettuce, rice, briny oysters, kimchi and a trio of sauces: pureed kimchi, ssam jang and ginger-scallion. A tiny squirt bottle of sriracha provided the necessary heat. I had a fun time assembling my wraps, each one was different from the other owing to the various combos of meat and sauce. The cocktails are fantastic here as well, I imbibed in several of their sake lemonades: a tart sweet concoction. Please I can has som more?!

Okay, not quite, but almost.I'm going through a major quarter life crisis. I hit 25 last month and it was paaaainful. I said to my friends, 'No going out. No celebrating. If I act like it doesn't exist, it never happened.' I can no longer say I'm in my early twenties. Oh wait, now I can rent a car. Perfect. Enter CARNIVAL: A bar plus Coney Island plus nightclub?! By day, amusement center for all ages; by night, 21 and over. Genius. We entered the 5th floor through a hallway of funhouse mirrors and continued to the carnival games and lounge. At first I was apprehensive. It seemed too quiet and casual. Where's the spectacle, the pizazz, the sparkle?! Enter the $70 'DUNK TANK': 2 gallons of a liquor and fruit juice concoction. The cocktail waitress brought it out and I gave it the once-over, 'Psh.. I could drink this in my sleep', except the four of us chugged and chugged and we didn't get anywhere. The never ending drink! Aaah now I'm starting to see the magic. Enter the GAMES: $4 per game, hoowee pricey! But I played and I actually won! ME! I jumped up and down like a kid at my first town carnival and presented my winnings, a real goldfish in a baggy, to my friends. I forced the bf to take a pic of my new friend and me. But then I had second thoughts, what am I going to do with a fish?! I brought it back to the game booth.'I'm sorry. Can I uhm... trade the fish for a stuffed animal?''But why? You don't like the fish?!''No, I do! I just... I don't think I'd be a very good fish mommy!!!

1785,23,14,5.0,"Aburiya has the privilege to be one of my few 5 with just one visit and honestly I don think I'm doing wrong since I was blown away from food to service to ambiance. The modest entrance doesn't reflects at all what you will find once you get inside. I think I was the only Caucasian there, maybe someone else hiding in the second dinning room that I couldn't check very well. They have semi-private rooms for small groups (4-6 ppl) and two common dinning rooms with tables for 2-4 people. The one in the back includes the bar kitchen where the guys are preparing the food that will bring you to heaven. Deco wise, just Japanese, classic, elegant and simple. The service was excellent, polite, friendly and very helpful. Our waiter keep asking us how was everything, made recommendations and I think he had some special attention because I was clearly the strange element in that scenario, so he wanted to teach and please us more. I'd resume Aburiya as traditional, authentic and the kind that I'd expect at Japan.. that hopefully I'll discover some day. They have an endless Sake and Shochu offer. Japanese beers, white and red wines, regular cocktails and champagne.. And not alcoholic drinks as well. We order Oolong Tea Cocktail, which is Shochu with oolong tea served cold and in glasses full of ice. It was very refreshing. My friend knows Japanese much better than me so he order everything also because the menu will take your words away. I was a little lost. They are specialized in Izakaya Japanese Tapas Style of food. Apparently Aburiya change the menu depending of the season and the availability of the ingredients, this dinner was 2 weeks ago, and so I'd suggest that you ask your waiter the specials or new items in the menu. Even I was lost.. there was two things flashing in the menu to my eyes: Homemade Tofu in Bamboo Basket and Kimchi grilled Octopus.. ok, ok, this is more Korean.. but come on, you already know me. How I could resist.. and no, my cheeks are not red now. The tofu was amazing, smooth, creamy, delicate in flavor; Aburiya tofu stole the first position in my rank to the one that I got at EN Japanese Brasserie. It comes with three different types of salt, including wasabi powder that I loved. The octopus was amazing as well. Perfectly grilled and spicy as I like. We also order crab croquettes. It was good, fried of course but not oily, a thin coat and creamy stuff .. I'm not a fan of croquettes but it was one of my grandma specialities so I know when its good. The Salmon was amazing. They serve the piece with Kama (collar), very fresh and the inside was semi-cooked and lightly sauced to keep the real flavor. But Monkfish liver and the Sashimi were the ones that makes me more happy. I never had Monkfish liver before, and its gonna be a regular in my orders. Lets see how is it in another places. The one at Aburiya was great.. I think it was served with Ponzu (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An…). For Sashimi we got Toro and Uni. The pieces were huge, super-fresh and full of flavor..Ahhh thats why I like Japanese food.Having Menchanko-Tei for ramen/noodle soup. Geisha for Sushi. Omen for innovation.

Everything else I ordered or tried was very good to excellent. I like that the sides are not afterthoughts as they are in many bbq places. The creole potato salad was great. It had a very nice tang to it sort of a cross between a deviled egg and potato salad. The mac & cheese was a little soupier than I'm accustomed to, but still tasted good. I love the dry rub ribs, tender, juicy without much fat. I liked them dry but a variety of sauces are available if you like your ribs wet. The spicy sausage was well..... a spicy sausage. Not as hot as a texas hot link, but very good.

Suffice to say they were all delicious. One I remember was yellowfin tuna marinated in grapefruit juice, with rice noodles, sesame seeds, cilantro and slices of grapefruit. Another was salmon with mango and a sauce that made us lick the bowl it came in. The wine list was indeed reasonable and we tried a Chardonnay/Gewurztraminer blend (from Uruguay, no less) that was tasty (even if my companion found it a bit heavy on the oak), and a blush Cava that was quite refreshing with the ceviche. The palm fans waving back and forth were dreamy, and took me right back to my recent excursion to the Long Bar at Raffles in Singapore, which has rafts of them waving back and forth as well, and I believe is where they originated.The staff was helpful and welcoming, the space is tight but cozy, and the music is good. We talked to the chef quite a bit, who was doing most of his preparation right in front of us behind the bar. He apparently was the chef at Bond Street at one time, and said he finds this to be a much more relaxing and fun place to work. It shows in the ceviches he produces. Yum. Go here. It's well-crafted, clean food and a nice departure from the regimented feel of your run of the mill sushi bar.",19,0.9913

1804,14,12,5.0,"With a name like the Slight Detour, you just knew this drink was gonna be good. I ordered it the other night at Mayahuel, my new favorite watering hole in NYC. The name promised an attitude adjustment, if only a slight bit, and thankfully the drink -- a trio of jalapeno tequila, reposado tequila and joven mezcal mixed artfully with agave nectar and xocolati mole bitters -- delivered the goods. The smoke of the mezcal combined with the sweetness of the agave and the spiciness of the tequila, and soothed my senses. Soon my hectic week seemed to have order, my stress became a thing of the past. Ahhhh, this was tonic for the soul, indeed. Mayahuel, a relatively new spot in the East Village, pays tribute to tequila and mezcal with drinks like the Slynx, Cabeza Pequeno and Stone Raft. The place also serves Mexican-inspired appetizers and main courses (but other than chips and salsa/guac, I was there to only to drink, admittedly). With its wood walls and funky decor, Mayahuel reminds me of a cantina where I got trashed a few years ago, La Casa De Mezcal in Oaxaca, a province in southern Mexico that's home to the world's best mezcal. There are 3 main seating areas at Mayahuel: in the alcove near the front door; at the small bar where there are also cool banquettes; and upstairs, where there are about 10 tables. I'd shoot for the bar, though you can't go wrong anywhere. Along with the Slight Detour, I recommend a drink called Tequila Gumption, which is mezcal y reposado with maraschino, orange y angostura bitters. It was sort of like a Mexican version of the caipirinha from Brasil. I also highly recommend sampling some of Mayahuel's mezcals straight up. In particular, check out any of the Del Magueys such as San Luis Del Rio, Chichicapa (see my photos for shots of 'mezcaleros' in the remote town of Chichicapa, Oaxaca) or Crema de Mezcal. These are some of the finest mezcals in the world and not often found in NYC. Lastly, don't leave without guzzling down at least one michelada. If you've never tried one, this is a combo of spicy sangrita and cerveza. It comes in a pint glass with a half-filled bottle of Negro Modelo. Granted, this drink resides in its natural habitat on the beach in a place like Zihuatenejo, but still on a hot August night, the Mayahuel michelada comes close to perfection.

Our lineage has a particular penchant for anything fattening and carb-heavy so naturally Amy's Bread fit the bill. Savory, sweet, spicy - put it all on the table for us!!!This is worn territory, but Amy's famous semolina, raisin and fennel bread is the jumpoff.

I would watch it from the park and from my window at night as I went to sleep. It was almost preordained that children would play in such a manner as to interrupt one's sleep in this park. The park flanks General William Jenkins Worth Square, which contains a monument that sits atop the General's body. He was a popular general and also got Worth Street, and Fort Worth, Texas named after him. However, in a Political slap in the face after his death, some politicians who weren't fans of the General decided that he should be laid to rest in a busy and noisy traffic circle, lest he not get much rest. And as children, we felt honored to continue in the tradition of chaos and to wake anyone who dared sleep in the park up! Now a beautiful park and community space, the park is home to some amazing sites, including, the Shake Shack!

First, I just want to point out that I like the name. Ok. Moving along.The mixed drinks and wine selection are fantastic. I'm generally not a fan of mixed drinks (see my review of Little Branch, which is the only other place I'll consume them), but these are works of art in a glass. Special mention: a fellow yelper had an Article 57, which included citrus-infused Luksusowa vodka and fresh ginger juice; he let me try it, and dayummmm...The food isn't an afterthought, but carefully crafted. The menu is small (and the plates are small), but it offers something for everyone. I loved the goat cheese ricotta crostini with espelette pepper. The marinated olives -- a good-sized bowl of 'em for only $4 -- were delicious.The staff were lovely. When I first entered, I thought the server was a friend-of-a-friend who I had yet to meet, as she was chatting so comfortably and sweetly with the guests in my group. More props to her and the rest of the staff because of the following story... It seems a young mother cat had recently decided to call the back garden home.

1811,30,26,5.0,"J and I have a pretty extensive home bar, with over 40 bottles of liquor and 12 different varieties of bitters. It's nice to have options, you know? We have a vintage 1950s hand-crank ice crusher mounted to the wall, and special molds for making giant spherical ice cubes (ice spheres?) that fit perfectly in an Old Fashioned glass. While we're more than competent when it comes to mixing (and even creating) classic cocktails like the Manhattan, the Martinez, and the Mint Julep, there are admittedly some glaring gaps in our repertoire. Like eggs. How on earth do egg drinks come out so foamy?To remedy this, I bought us spots in Astor Center's class ""PDT Presents: Intermediate Home Bartending"" for J's birthday (I feel that the best kind of birthday present to give is one that you also give to yourself, no?). Hosted by two barkeeps from the infamous hot dog/phone booth speakeasy, the class promised to bring our skills to the next level, with lessons on making our own infusions, swizzling, playing with fire, and working with the ever elusive egg.When I walked into the classroom, my jaw just dropped. Jessica F does a great job of describing the space in detail, so I won't, but let it just be said that this has got to be the most well-thought out and perfectly designed high-tech functional space I've ever been in. I'll add that there's a light box built into each station, which I assume is for wine classes. For our class, we each had a complete bar set--Boston shaker, strainer, spoon, muddler, and jigger. The class itself was excellent. They started off on the right foot by immediately making a large batch of punch, which we sipped while they demonstrated how to make our own ginger beer. Next up, we got to try our hand at juleps--I made a variation on the classic, using maple syrup and apple brandy...YUM. We were then treated to a spectacular pyrotechnics demonstration--a flaming hot toddy, which was poured back and forth between two silver mugs, creating a long stream of blue flame! It probably goes without saying that we did not get to try this ourselves.  Finally, it was egg time! The assistants came around and placed an egg in front of each of us, and I was instantly reminded of high school health class when we had to carry an egg around all day to learn what it would be like to be a teenage parent. Except this egg was meant to be broken! First, our teachers made what is one of the most complicated cocktails possible, the Ramos Gin Fizz, and we watched in awe as they created a stiff tower of foam that extended several inches above the rim of the glass. We made the slightly simpler Pisco Sour and New York Flip, both of which were creamy and delicious. Here is the key to egg drinks:1. Add all ingredients to the shaker. Before adding ice, shake the shit out of it. This is called a ""dry shake"".2. Add a ton of ice, and then shake vigorously for as long as you can physically bear it. Literally.Throughout the class we were given lots of interesting historical facts and useful tips, perhaps the most entertaining of which was this letter written in the 1930s regarding the Mint Julep: civilwarhome.com/mintjul…You won't regret reading the entire thing, I promise.By the end of class we felt full of knowledge, and also full of booze. However, we had plans to meet up with two of our favorite cocktail connoisseurs for more drinks. I leaned over to J and whispered, ""We're in trouble"".",30,0.9967
1812,17,17,5.0,"If the infamous halal food cart, ever dies, atones for its sins (such as the use of processed gyro meat, and putting mayo in their yogurt sauce), then goes to heaven and and is reincarnated as a hole in the wall restaurant with actual real, authentic, delicious food, it would become Lahore.Let me paint the picture for you. I went downtown to the Housing Works Bookstore Cafe for an amazing concert (Thanks Lisa Q for encouraging us to go!!) I decided to go early to check out the bookstore and to make sure I got tickets. When I found the place closed early for the benefit concert, I decided to wander about the neighborhood in search of an experience. Didn't get far. As I was walking away from the bookstore, I almost run into a couple of Pakistani taxi driver types barreling out of a door. I look over to see a modest sign. I spot the words Pakistani fast food. Seems promising. Check yelp. Very divey, but with good, authentic food. Just the kind of experience I was looking for.Enter and find a very deli-ish, divey place, with a refrigerated glass case filled with trays of beautiful food, and a kitchen set-up behind the counter.A friendly face looks up to greet me. I ask for lamb and rice. ""Is it ok with chick peas?"" As it turns out, the answer is an emphatic, ""yes, yes, yes"". I say sure. Get the lamb and chick peas over basmati rice. You will thank me.I also got a vegetable somosa. ehh. I've had much better. Limp, greasy, lacking flavor. This somosa had seen better days.Normally I would give a place like this 4-stars. A good effort with good food that a foodie can truly appreciate, if a bit uneven.Why this place gets my coveted 5-stars, and why you should drop what you're doing, and immediately run to the nearest subway, take it to Prince St, and stop in at Lahore to get some good authentic Pakistani taxi driver fast food:1. The lamb. Oh the lamb. Real lamb. Cooked slowly in a tasty sauce. Lamb. Tender falling off the bone. Lamb. You get to suck it off the bone. Lamb. Real lamb. Oh yumm. Lamb.2. The cool guy behind the counter. He was so friendly, and eager to please. When I asked which of these beautiful trays has the lentils, he replied, ""Oh, I have some back here, just cooked, fresh."" Then he immediately followed up with, ""Do you want some?"" ""No, no, I already have the lamb for today. Next time."" ""Here, I'll give you some,"" as he proceeded to open my container, and with my nod, piles on the lentils into a container already filled over the brim with lamb, chick peas and rice.Then seeing my big, wide smile, he asks if I want a bit of yogurt sauce. ""Yes."" I almost forgot to ask, I think to myself, as he dollops generous amounts into a separate container.3. Yogurt sauce. When asked what was in the yogurt sauce, the reply was ""yogurt."" ""What else?"" ""Yogurt, just yogurt?"" The guys from the food cart could learn a thing a thing or two from this place.4. Always has several varieties of lentils and other veg. options available at any time.Lamb, chick peas, basmati rice $6vegetable somosa $1coke $1extra helping of lentils - FREEextra container with yogurt sauce - FREEfeel like you've died and gone to heaven - pricelessDon't get me wrong. This place is divey. You will not want to eat here. You will take your delicious food outside to eat, even if it is pouring rain. (The scaffolding outside can provide some shelter BTW.) Much of the food is kept in a cool display case and is microwaved back to life. Ask for some extra nucalar radeashun. Make sure he gets it nice and warm. It'll taste better. Also, be sure to pour generous amounts of yogurt over the rice. They complete each other.You will wonder if you should've even walked into this place. At least once, maybe twice. Get over the deli-ish part, and you get to experience delish.I took my food over to the steps of the bookstore cafe, and experienced deliciousness as I awaited what tuned out to be an amazing concert, to complete the experience.Get off the food cart line. I know you can do it. Get a friend to talk you through it. I believe in you. Then take the NRW to Prince.

1814,16,12,5.0,"Steak Gluttony... Excessive Eating... Must be dinner at Peter Luger's!Expect nothing of a high end style dinner at Peter Luger's! The restaurant embodies the principles of an Old School Steak House that prides (more like egotistically prides) itself on its Steak and other notable offerings. For those whom are accustomed to world class service, extraordinary décor, and lush flavors, you're in for a true disappointment.We arrived at Luger's for an 8:45pm reservation. My group consisted of 7 individuals. After the host telling us it'll be a slight wait, we proceeded to the bar for a few cocktails.9:15pm rolls along and our table is ready.The service: Waiters have been known to be obnoxious at times. Our waiter had similar properties but because he knew we were locals / regulars, didn't bother giving us a hard time. When first arriving at our table, we were greeted with the words ""what do you want?"". Our party of 7 simply glared at him and told him exactly EVERYTHING we wanted (including dessert, 3 pitchers of water and constant beer refills). He simply smirked and proceeded to place our orders.The Food:Shrimp Cocktail: A basic application of a Shrimp Cocktail served with a side of Cocktail Sauce. There was nothing memorable about this application other than the simplistic but welcoming contrast between the sweetness of the Shrimp and the mild acidity from the cocktail sauce. One thing worth mentioning is the size of the shrimp, they're simply enormous! The # to pound measurement was comparable to that of 5 or 6. The shrimp were huge, not to mention succulent.Bacon: Slightly salty but welcoming! The abundance of fat and size of the bacon made the application similar to that of Christmas Ham. With each bite, the mild brashness of salt is then eased by the abundance of fat that's balanced by the semi-coarse texture from the lean parts of the Bacon. Patrons will find that the sheer size of the Bacon to be enough to entice any palate. Our party opted to order a second serving of Bacon for everyone on the table.Steak for Two: The Porterhouse provides for an even distribution of the marbling within the T-bone steak that allows for a balanced taste between protein and fat. The delicate and bold taste of this steak is generated through its aging process. Steaks are hand selected and are then aged for a period of approximately 28 days to allow for the marbling deposits to flavor the meat. Upon preparation, steaks are cut according to party size and are then cooked in a 1,200 degree boiler (4 seconds for Med Rare for a Steak for Two); this gives the steak the nice charred shell on the outside, while providing tenebrous juices within each cut. The entire process is conducted with no seasoning, thus giving the steak its genuine taste. At first consumption, patrons will find that the natural meaty flavor of the Steak is allowed to shine in the application. The medium-rare cooking temperature of the steak is similar to that of a rare cooking temperature at any other restaurant. When consuming Luger's offerings, patrons will find that the slightly salty and charred exterior works remarkable well to balance out the meatiness and undercooked internal parts of the meat. Needless to say, the Steak for Two is not to be consumed for the faint at heart. Steak lovers will find that Luger's rendition provides a natural steak flavor that's comparable by few other restaurants out there. Luger's ability to embody the natural taste of steak is one that is right to deserve its highly acclaimed praise.Creamed Spinach: Gluttonous, Heavy, and in many ways Excessive, the Creamed Spinach was just as expected. Consuming the creamed spinach is similar to eating a stick of butter, you simply need to prepare for it. From a consumption standpoint, the Spinach was creamy and has remnants of the mild coarse texture of the spinach. The texture and flavor of the Creamed Spinach is engulfed by the excessive amounts of Butter, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and Garlic used in the preparation.German Potatoes: Picture Home Fries, with more oil! That's Luger's version of German potatoes. The well seasoned and crispy potatoes provide further gluttony to the meal. Nothing beats meat and potatoes for dinner. And Luger's rendition of the German Potatoes is one where extra servings are requested.Cheesecake with Schlag: The Cheesecake was Good, The Schlag was better. Best advise is to get the homemade Schlag by itself. The natural frothy and creaminess of Luger's rendition of Whipped Cream is one to be consumed in it's natural form. Both fluffy and mild sweet, the Schlag itself provides a welcoming ending to an already excessive dinner.Needless to say, Salad and Grilled Chicken awaits patrons for days on end after dinner @ Luger's! The excessive amount of food consumed during this single sitting is one that should NOT be overlooked. Come hungry, leave overly stuffed!",26,0.9983

All other muffins should be jealous of this harmonious balance of flavors and textures, each building upon another in layers that blend together to create a sensation your taste buds will thank you for.

1817,14,6,5.0,"Okay, so I'm not a stalker but I've sorta been stalking this place. The first time I'd walked by, I was drunk and I was completely surprised to find something like this. It seemed like an antique store and even in my inibriated state, I knew I'd come back. The cincher was the Oscar Wilde quote scrolled onto the full glass window looking into Lillie's. Forward a couple of weeks.. I could not go back b/c I wasn't quite sure where I'd seen the place. And a coworker who used to live down the block asked me if I knew anything about this place. I knew exactly what place she was talking about but again, could not figure out where it was. She told me it was on this block and for the last few weeks, I've come by about once a week to peek into their window and check up on their progress.And then TONIGHT!! despite having checked earlier this week and still seeing the ""Opening Soon' sign up, I decided to walk by on my way home from the gym. Imagine my surprise, when I saw people smoking outside and as I approached saw the place completely packed. Now, it's not quite as charming completely crowded. And I'm not going to give everything away but here are some highlights: an antique wood carved bar that undulates the length of the room and antique chairs/furnishings shipped all the way from Belfast.. It's somewhere in between being in a chateau and one of those historic European bar. I almost wish they'd do the ""we only allow as many people in as there are seats"" policy adopted by PDT/Bourgeois Pigs and the likes so those in can fully appreciate the beauty that has been brought together by the owners.So, if you've never ever taken anything away from any of my reviews, listen to this: RUN, don't walk to this new bar.",15,0.9292

I fell in love with my Pad Thai with vegetarian duck...and I thought, well, maybe I was just really drunk and it wasn't that good. But I came back sober, ordered the exact same dish, and loved it just as much. What's so great about it to me is that there's a lot of sauce - so many other Pad Thai's are a bit dry. This is plenty saucy and that goes for the fake duck as well - very moist and tasty.They have house wine by the glass for only $4.50 - score!! I like the bathroom here. It's a unisex, with signs on the door that say ""Women"" and ""Men"". The Women sign has a flower on it and the Men sign has a banana on it. And the sink is really unique. There's a copper pipe with holes in it where the water flows out of and seems like it would be a really soothing setup for a shower. The drawback to this pretty cool design is that if you turn the faucet on a little too much, the water splashes everywhere and you end up looking like you had a little accident in the bathroom.I will be back, Beet.

My first visit I wasn't sure if two would be enough and ended up struggling to finish the second. While arepas are the main show here the sides here are also very good. The guacamole & chips is always a good bet and on my most recent visit I tried the Yoyos.

1826,30,27,5.0,"* This review will achieve levels of nerd-dom that will easily surpass that of my Met and Frick museum reviews.      Against the azure blue sky of a brilliant early summer afternoon I could see the majestic roof line of the Cloisters, signaling to me that my long journey north, to the nether reaches of Manhattan, was nearing its end. As I drew closer I could hear the rousing sermon of Pope Urban II as he rallies the assembled christian princes to Crusade at the Council of Clermont. But the voice faded with every step closer.From it's high perch alongside the river I imagine the Cloisters a lonely sentinel, guarding the passageway south into Manhattan. Protecting us, like fortress abbeys of old, from Viking marauders or Attila the Hun, ""The Scourge of God"". The sound of the M4 bus returns my mind to the present.Entering through a heavy wooden door I expect to be greeted by Abbot Berno, the first Abbot of the mighty monastery at Cluny or perhaps by Saint Remigius, baptizer of Clovis, first king of the franks and father of the Merovingian line of Frankish rulers. But neither the Benedictine monk nor the saint appear, only the museum cashier. As I walk around the first colonnaded cloister I wonder how the abbeys defenses will stand up to the imminent attack of the Moorish leader Al Mansur and his Bedouin army that has been plundering the surrounding countryside and laying to waste it's inhabitants. Will we be safe here? My train of thought is broken by Jayne asking me where the restroom is. I return to 2009.We descend down a staircase, into a chamber of crypts and I catch a glimpse of Alcuin of York penning his work ""Propositions of Alcuin, A Teacher of Emperor Charlemagne, for Sharpening Youths"". I have so many questions to ask of him. My eye catches a glint of summer sun in the stained glass window and when I turn back he's gone. Perhaps my presence was too much a distraction.I enter a room of tapestry and can clearly see Gerbert d'Aurillac, the future Pope Sylvester II speaking in hushed tones to Hugh Capet. Perhaps they are discussing their plans to depose Lothair and install Hugh himself as King of France and effectively end the reign of the Carolingian line of kings. I half expect to see Otto III join them. My point?When Rockefeller imagined the Cloisters it was with the hope that visitors would be transported back to the Europe of the middle ages. That we here in the present day would be able, if only for a brief time, to walk amongst the ghosts of antiquity. To this end the Cloisters is a rousing success.Nerd in the Hizz-ouse!!",25,0.9293
1827,49,22,5.0,"Filipina-American New Yorker. Yes, that's who I am. Take away any of those cultural elements, and your picture of me will be incomplete. No, I wasn't born in New York, but like millions of others, I arrived a young immigrant. And I forged my identity growing up on the streets of New York. Yes, I remember the crime-ridden days, when Times Square was an unsafe place to be at night. Yes, I've been mugged - a total of three times all before the age of 14. And yes, I was allowed to roam the streets during ""out-lunch"" at the ripe age of 12. Not only that, but I was taken to Broadway shows, the ballet and the opera as a child. I learned how to take the subway and bus by myself as I commuted to middle school on the Upper West Side. I had a short stint as a prep school kid and was happy to escape. I went to one of the top public high schools in the country and made the closest friends I have to this day. I've met the most amazing, creative, inspiring, generous, gracious and wonderful people from all walks of life throughout my time here. I honestly can't imagine living anywhere else in the world right now.I sometimes think about how different my life would have been if I had grown up in the Philippines, or even Louisville, KY, where we lived for a brief two years before relocating permanently to NYC. What kind of person would I be? Would I still be a writer? A curious traveler? An avid food enthusiast? I'm not so sure. But something drew my mom to this city, and despite her 6 year-old's tantrums, she picked us up and moved us up north.

1828,23,21,5.0,"Not every flavor is a complete winner, but there are enough winners to keep me coming back again and again. I'll start with the skippables - for an ice cream shop with distinctly Asian flavors on offer, the red bean here is very disappointing. It's sweet with a vague hint of red bean, but rather bland. The corn is interesting but not particularly good. The itty bitty corn bits are a nice touch, but I would actually prefer a stronger corn flavor. The pumpkin is tasty but is missing a little something. Some spice would really help it along. The hazelnut is almost excellent, but it may suffer from too much cream and not enough nut.And now for the winners. I always get a scoop of wasabi when they have it. The wasabi ice cream is bravely made, with the distinct heated flavor of wasabi shining through the cream. It's no mere modified vanilla. The black sesame is divine - rich and mellow but not overly sweet. The mango tastes fresh and pure, with the fruit and cream playing off each other for the perfect note of fruity sweetness. Honeydew sorbet will take you back to childhood summers with Fresh Melon bars. Butter pecan coats your mouth with the decadence of good butter, and the clean refreshing mint chocolate chip may be the best mint chocolate chip I've ever had. The ice cream is consistently good across the board, beautifully textured, thick, smooth, and creamy.As you can see, I've eaten more than my weight in ice cream at this place. The parlor is clean and charming, all white with the ice creams displayed in colorful rows and cakes looking pretty to the left. The service isn't noteworthy in either direction. There's no grumbling over repeated requests for samples, but I haven't gotten many smiles either. The servers also don't seem to get the concept of 3 flavors in 2 scoops or 4 flavors in 3 scoops, etc. This is why I always have to get three scoops. It is also why one time after finishing off my three scoops, I went back to order two more. The ice cream is just so good, and I can never choose just one or two...or sometimes three or four flavors.",23,0.9969

So I called on the expert advice of Becca S--she pointed me to Zenkichi, raving about its sexiness and great food. (and pointing me to her hilarious review..i.e. don't go to Zenkichi with your old pal you just reconnected with on Facebook)The restaurant is a dark, maze-like den for lovers. One narrow hallway among bamboo-curtained tables leads to another...turning, you step from one slate-gray stone to the next and arrive at the next hallway...oh wait--that's a mirror. Turn around. Watch out for that tiny step. It is an absolute thrill to navigate the narrow halls of Zenkichi, catching vague glimpses of parties behind the shades and scattered laughs and chatter.""Excuse meeee---"" That's the sound of your waitress arriving to roll up the bamboo curtain separating you and your date from the rest of the world. The servers are impeccably polite at Zenkichi, almost to the point of embarrassment, in a way that only the Japanese can truly pull off.And the food--it's delightful. Portions are small, as intended, but big on flavor. Creamy kumamoto oysters with jellied bonito broth ease you into the current winter tasting menu, accompanied by delicate spoons of silky homemade tofu topped with urchin and a vinegared, thinly sliced maguro-topped salad.The chicken and mushroom salad is forgettable--but only because it's followed by tempura-style shirako, or cod milt. If you bother looking up what you're eating, it seems wholly unappetizing--but it'd be a big mistake not to try it. It's like a delicately battered and fried mushroom on the outside and a creamy warm oyster on the inside. Don't miss this seasonal treat!The miso grilled cod is predictably wonderful and buttery, and the final hot dish, albacore simmered with daikon, is a surprising treat, a sort of comfort food home-cooked just for you by the Japanese mother you never had.Desserts aren't a strong point at Zenkichi--honestly I'd prefer an interesting tea in lieu of the forced renditions of western favorites (strawberry shortcake?).To drink, it's nice to try the sake tasting, where they serve you three shot-glass-sized portions of different sakes from their well curated menu. The choices on the last visit ranged from a junmai dai ginjo, a delicately floral sake made with the sweetest part of the rice grain and best drunk alone, to a junmai, heavier, slightly acidic and more redolent of ferment--perfect to pair with fish.I don't believe I could ever tire of Zenkichi--leaving, you'll feel as if you just walked out of your personal paradise.

""turo-turo"" means ""point-point"" in Tagalog. you order by pointing to the steam table. everyday is something different... which i LOVE. i can't name everything they serve- but some of my favorites are: Milkfish, Chicken Menudo, Kare Kare and Sinigang. you can also order freshly made items like Lumpiang Shanghai (filipino style spring rolls)- a TOTAL HIT!!!, Pancit Bihon (thin rice noodles w/ your choice of meat), Palabok (thick rice noodles smothered with a thick, golden shrimp sauce and topped with: shrimp, crushed or ground (chicharron), hard-boiled egg) and almost ANY Filipino dish you ask. the moment i walked in. i was a little skeptical. almost petrified. i didn't even like stepping into Chinese take out places in S.I.- but i needed to get over my anxiety. the owner, a quiet and smiling elderly man greeted me and asked what i wanted. it was still mid breakfast hour and not many steam dishes were ready. i was craving for something hot and broth-y. i usually order Sinigang (a sour soup of fish, pork, shrimp, or beef is stewed with tamarind, green pepper, tomato, and onion), but the cat had my tongue. i didn't know what to order. now, he could probably see my body language and knew there was something ""off"" with me. he yelled into the kitchen and asked them make Chicken Mami (chicken noodle w/ clear broth) for me. i was confused- but something in my heart told me to trust him. it was magnificent and just perfect for my taste palette. that's how it all started. i've been coming here for a long time- the owner and his wife smile and welcome me every time i stop in. they may not know me by name nor do we have long conversations. however, i feel like they know my soul. i feel so happy when i'm there and all the great comfort food is available that i miss from living in Manila and the westcoast- with its abundant Filipino community. anyway, on with the menu! the breakfast deals are extraordinary. most people don't like heavy breakfasts... but Filipinos- don't care. this menu consists of: * Daingsilog - fish, garlic fried rice and fried egg * Longsilog - longganisa (filipino sausage), fried rice and fried egg * Tocilog - filipino ham/bacon, garlic fried rice and fried egg * etc. if you ask, they will cook it. =)my personal favorite is the Spamsilog or Longsolig. i top it off with some Jufran banana ketchup. you can also order Lechon Baboy. wtf is that? WELL... if you're a fan of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations- you can recall the episode when he's in the Philippines. yup. the ROAST PIG. you can either order it whole (which will take a few days to pick up) or just ask for cuts of it at the restaurant. also in that episode... the sizzling Sisig, a Philippine dish made from parts of pig's head, liver and usually seasoned with kalamansi and chili peppers. sounds scary, right? it's actually pretty good! Island's Grand Grill will whip this up for you, too! During the spring/summer- they offer Halo Halo, a dessert that is a mixture of shaved ice and milk to which are added various sweet beans and fruits. it's a must try! Turrón (plantain/banana spring roll) is fried up and on display for you to drool over daily. Leche Flan and other baked goods such as Sio Pao (like Chinese buns) and Pan de Sal (sweet rolls) are available to purchase. i hope this place never goes away. ever since i've developed a love for this restaurant, i feel like it's a part of my family. i bring my friends who will brave it out to visit me in Shaolin (SI). they fall in love with the owners and enjoy the delicious food, too. i know practically everything on their menu and in total awe every time they randomly freestyle something for me if i have a craving. in all honesty- on the outer shell, i am a Korean. in heart; a true Filipina. =)",36,0.9991
1833,15,17,5.0,"***250th Review!***There are days in our life that seem like any other day, but they are borne of events that end up making them extraordinary. On Saturday I spent the entire day in Brooklyn and was exposed to every great thing about that borough. I never appreciated all that I was missing until that day. But one thing clearly stood out, Grimaldi's Pizza. I am almost embarrassed to say it. I mean, if I see a line of tourists, I immediately look for another place to go. I am not even all that crazy about pizza -- I usually don't even eat the crust. Everything about this place just seems wrong for me. As a couple we would never make it. My friends would whisper in my ear, telling me that this Grimaldi girl is bad news. But I have to throw away everything I think I know about food, or at least pizza, because this is the best damn pizza I ever had in my life! How do I know? I ATE THE ENTIRE PIZZA BY MYSELF!!!Yes, you read that correctly. I am a fairly thin guy who is never yielded to gluttony. And somehow, miraculously, I summoned a ravenous appetite that could not be assuaged. On my pizza, I had the pepperoni and the garlic. Sweet, spicy, delicious pepperoni. Rustically cut, thick, and robust in flavor. I slavered for this. But then there was the garlic.  I do not recall ever seeing garlic as an option for a pizza, but it was a brilliant stroke. Warm roasted fresh garlic made this pizza sing, ""That's Amore""! The marriage of such hedonistic tastes was further enhanced by the gentle call of that decadent marinara. Like a siren leading me not into ruin, but into unabated temptation. I was more than pleased. Everything was just right about this pizza. Even the crust. The crust! So light and puffy. As I was just savoring this experience, they played ""New York, New York"" in the restaurant. Indeed, I was just having one of those incredible New York days.Now I am in a terrible predicament. I have found the best pizza in the world, but it will only see me in Brooklyn, and even then only after I wait an hour in line. Like glimpsing David for the first time, you are awestruck, but you can never have it to yourself. You must suffer for the great things in life. So, only in an effort to make the lines a little bit smaller. Stay away from this place. The pizza is terrible here. Leave me alone to eat all of it by myself!",17,0.9901

The wait could be long, so the other option is to go to Jaya which is also good and has a cool atmosphere, except they don't serve my favorite dish which I will mention below.I like to do ""Family style"" at any Asian restaurant I go to, because there are so many different flavors to each dish, it's good to share. Like everyone else, you have to order the Roti Canai which is a thin, papery, crispy pancake that you dip into a curry chicken sauce. You should also order the Roti Telur which is a thicker pancake stuffed with egg and onions that you can dip into the curry chicken sauce as well. I also like the steamed spring roll with the jicama and shrimp, it's very similar to a Vietnamese fresh summer roll.Best dish that no one seems to write about: SARANG BURONG - it is a mix of shrimp, chicken, snow peas and other veggies sauteed and put inside of a fried Taro basket. This dish is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The fried Taro basket can take the place of coconut rice because of it's subtle sweet flavoring to offset the saltiness in the dish itself. I mean, I dream about this dish, it is THAT GOOD. I haven't been able to find another Malaysian place that makes this - except 1 place in Malaysia. I don't know if it is authentic persay, but I all I know is that it is DAMN GOOD.The tumeric rice dish as a side is good too, it is coconut rice with shrimp, eggs, and chinese sausage. The Hainese chicken dish is also very very good. You will spend about $20 each on a good, filling, authentic dinner.",21,0.9665

1840,20,19,5.0,"One of my good friends was visiting NY for the first time, so I took her for a little candlelit dinner on Mulberry Street. I'm extra-romantical like that. Boys could learn from me. Though a few guys have it down---- those at Buona Notte, for instance.   We strolled along Little Italy's main stretch - hearing the 20-second blurbology of each menu, some delivered with such charm that would make any girl blush. Points for Little Italy, because charming old men are just adorable. Little old ones who offer you free sangria? Those are my favorite!!!  Forgetting the menu at the mere mention of free sangria, we skipped inside. Immediately we were presented with a basket of fresh bread, and two gargantuan glasses of pure sweet bliss.  We shared an appetizer and entree, meanwhile hoping that the restaurant wouldn't be all grrrr about us skimping on food as we happily sipped our sangria. However, just the opposite happened. The waiters were just smitten with us, and let us stretch our meal over the course of a couple hours. We ordered a second glass of sangria (did I mention that this is liquid ecstasy? Cause it is.), and had the perfect catching-up date.  Little did we know, good looking waiters are actually practicing to one day become charming little old men. The service was excellent - every appearance was made with a dash of good conversation, charisma, and a little thing I like to call italianhottness. Our waiter brought dessert on the house .... and by dessert, I mean Kahlua.  All of our drinks were eliminating the need to move on to a bar, so we continued camping out and enjoying ours perfect evening in ""Italy."" When we thought we had better move on, the waiter asked us to stay if we were content, and casually refilled our Kahlua glasses.  I love that my little hour long dinner plans melted into a good three hours, at least. Every second of it was perfection, making this one of my most memorable dining experiences in New York. Cute old men, stop trying to entice me to dine at your restaurant tonight. I know where my spot is.",21,0.9982
1841,8,5,5.0,"The pressure! I feel like my sacred and epic dining experience at Momofuku Ko, the one we waited two months of mouse clicking to get, should be honored with an equally impressive, sleek and innovative review. Alas, I might have to forgo ""FUNNY"" and ""COOL"" and just stay hardcore focused on the ""USEFUL"" component of my Yelp. Since photos are not allowed, we took copious notes at the beech wood bar. We listened closely to the chefs and asked pointed questions to write down every outrageous ingredient from the sweet potato vinegar to the peanut brittle. If you're wondering what your experience at Momofuku Ko (translated: lucky peach girl...lol...maybe not exactly like that but that's the sense I've made of it), might be like, here is a list of every single thing served at this New York culinary innovation.But first, a word on the atmosphere. The place is kind of like a charismatic, skinny jean wearing rock star guy who nonchalantly wows you with his guitar solo skills. He exudes the: ""I seem laid back but actually I've got to contain myself because I know I'm really fucking cool"" vibe. As we all know, everyone has a mad crush on the smooth talented rock star; you want to be near him and when you actually get to be around him (cause it's a privilege), you feel a little excited and on edge. The waitresses are young and laid back, loud rock/hip hop music plays and the chefs just look too cool for school as they shave the foie gras and deep fry the short ribs. I also think that the bar stool seats speak volumes. It's like... don't get too comfortable because comfort is not what this is all about here at Ko. It's about crazy ass creativity, engage in your eating experience, sit up and take notice while you indulge in this Top Chef -esque (I relate everything to reality TV) experience. Yeah, they're right. I felt pretty lucky. They've got it all figured out and this was a dining experience I'll probably never forget. The combinations were out of control out of the box and every adventurous foodie would love indulging in nine courses PLUS the amuse bouche, mofo-k'ers. Okay, so here's what we ate based on my co-eater's notes and reproduced with her permission: Amuse Bouche and Assorted Appetizers: Biscuit with black pepper butter with a hint of crunchy sugar topping (served on a slivered piece of slate). COMMENT: A little TOO salty and the muffin was ridiculously dense. Nothing reallly out of this world. Fried fresh pork skin (chicharrone) with spicy saltCOMMENT: Just fine.Tender giant squid with julienne mint, freeze dried Chinese sausage and shaved lily bulb.COMMENT: Okay. Very tender for squid.FIRST COURSE: Fresh Long Island fluke in sweetened buttermilk yuzu sauce with poppy and chivesCOMMENT: I really liked this and it looked so PRETTY!SECOND COURSE: Fresh Santa Barbara uni shiso vegetable broth with mustard greens, snow peas and cucumberCOMMENT: I've never eaten anything like this in my life. It was just like a bowl full of summer with some squishy pink sea urchin basking in shiso gloryTHIRD COURSE: Lightly smoked soft yoked egg with fried fingerling potato chips, sous vide white onions with sweet potato vinegar. OH! And there was CAVIAR! How did I forget to write this the first time? COMMENT: TO DIE FOR! I loved this because all the flavors just went together and it was satisfying and divine.FOURTH COURSE: Fresh uba and pickled ramps served with a pan-seared diver scallop and broccoli rabe florets, glazed morels and air-puffed brown rice. COMMENT:  The scallops were perfect and it's fun to try to get a little bit of every ingredient in one bite.FIFTH COURSE: Fresh pan roasted South Carolina soft shell crab in an ""Old Bay Butter sauce"" with shaved celery and thinly sliced hearts of palm.COMMENT: The sauce was great. Celery? Maybe not necessary.SIXTH COURSE: Lychee and an alcohol infused Riesling gelee with peanut brittle topped with shaved foie gras.COMMENT: This was crazy insane strange. I'm glad I tried it but I'm not sure if I'd ever do it again....SEVENTH COURSE: Deep fried short rib with assorted seasonal onions such as grilled ramps, green onion puree with chive oil (inch thick short rib were sous vided for 48 hours at 59 degrees then frozen before deep frying.COMMENT: RAVE REVIEWS!EIGHTH COURSE: Guava sorbet with a cream cheese skin. It looked like a weird egg out of ""Clockwork Orange"" or something. NINTH COURSE: Black sesame seed ice cream, coconut cream sauce and lemon custard served with a slice of funnel cake. Okay- so that's really really comprehensive and I hope it helps you or at least gets your creative juices flowing.

1842,16,14,5.0,"""I LOVE Levain!"" I shot up in an instant. The president of our company looked up at me in wonder. ""Did you suggest that to us?""""Erm...no...but I wish I had!"" I added, still smiling in excitement. I then sat down, and the meeting continued. My co-worker in Marketing explained that it had actually been their idea to gift our advertisers with treats from Levain. As he spoke, the president looked up Levain's site and flashed an image of one of the bakery's humongous cookies on the conference screens, leaving it there for the rest of the meeting.This was last Thursday when the secret of Levain got out to my company. Of course, I've tried to spread it numerous times before. I've known about Levain for almost a year now. Ever since, I've found myself dejected countless times at the blank stares after my mention of Levain. ""Oh, you've never heard of it?"" ""That's OK."" ""You should really try it sometime."" Those are my calm automated responses, which flow out instantly to cover up my real reactions of ""How. Do you NOT. Know This. Yet?!"" ""Who deprived you, my child?!!!!"" ""WHHyyyy ..y""I cannot be pretentious, though. It wasn't my own discovery to begin with. When you date a dessert connoisseur, you find out many things you did not know before. So I can't take credit for it, but I do give credit where it's due, and I can only say this: Levain serves up the best cookies I have ever tasted. Take it from any angle:1. Originality: I've never seen a bigger cookie than this monster of about an inch of thickness. 2. Texture: Its warmth and moistness allow the flavors to meld together into one harmonious splash of sweetness. 3. Taste: From chocolate chip walnut to dark chocolate peanut butter chip, Levain cookies will satisfy a craving no matter which flavor you pick. 4. And finally, simplicity: Levain doesn't boast any outlandish combinations nor does it offer any unique ingeredients. That's the magic of the tiny unpretentious basement bakery: With only four cookies on the menu, made with the most common ingredients, Levain constantly wins publicity, from renowned food blogs to yearly food lists. Sure each cookie may contribute about 1,000 calories to your tummy and hips, but who ever said that one won't keep you full for about two meals' worth of your day? If you haven't visited Levain yet, go. It deconstructs everything you ever thought you knew about a cookie and alters even the most dignified composure. Even as I napped later that day after my first trip to Levain, I woke up to find the cookies we had taken home gone. Though he frowned and shrugged in seeming cluelessness, dessert connoisseur still had crumbs on his fingers. To this day, when I think of Levain, I smile: I smell not only chocolate and peanut butter, but a good dose of culprit as well.",17,0.9946

The service was great - they even accommodated my request to order a dish from the Prix Fixe menu as an a la carte dish - the Rouget with Iranian Saffron Risotto. Then came the Halibut which was almost overwhelming rich, but oh-so tender and perfectly cooked. My Famous Foodie Friend (you astute Yelpers will be able to guess who) had the Eggplant Terrine (I'm definitely getting this if I ever go back) and a chef's specialty vegetarian entree (not as impressive). Their famous breads were also good - they have more than a handful of choices, so you can keep going back for more! The saffron-walnut bread was particularly delicious, as others have noted.Deserts were chocolate-y and delicious. A chocolate soaked brioche for me (see pictures) and chocolate souffle for the FFF. An interesting combination as they were similar in appearance but subtly different in texture and flavor. Oh and the restaurant itself is beautiful - the red room casts a beautiful dim light over everything - it's the perfect backdrop to an excellent meal. The apples and the lemon saffron loaf on the way out were just the icing on the beautiful Bouley cake. I saw couples young and old, friends, and families all sharing the delicious food here and enjoying themselves tremendously.

1846,19,20,5.0,"There are certain things that once you spend years getting it for free it's real hard to pay for later in life; for me those things are haircuts and movie tickets. In my younger years I pimped my hair out for $20 an hour to Aveda at hair shows around Southern California, but then I moved away to college and never got another hair cut again. Three years ago I finished my masters degree and finally had to get a real job. I bought a white button down shirt (still never been worn) a suit (ok, just the jacket) a Tiffany necklace (on my Mom's credit card) and a (overpriced) Pina Zangaro portfolio and quickly landed a position.

She directed me to Commune with the words ""I close my eyes as she cuts my hair and pray that when they open I will look half Japanese"" this alluring description began my 2 year patronage of stylist Nobu who with little instruction gave me brilliantly choppy layered locks and tiny seasonal bangs. But then Nobu moved back to Japan and I was at a lost - 8 months later with a head of horrid split ends I called Commune to save me again.My instructions were simple, cut off as much as you want, make it super choppy and please get as much body into my bone straight fine hair as possible.

Accessible by the 6 and the 2/3 trains and easily identifiable from the street, I waltz right into Bikram Yoga East Harlen and after a short ring on the buzzer I'm up the stairs and greeted by a warm lady behind a desk in an inviting marigold room.

It sounds kinky, but alas, it merely means I get a sweet intro package - one week of class, with towel rental, lock rental, and mat rental, since I have none of the necessary yoga gear.

I go to the urinal and continue to look around while I handle the business. The light is streaming through the window, and oh my, what a lovely sink fixture! I feel relaxed in this Zen-like bathroom. The pee flows freely. I exit the locker room and lobby, go up the stairs and find a calm resting area. I take a seat in a wicker foldout chair and feel the heat emanating from the adjacent studio. I recall that Oriana J. told me to ""wear as little as humanly possible"" when I asked her about this Bikram yoga schtuff. I scoffed at the time, assuming she just wanted me to dress like a hussy for her viewing pleasure, but once I enter the studio and get hit by the heat, I realize it has nothing to do with that.We get down to the nitty gritty.110 degrees (I later find out it's often hotter than this). 15% humidity (I later see in the thermostat that it's closer to 20%). 90 minutes (I later find out that it was, in fact, 90 minutes). 26 poses (I later find out that that's roughly 26 more than I'm ready to handle).The instructor makes class easy to follow and is also incredibly encouraging. She doesn't stop class to point and laugh when I'm struggling. She takes the time to offer quick personal notes to the other people in the class, keeping us all focused and on point with our postures. She also knows that I know my body better than she does, telling me it's okay to sit a few poses out my first time. Survival (staying in the room) is the first baby step in Bikram.

It's taxing in a way that's completely different from when you hit the gym and lift weights (like I used to during my short-lived I.WANNA.GET.JACKED. phase). After what feels like forever, it's over, and I lay in the room to rest before collecting myself and walking out. Walking out feels so bloody good. Shit's downright refreshing.Also refreshing? Bottles of apple cider for our special birthday celebration.

I got there at 7 and you best believe I had every single beer they offered on tap by 8. They were all delicious, particularly the ""Sweet Action."" The beer from the cask was a little warm--- it was all good though, went down smooth like mother's milk. Magically, I bumped into a former colleague dressed head to toe in formal wear (macho, macho). Naturally, I suggested we crack some crabs--- only 2 dollars each!! We had to sit at a special communal table covered with the day's NYtimes (handy). He smashed crab all over himself (better take off your Rolex, champ) and I laughed and laughed while gingerly pulling sweet flesh out from my expertly hand opened shells. ""That's what ties are for. They were invented so that your coat wouldn't dirty your shirt.... Unfortunately now they're more expensive than shirts..."" his voice trailed off as he looked at his crab juiced Italian silk (heeheehee). We played a drinking game since we only had an hour for half-priced beer. For each crab we ate we had to chug one beer (my idea). Old Bay Seasoning is a good rim for carbonated wheat... a great thing to take the edge off something too hoppy I'd say. The crabs were smothered in it, so sensational. The GM and servers watched our game slightly amused--- mostly they were impressed we knew how to eat crab.  After washing our hands thoroughly, we sat down for dinner. My colleague almost got whiplash when he saw the burger with all the fixings come out of the kitchen and he ordered one immediately. It was so beautiful, I'd eaten it many times in the past (pure, fresh beef joy) and declined a bite. It looked juicy, in fact, so juicy it dripped all over his expensive navy sleeves (tisk, tisk--- hahaha, why am I evil?). I ordered the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. It was a roasted vegetable dish on top of wheat. Each little root vegetable was too precious--- their skin was so sweet from being lovingly roasted. The little cippolinis melted away like French caramels. Mmmmm, dirt candy. We ordered two desserts! The stout float and the doughnuts. Hahaha, for every doughnut we ate we had to chug one glass of beer (my idea, again). The doughnuts were perfect. Cakelike and yet refreshing with its lemon verbanay glaze. Such a smart, satisfying dessert. The stout float I wasn't liking so much-- good vanilla ice cream though. The strawberries were a little too syrupy. What am I talking about? I was just too full to put it in my mouth. It was bitter, tangy, creamy--- dreamy. My lightweight colleague hailed a cab (pussy) but I walked happily back home with my food baby in tow. FTW!!!!

So what about special kind of nomenclatures that mix the best of both worlds in order to produce a rapturous shudder in my hypothalamus? I want to speak about one such lady, she was a Hapa. Half Korean - Half American, to be exact. A mixture that I will never forget, and that I will keep revisiting time and time again. The Korean aesthetics were there; that attention to clean detail and modern lines, interspersed with the American necessity of hodge-podge; a wall cobbled together with various New York pictures, contrasted the green/white lounging area towards the back. Small cushioned stools, low and minimal, the Korean sensitivity prevailing in the overall décor. On the wall, painted black cages meant for one thing only: to trap aesthetic junkies like me into an endless repetition of this dangerous interracial spawn: Hot-dog + Korean food.*Drools*I devoured my delicious Hot Dog showered with Dak-Galbi bbq with no consideration whatsoever to matters of weight; this was not junk food as far as I was concerned, the moment when the American classic mixed with the Korean classic, a new taste was born, meant to make you forget about the street quality of the meal by adding a touch of home and flavor to an erstwhile depressing and vulgar option. My Bulgogi hot dog was even tastier, and as I eat this Hapa with ravenous intent, I couldn't help but remember the words of Jane, who had told me at the counter: ""Kimchi and Veggie Hot Dogs are coming soon, be sure to come back you hear?""I will Jane, I so will.",20,0.9109

Forget Pinkberry, they have a horrible aftertaste and you *know* I'm right about that. Flurt is where it's at. I was supposed to go out with the girls this past Saturday night. I got dressed up for the occasion. My sister (if she's reading this) knows this means I traded my college t-shirt and winter Uggs* for cute high heels and a dress. I may have even curled my hair.The problem? I practically fell asleep in said clothes before making it out. So I decided to change into my sweats, a ponytail, eye cream, and my glasses (or as I call it: sexy) and call it a night. Just as I was about to curl up into my bed, my roommates tempted me with the only thing that could get me out of that fantastic and delirious state of mind: frozen yogurt.""16 Handles? Please? Let's go! Let's take a cab."" I begged.""We are Flurt girls,"" they responded, almost in unison.I was a little hesitant because 16 Handles is my favorite place in the world currently. I even talk about it at bars when there's a conversation lull, that's how much I love 16 Handles. But I'm in this happy and great place right now in life where I'm open to trying almost anything** new. And since Flurt is extremely close to the new apartment, Flurt it was. So we walk in and it's super minimal. Nothing on the walls. At all. Only one flavor: original. And they take debit cards. The girls explain the process to me: you order a medium and you get three toppings. Simple. We decide to go half healthy and half junk food - strawberries, oreos, and chocolate chips.Can I just tell you how generous they are with their toppings? You know how when you're eating ice cream or frozen yogurt and you get to the middle/bottom and there are no more toppings left? All the fun was at the top and now you feel a little sad because it's gone? Toppings in every bite at Flurt. They PILE ON the toppings. And the best part was actually the fruit. I think it's because this froyo does, in fact, taste a bit more yogurty than ice creamy and therefore it goes better with fruit. Next time I might even forgo the junk and stick to the fruit. I think they even have wheatgrass shots here but I really don't understand that. I don't really believe in the benefits of wheatgrass. I'm a wheatgrass skeptic.But Flurt frozen yogurt has made me a believer and totally made my Saturday night bonding over healthy dessert.

1859,19,12,5.0,"I've never had ramen not out of a package before so when people started telling me about this place, I couldn't quite fathom why people would pay so much for ramen.I associate the food with college kid budgets and sodium induced highs. However after last night's visit, my life is changed.They probably shouldn't call it ramen because it doesn't really deserve the negative connotation. The wait can be brutal but that's understandable.The ambiance is beautiful.There is a small bar as soon as you walk in with a wall full of unique ramen bowls (must be a bitch to dust and keep clean!)The hostess is adorable. To keep her waitees straight, she draws little pictures of what each person is wearing. My friend and I were known as green coat and black coat (full-on trench/peacoat pictures in effect).The restaurant is a lot larger than I thought. There are beautiful private booths (probably would be great for big dinner parties) and long wooden tables made for family-style eating. There are stark white walls with pop out Japanese characters and an open kitchen so you can witness all their noodle-making chaos.Don't expect a terribly expansive menu- they're really known for their broth ramens.There are five different kinds. Classic, Modern, a Spicy Classic, Miso, and Soy. I was told the Modern was the most savory so I decided to go for that. I opted to add in a flavored hard-boiled egg. It was everything I expected it to be. The broth was so incredibly flavorful- it was a blend of creamy pork flavors infused with a wonderful garlic aroma (don't worry, the garlic is subtle so you can still kiss your heart out later on, ha ;) )The noodles are al dente and fresh. They are a little reminiscent of somen noodles but without the mushiness. There are three pieces of tender pork meat, cooked so well that the fat was nothing but an explosion of juiciness that dissolves automatically on the tongue (and I despite fat!). Might be worth it to spring for an extra side order of it.The broth, in all its deliciousness was ultimately too salty for me to finish but is really worth every single slurp.I definitely woke up this morning with an intense craving that is foreign to my carb-conscious self.",23,0.9949

[IF THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE, GO TO (C).]4) Nothing like having four desserts to celebrate your birthday. [IF THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE, GO TO (D).]or, my personal favorite...5) My belt popped during my meal. Literally. [IF THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE, GO TO (E).]* ~ * ~ *A) Imagine a potato chip...but erase the -otato and add -ear. Paper thin and concentrated in flavor, this deceptively simple element of my amazing star anise roasted pear dessert was probably the highlight of that course.B) With the exception of the sourdough varieties (although I'm from San Francisco, I dislike sourdough -- I know, this is sacrilege!), I had, in chronological order, the olive roll, the sweet butter roll, the roasted nut slice, the raisin and walnut slice, the mini French baguette, and the garlic focaccia. In case you couldn't tell, that is a lot of bread. Add to that the fact that they even REPLACED my butter dish (with a brand new pat of butter)...and you get the picture. Although they were all good in their own way, I have two comments: (1) I was not a fan of the dry dusting of something-or-other on the garlic focaccia, and (2) the sweet butter roll was divine. It was, essentially, the epitome of what bread should be.C) And if that doesn't tip you off, then the fact that it takes three servers to serve you your one dish should.D) Imagine my surprise when, upon receiving my roasted pear dessert, a molten chocolate cake dish, plate of petit fours, and basket of freshly baked madelines also materialized...voila!E) In my defense, my belt was a patent leather wrap belt that very easily slides one way to the other in the style of the following: img4.realsimple.com/imag…. Still, it was more than worth the three-and-a-half pounds I gained in one evening. I had never understood the term ""food coma"" until that night.

And my best in New York...(so far).The service was hospitable and welcoming. On a side note, I was surprised to discover that, contrary to what one may expect, it is NOT a requirement to speak French to work here. Even so, conversation with the servers can be un petit probleme...because their probably-French accents make everything -- even garlic bread -- sound exotic. I used Open Table to reserve, but called up the restaurant to change numbers. They did not bat an eyelash when I changed my reservations down to one person. Yes, I went to Daniel alone. Yes, I had an amazing time. People really need to stop freaking out about how ""brave"" you have to be to eat out alone. Are you comfortable with yourself? Do you not like your own company? I think these questions go to a deeper problem than just a simple solo meal can address.However, I digress. The food was wonderful, and even with ""just"" the three course prix fixe, I was still full 36 hours later. Yup. Pretty crazy.The cast (in order of appearance):Amuse bouche of a trio of beets-inspired dishes.Appetizer of paprika-crusted Maine lobster tail with roast broccolini and this punchy spiced pine nuts sauce.(Surprise guest appearance by) Chef's complimentary dish of ravioli in a sweet-ish brown sauce.Main course of duck two-ways (breast and a dark meat egg-roll-type thing). The duck was succulent, and the skin was delicious, but I didn't like the citrus (grapefruit?) used on top....could have done better with Mandarin orange in my opinion.Dessert of star anise roasted pear on gingerbread with a scoop of toasted pecan ice cream.(Second surprise guest appearance by) Chef's complimentary dessert of a molten lava chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.Petit fours...and freshly baked madelines........with a consistent cast of extras in the form of the olive roll, the sweet butter roll, the roasted nut slice, the raisin and walnut slice, the mini French baguette, and the garlic focaccia.Is it any surprise my belt popped?110% worth eating Ramen and Cup O'Noodles for a week in order to drop the $165 (which, I note, is surprisingly affordable....for (i) no alcohol, (ii) an order of bottled water, (iii) tea with dessert, and (iv) a 25%+ tip) to experience this masterpiece.",27,0.9971

When I took a bite I didn't know that it would taste that good. The chicken wasn't chewy and the mushrooms were fresh, but I think what really did it was the swiss cheese. The swiss cheese really worked well with the chicken and especially with the fresh mushrooms, although I really didn't taste any pesto which she probably forgot...but it was still delicious.Sweet or savory either one is good. Luckily my boyfriend had a sweet tooth so he ordered a sweet crepe; ""The Famous Crepe"". The famous crepe consisted of FRESH strawberries, bananas, nutella inside and topped with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. GOOD LORD WAS IT GOOD! What really put it over the top was the fresh strawberries. It was really really fresh, like they have strawberries growing in the back of their store or something.I've read a lot of reviews about crepes and some people complain about the crepes being too thick, but creperie crepes were just perfect. It was not thick at all so it doesn't overwhelm the stuff inside, but it also wasn't too thin that you couldn't taste the crepe at all.

Access will be limited during peak hours.Today (June 8th) was the press preview day, and I got to see a sneak peak sans big crowds. The website photos of the new Highline Park do not do it justice. The 8 or so blocks of completed park combine traces of the historic 1930s ironwork railings and sections of vintage railroad tracks with sleek modern design, including neon-lit underpasses beneath hulking concrete buildings and horizontal buttresses that seem to dissolve into gravel. My favorite section of the park has cleverly designed wooden lounge chairs. Some are permanent fixtures, big enough for a large group of friends to sprawl out -- others are individual chairs set on wheels that roll along one of the preserved sections of railroad track. Highline visitors can pull themselves away to some privacy, or roll up next to another chaise for more intimate conversation. Very smart!There's a sleekly designed ampitheatre with a picture window overlooking an intersection in the meatpacking district. Even better -- the descending levels are interspersed with a ramp, so it's wheelchair friendly!One block-long section on the west side is a functioning fountain of sorts, with running water cascading over the concrete. Benches line the east side of that section, so park visitors can take their shoes off and get their feet wet. Of course, this is cute on opening day but I suspect the 3000th visitor to tempt fate is going to catch something that makes them smell like the old Fulton Fish Pier in August. (It may also explain the no-dogs rule.)The Highline is a park unique to NYC, and unique from other parks we have here. I've never seen anything quite like it. If you lean on a railing overlooking the street below, don't be surprised if someone yells to you -- ""Hey! How do we get up there!?"" And if that happens, point 'em south to Gansevoort Street. For now, that's the only entrance.Exits are available at 14th, 16th, 18th & 20th Streets. Elevator / wheelchair access at 16th Street. Section Two of Highline Park will run from 20th to 30th Streets and is slated to open in 2010. The 3rd section of track, from 30th to 34th Streets is owned by CSX train corporation and they haven't decided yet to allow park planners to continue the growth of the highline for the full length of track.

Beautiful white walls, tan wooden furniture contrasted only by the delightful array of colors displayed on every plate. Real Crab, Real Lobster not the bland artificial unauthentic tasteless dribble most restaurants like to include in their dishes. The crab artichoke dip was chock full of hearty pieces of crab complimented by buttered triangles of crust less bread.

1873,16,10,5.0,"If you've never tried Taiwanese food, 66 is a great place to expand your culinary repertoire. Food is tasty, service is fast (if a little brusque), and the price is not bad. Most rice dishes won't run you more than $6-$7 and nothing hits the spot like a comfort food dish like porkchop over rice.We came for dinner recently and ate family-style and I really recommend the minced pork over handmade white noodles, which is a spicy meat sauce over thick, chewy noodles. Watercress and minced pork is a classic dish that you are guaranteed to see on most tables, and the double cooked pork belly is a savory, melt-in-your-mouth restaurant favorite. Moo shu pork was also a real treat, and completely different from what you'd expect at your local chinese takeout. Imagine shredded pork, lettuce, mushrooms, and other veggie delights mixed in a flavorful sauce, wrapped in a thin, nearly see-through pancake, and dipped in a sweet plum and peanut sauce. Yum! Everything at 66's is really flavorful, with just the right amount of spice and sweetness to really make mouths water. Part of the allure of Taiwanese cuisine is that they use a wide variety of spices and herbs, both fresh and fermented, leading to food that is simultaneously simple and complex. I do caution that the cuisine is notorious for a lot of pork and intestinal foods but I think the dishes we ordered were pretty ""safe"" and caters to a Cantonese palate. There are plenty of dishes for every diet/preference. Still, I encourage you to be more adventurous and to eat family style so that you can taste a wide variety of foods. Even though this place is regularly packed, turnover is quick so your group won't wait long to get a table.",16,0.9826

1877,12,8,5.0,"It's almost unfair to rate pizza shops in New York City since everyone knows the best one, everyone's got a favorite slice and in general, there's always some subliminal bias tied to it... Say, which borough it's in or how esoteric it is.Lucali is an amazing pizza shop. I've been to many in Brooklyn, from the greasy slice place in every neighborhood to the high, mighty and gourmet emporia of more recent days (this is closer to the latter) where a pie costs twice what it should and the wait is thrice as long as any normal person should stand around to eat what used to be peasant food. OK, that was a bitchy way to start. Sorry, back to Lucali...Their pizza is really good - It's all fresh mozzarella-type with rustic, almost gourmet bread-quality crust (maybe the water in Brooklyn really does make the difference). The pies are huge and they've remained very, very basic with the technique applied to the crust and to the ingredients you can have put on your pizza. There is no foie gras to be had and they left the truffle oil in their shopping cart at Eli's, where it belongs (seriously, what is with the gratuitous use of truffle oil on everything at some places in this city?). The toppings available are essentially the type you'll find at many typical New York City pizza places - Basic, occasionally necessary and all very enjoyable (you know, pepperoni, peppers, mushrooms, etc.). The pies are all made to order and there's a certain old-fashioned and clearly authentic element to them that I appreciate. The menu is otherwise limited with some small appetizer and/or calzone-related offerings (the calzone was very good, by the way), although the pizza is what it's all about. The shop itself is essential Old Brooklyn to me. I think it was a former luncheonette/general store-type thing because of the remnants of old lighting, signs, shelves, and the old awning outside that all point toward that. Very (very!) dimly lit with exposed brick and cramped beyond belief, it does not belie its location in Carroll Gardens, which I always think of as a relatively old-school neighborhood anyway. This is, however, by no means a neighborhood hang-out. I am told that pizza enthusiasts come from far-and-wide to dine here, and the crowd is certainly diverse. The wait staff is an assortment of adorable locals with a good deal of enthusiasm. They're extremely friendly and accommodating (even with diners who ask too many questions and/or can't make up their mind), and I think that in itself adds a certain quality element to the place. Lucali is also BYOB, which is a nice touch (they'll uncork your bottle and provide you glasses), so you can bring your own Montepulciano (or Franzia...) to please. The only problem I have with this place is the fact that they have limited hours and don't take reservations. Of course, neither of those is limited to Lucali itself, but indulge me while I regale you with tales of the time we were more-or-less told that they're too good for reservations. I am confounded. Bad enough that they have a very limited amount of seats, but when we cheekily inquired with the owner/""pizzaiolo"" (a k a the guy flipping the dough) about this policy, the answer became clear. Owning a popular restaurant in South Brooklyn (it used to be called that, my father tells me) that serves food that follows fad allows restauranteurs and chefs to give self-importance a new meaning.... and while serving pizza (like I said, former/current (?) peasant food!). ""You've come a long way, baby!"" Highly recommended.",13,0.9793

Easily 6 stars if Yelp would let me have the honor.The longer review:I went here with Jeff C.'s meetup group. This was my first outing with them, and there was no Jeff C. :-( But there was Chef Yasuda in front of me at the sushi bar all night -- wow! We were pretty indecisive about what to order. We inquired about an omakase, but they really don't do that. But he was willing to choose selections for us in the context of our sushi matsu (12 pieces of sushi and a half roll for $36), and then we would be free to make individual orders after that.Instead of serving everything at once, each piece of sushi is individually prepared and served. This is more intimate, and really builds up the experience with a crescendo of anticipation and increasing quality. Chef Yasuda is very amiable and jocular; but he is also a skilled salesman. While talking to you and having you be distracted, fresh prepared sushi would magically appear on your plate from nowhere -- he is so good! Stand outs in the Matsu were the eel (layers of flavor, unlike any eel I have ever had in my life), the shrimp (prepared fresh which makes a very big difference in taste; usually shrimp is a miss for me), and actually everything else -- there was nothing I didn't like, alot!My additional selections were the two recommended types of eel, the orato, and the arctic char with the latter two selections garnering a ""good choice"" from the master himself! Wow, perfection achieved once again. They even offer an inexpensive house hot sake which I thought paired well with all of the selections -- in fact, I had two of these!What did I learn from talking with the master for nearly 2 hours?- Iron Chef Japan is just entertainment/television. They know the ingredients 2 weeks in advance.- He deferred on naming other chefs that he likes, but did say he likes bangers and mash. - He enjoys watching WWE wrestling. Doesn't follow sumo wrestling. And really doesn't have time to watch movies.- He is on-site everyday for lunches and dinner. If he takes time to travel, he goes back to Japan to visit his older, ailing mother. - When he was younger he traveled in the western U.S., particularly loving Wyoming, Colorado, and Sedona Arizona. He's a country guy at heart.- He uses 2 grains of rice, both from Sacramento in his sushi.- He never drinks on the job, and doesn't find the practice respectful.- He can make 5 sushi rolls in a minute. His hands moved so fast, I think he has a magic act on his days off. - Sushi should be eaten with the fish facing up, contrary to sushi union propaganda (his term). You don't eat a pizza upside-down he says. Food for thought. (bad pun)And so much more. He was so approachable, and even posed for photos. All around great experience and great guy.

In Media Res.A little after midnight on an unseasonably warm night in December, under the dim glow of Craft's shrewd Edison bulbs, I fell in love. It wasn't with the rustic decor, or even with Tom Colicchio's aphrodisastic reductions; I was dosed up on sweets and and rosy with rose, and caught myself filled with the familiar dread associated with deep, romantic longing, as I suddenly remembered that I had a plane to catch. ii. That week.I'd been living on borrowed time; I'd forfeited my lease and my job in favor of adventures on foreign shores. China to be exact, and in one of many concurrent 'fuck-yous' to conventional wisdom, I chose to spend my final nights in the bicepted snuggery of the rakish desperado down the hall. As my imminent departure loomed, M. and I decided to keep ish ""casual"".  Four hours before preemptively nostalgic I was to redeem a one-way ticket to the other side of the world: still stuffing underwears into irritable side pockets, sulky, from this morning's too-short, too-stiff farewell. My malaise is interrupted by an unexpected phone call from M.; he'd like me to accompany him to the holiday dinner to commemorate the first, successful year of the company that was his New York raison d'etre. He will purchase a new plane ticket for me.The afternoon passes like a Disney made-for-television-movie montage. Gaybestfriend takes me to Guy Laroche, where I'm gussied up like a fairy princess by the salesman, who all but gifts me my first couture piece when I tell the story of the occasion. The counter girls at Henri Bendel (befriended during wanton weekend afternoons) flutter by to tinge (already flushed) cheeks and moisten (quivering) lips like helpful sparrows. And then, before I knew it - there I was, in a luxurious Gramercy flat, meeting the oft-named, heroic heads of this scrappy operation that's tamed, through fulfillment, M.'s terrific wanderlust and mind. A dozen scotches later, four smug Manhattan men and their four, patently overdressed, over-coiffed dates made our way round the corner to Craft. iii. CraftWe spent the next four hours pecking at everything on the menu - fat-rolled bacon strips, garlicky hen-of-the-woods, a rich smoked duck, buttery spinach - and getting better acquainted with one another. There was wine, there were martinis. There were jokes, toasts, roasts, and allegedly a groundhog, dismembered and marinated beyond recognition, and consumed. The fellas were exceptionally skilled conversationalists, and dictated a wonderfully jovial, warm and intimate mood - bolstered, no doubt, by their choice of venue; a humble-but-elegant, family-style space done up in inviting earth tones and wood. There was a pleasant waitstaff that good-naturedly tolerated our inebriated, increasingly wild requests, which, at the close, included an off-the-menu dessert tasting menu. The restaurant closed long before we departed, but we never felt rushed, and were instead privy to additional rounds of private digestifs, and, when drowsy and full of limoncello and souffle, a doggie bag of breakfast treats to take home. iv. Aft CraftI was more aglow with top-shelf liqueurs than I'd ever been, and happily conflated the flush of wine with the twitterpated rush of True Love. I fell into his arms; Guy Laroche slipped to the floor. When I boarded the plane in the morning, I was still glutted with Craft's rich meats and dessert wine and the memory of the loveliest last evening imaginable; and thusly, in longing, Shanghai'd.",29,0.9976

Whether that has to do with people at work who are distinctly smarter than I, or buildings that are taller than fifty of myself placed one on top of the other, or witnessing people I know buying apartments that I know are well beyond my reach. So why would I subject myself to the same effect from the spacious setting and super high ceilings of my neighborhood Whole Foods Market? Here are ten likely reasons.Checkout lines: seriously fast, with the express checkout smartly separated from the slower lines. Quite a change from Columbus CircleLocal crowd: neighborhood regulars and friendly checkout clerks make for a pleasant shopping experience.Salad bar: well marked. And I don't fancy chickpeas mixed with shredded carrot, as you might notice in Chelsea.Free samples: especially nice since no one is seemingly watching as I reach for a second helping, as at Trader Joe's.Mini carts: I wonder why they retired them at the Union Square location a few months ago. Compact and convenient.Organization: by far the best organized Whole Foods location. I could now do 80-85% of my shopping blindfolded.Upstairs seating: I would guess an average occupancy of less than 10% across my visits to date--go figure.Location: combine with a trip to the quietest Barnes & Noble in town, that is in the same building as Whole Foods.Spacious feel: try visiting during the morning or late evening hours. You can breeze through the aisles and the checkout.Free mini bags: if you are lucky, you will find two-inch square brown bags at the customer service desk, complete with handles.There are a few evident shortcomings. The staff is good-natured but not sharp or quick. The assortment is not as extensive as the Bowery location's.

The interior manages to be understated while totally gorgeous and incredibly romantic. Take a cue from UrbanDaddy and sweet-talk your way into reserving table 35 (see pic -- usually only for parties of four, but I'm pleased to report that they make exceptions).The reservation person must have made note when I mentioned it was our anniversary, because in addition to hearing, ""we have a special booth just for you,"" upon entrance, the manager came by moments later with complimentary glasses of bubbly, thanking us for choosing A&D to celebrate our special occasion. Compared with the aloofness and airs of pretension that often accompany fine dining in NYC, the gesture was refreshing and thoughtful.

Alex's menu (nrnstandardsandpours.blo…) takes inspiration from a few select spirits / components, and offers two versions of each: ""No. 1 is light and festive...meant to refresh the mind and whet the appetite, while No. 2 showcase base spirit...best enjoyed with thought, time and good conversation.""

Plating was impressive in that ""I don't want to mess this up but then again, I'm going to demolish it"" kind of way.

As it turns out, De Mole is a very pleasant and simple space, much more reminiscent of something you'd find on Smith Street than just a few blocks from Queens Boulevard. I'll have to agree with the masses here; this is the best Mexican I've had in New York. I don't know what they do to make their salsa, but it is magical. Our scallop ceviche was fresh and tangy, and the salsa verde on my chicken enchiladas had the perfect spicy kick. J's shredded pork in a banana leaf was juicy and tender, and the warm corn tortillas were so good we had to get a second serving, for which we were only charged an astounding fifty cents. Fifty cents!! And our server was like, really concerned that we understood that we'd have to pay fifty cents if we wanted more tortillas. We assured him that we could handle the surcharge.Which brings me to the prices here. It's a little ridiculous how cheap everything is--$6 for a burrito? $8 enchiladas? My jaw just dropped when I opened the menu, and my wallet did a little dance of joy in my bag when I whispered to it that it wouldn't go home empty.

1886,32,24,5.0,"""It's all good"". That's the writing on the wall.It took me 6 months and close to half a dozen visits to realize that Luzzo's is absolutely my favorite pizza in Manhattan. It might be because I am more culturally attuned to New York style pizza, than to Neapolitan style pizza. It might also be that I didn't appreciate its simplistic genius the first few times. And, all too often humility is an under-appreciated virtue. Surrounded by many big names in pizza, and in all the hoopla created by ""The Choke"", it was easy to overlook Luzzo's.Ironically, I discovered Luzzo's by accident. I had planned a get together of friends at the nearby Una Pizza Napoletana without realizing that they were closed for the day. Prodded by hunger, we took a chance at this unassuming restaurant nearby which had the rustic feel of a small café in Italy. As we conversed with the servers, we realized from the language barrier that this indeed was the real deal. All the servers and the Pizzaioli were Italian, and by that I do not mean from Italy by way of Staten Island. Yes - I am looking at you, Artichoke ;)I liked Luzzo's pizza then, but at that time I wasn't sure that I loved it. The texture of the pizza was soft and chewy. It was thin, but not crispy, except at the edges. Charred by the coal oven, the crust was definitely unique. The sauce was simple, sweet and tangy, and made perhaps from canned tomatoes. The creamy mozzarella di Buffala was the star, extremely fresh and uniquely presented in the shape of large polka dots all over the pizza. It was exquisitely light, and delicious.But, I wasn't sold on the crust. Used to the crispier NYC version, I found the pizza chewy, and at times a little bland. Over a period of time, I got to appreciate the fact that this pizza was perfectly executed per Neapolitan standards. A well made pizza in Naples is described as one where you can fold the pizza in half and then again into quarters, without cracking or breaking the crust. This is definitely the case with Luzzo's, which is one of the most pliant in the city! Also, the pizzaioli have started charring the crust more, making better use of the coal oven. So, now not only do you have the desired chewiness, but the crust is also crisper and with a number of bubbles. I have struggled with this five star rating. One of the problems of authenticity is challenges in communication. At times, my pizza order has been delayed because the multiple servers haven't coordinated well between them. I have also found the Pastiera (Italian cake made with ricotta cheese and candied fruit) to be refrigerated and not as texturally complex as other versions in the city. I also fear that they will be unable to handle the crowds as their fame spreads. In short, their management skills are untested.But, in mirroring the mood of the country, I decided to overlook my present fears and concerns about their ability to deliver in the future and bumped them up to five stars. I can not fault them for authenticity, genius, and flair. Heck, I can even overlook a Martha Stewart endorsement for that.",34,0.9801

The chefs were extremely nice and chatted with us about each dish and answered all my inane questions.10 courses later, 10 wine pairings later, I was happy. Extremely.Highlights of the meal:Shaved foie gras torchon with Riesling jelly and brittle: Hands down, favorite course of the night. I have read about this dish so many times that I could practically taste it via Yelp reviews. The juxtaposition of textures were absolutely incredible -- the mounds of foie gras melted in your mouth while the brittle gave it a simultaneous crunch. The sweet and savory flavors were sublime together, melding into perfection. To me, this dish was innovative and thoughtful.Pork belly with kimchi consomme and grilled rice: The infamous David Chang pork belly. If there is one protein that I could eat on a daily basis, it would be pork belly. The skin was perfectly crispy and smoky, the protein tender with the appropriate overload of fat.The consomme was absolutely delicious and complimented the grilled rice cube and belly nicely. It was a simple dish but with perfect execution.Fluke with buttermilk: Understated but bursting with flavor and texture. As one of the earlier courses, it whetted my palate for all the amazing dishes to come. Elegant and simple, yet ultimately satisfying.Steak with artichoke puree, jalapenos, and cauliflower: The meat was perfectly prepared to a tender and succulent medium rare. The accompaniment of the jalapeno sauce was SO perfect. I was skeptical at first of this pairing but once I put it in my mouth (that's what she said), it made sense. It just worked. It was intricate but prepared so flawlessly. Funnel cake with black sesame ice cream: I thought it was very clever to end this elegant 10 course meal with funnel cake. Funnel cake brings back memories of fairs and amusement parks. This was like funnel cake on steroids. Deep fried dough topped with powdered sugar and served alongside black sesame ice cream and cream. Divine.The wine pairings were spot on in my opinion. Not a wines/spirits connoisseur by any means, I thought the pairings were thoughtful and well balanced. And well, I got drunk.I really could not ask for a better birthday meal. My mouse clicking inferiority complex was worth it. Ko lives up to the hype - if you love food, you'll love Ko.",33,0.9984
1888,18,4,5.0,"With its impressive outside sign and massive seafood tank, Everett gets kudos for standing out amongst the Chinese businesses along 8th avenue but more importantly gets my nod for the best Chinese restaurant in Brooklyn Chinatown. There are few places that can emulate the quality of selection Everett has to offer. I can't think any establishment in the area that has a more extensive menu of Seafood and Fujian style specialties. To add to that, they have fast service, excellent prices, and feature a splendid decor.As I mentioned in my previous review, everything about the restaurant almost distinctly caters to a Chinese crowd (menu selection, CCTV news, and even the karaoke) but I have seen some non-Chinese in here on occasion.  The waitresses do speak some English, but coming with someone who may speak Mandarin would likely help the dining experience tremendously.The dishes just keep getting better and better during each visit. There is no question the food is of superior quality, with plenty of flavor and freshness, and can cater to a variety of palates. There are some standard Cantonese / Northern Chinese dishes available as well, but I advise most folks to get a little adventurous and order their homestyle dishes (i.e. Steamed Mantis Shrimp, Fukinese King Crab, etc.), especially the ones that are less likely to be found in other establishments. On a whole, this place is hard to miss and even harder to pass up for folks who can appreciate true authentic cuisine. The sign on the outside glows into the night while all of the tiny markets and bakeries close for the after hours. Though the place looks deceivingly small upon entering, there is also a basement level (a la Congee Village) for big groups who want a private dining experience. They are open late, but the best time to go is during the dinner hour and even better if one can score a table on the weekend.",18,0.996
1889,43,30,5.0,"This is my 100th review - as silly as it sounds, I wanted it to be special, as I don't think I'm gonna be posting hundreds upon hundreds of reviews (...famous last words?).So I racked my brain for what to review. What was worthy?When push came to shove, I realized it had to be Madison Square Park. I dig a bunch of parks, but I love MSP for many reasons and we'll get to them shortly. First -THE REASONS TO HATE:1) There's a fairly high concentration of homeless people, especially on the park boundaries; I don't particularly frown upon homeless people (hey, I'm a few bucks and a few bits of luck away from being one myself), but today on the south side a man decided to repeatedly make sounds that were reminiscent of the Muppet, Animal, except not quite as refined. Lame.2) The squirrels are daredevils to the point that it makes me nervous. Today a squirrel saw it fit to plop down inches away from my head while I sat on a bench, startling the crap out of me. What a bugger.Squirrels are also bloody thieves. One stole my last french fry when I wasn't looking. This was ages ago, but some things you just don't get over. Tip - don't set food down next to you on the bench while you tie your shoe.3) The park isn't that great for laying out, in my opinion. Parks should make you wanna lay out and picnic. This park is just serviceable.So there, I've nitpicked a bit so you don't think I'm all googoogaga blindly in love. But let's keep in mind that love is hardly perfect; many would say love is all about recognizing your betrothed's warts, of which Madison Square Park has a few (I'm sure you could find even more outlined in the other reviews). I've accepted these blemishes, and have done so because of THE REASONS TO LOVE:1) Love itself. I'm going to be painfully honest here; part of Madison Square Park's appeal is the fact that some of the most significant boy-girl moments in Alan Apples history have occurred here. Nothing lewd, no public romps, but rather just the sappy, sweet stuff you try to ignore taking about in real life but will be forthcoming with on Yelp?*Shakes head.* Consider the following to be a centennial review treat - If you were my best friend who's never been to New York, I'd take you on a tour of MSP and point to the bench where I sat in the wee hours of the morning talking with this girl I was positively crazy about back in the day. This incident laid the groundwork for one of the more memorable smooches of my life, as the girl ended up being the first girl to ""make the move"" on me. I mean, us guys, we're the ones who usually make the move, right? Well, this time the girl was so utterly charmed by me that she just couldn't help herself; she kissed me - the audacity!Unfortunately I had an incredibly serious bout of the flu at the time. Needless to say, I couldn't bring the hawt lovin'; she would later tell me that she thought of me ""like a brother,"" a classic FML moment.I'd then walk you, my best friend, around the bend and show you where I met the cutest dog in the world (half Chow Chow/half ?) with a classmate one late summer day. Our class had been canceled, so we just spontaneously stumbled here, talking whilst observing the filming of ""I Am Legend.""Later, a bike messenger would catcall at her by shouting at me,""DAMNNN BRO, YOU GOT YOSELF A DIMEEE!""We laughed it off at the time, but you know what? He was right. She later became my girl for a bit (my girlfriend, for all intensive purposes, but without the title). The year after that I found myself in the park once again with someone new. Since you're my best friend, I'd say, ""Remember that girl I emailed you about so much? Right here, by this fountain. I'll never forget it. I don't think I've ever been more in love than I've been right here with that girl, one night.""Fancy that - mention MSP and I'm a regular Carrie Bradshaw!Let's move on.2) Speaking of amorous feelings and of love, the Shake Shack is here, and it really is love when you wait at least 45 minutes for a burger and fries. Goshdarnit, I'm not overusin' the term here! I know I'll never forget my first time. Mmm baby.3) BASEBALL! MSP is believed to be the birthplace of baseball? No really, check it out - madisonsquarepark.org/ab…. While the Mets break my heart year in and year out (it's an abusive relationship; don't even get me started about these past two years...), I sure as hell remain in love with baseball.4) Um, you get a great view of the Empire State Building AND the Flatiron Building - that's downright sexy.5) bigapplebbq.org. YUM!6) I was here today and saw a man teach his lil girl how to ride a bike. *Cue the AWWWWs.*7) Last but certainly not least, I hear Yelp NY HQ is around here, which obviously sends my heart aflutter.Yeah. You'll always get 5 stars from me, Madison Square Park.",31,0.9988
1890,24,16,5.0,"The highly sought after ""Best Pizza in New York"" has rendered a trip to the Island of Staten, where it plays host to Denino's Pizzeria & Tavern. Despite the $10.00 toll faced with having to cross the Verrazano, the hefty tariff was paid to experience the highly acclaimed offerings of this establishment.The establishment: Segmented into four primary sections, the feel of Denino's resembles a local neighborhood bar. Wood tables with metal chairs aides in the simplistic décor of this establishment. There's not much to comment on in terms of décor, the establishment is really simplistic, as patrons of Denino's are here more for the pizza, than that of the experience of the décor.The Food...Appetizer (1) - Fried Calamari ($7.00): In lieu of the simplistic presentation which consisted of a heap of Calamari and 2 small containers of Tomato Sauce, the taste and boldness derived from the application was exquisite. The textural contrast between the crispy fried peripheral complemented the smooth and soft nature of the Calamari. The taste too complimented the textural composition of the application. Light hints of salt and garlic played well in both taste and aromatics of the application. Patrons ordering the Fried Calamari will find that the simplistic nature but bold taste and texture of the Calamari will render second orders.Appetizer (2) - Mozzarella Sticks ($6.00): The concept of adding a Saturated Fat to a consumable that already contains Saturated Fat derives phantoms of debauchery in the mental equilibrium. Nevertheless, I speak with high regard that the Mozzarella Sticks at Denino's is by far the best I've had up to this point of my existence. The lightly breaded and deep fried mozzarella is served with a side of tomato sauce. At first consumption, patrons will find that the Italian seasoning used in the breading of the outer exterior complements the smooth, milky texture of the inner confines that holds the Mozzarella. The mozzarella itself produced a mild sweetness, that's greatly aided by the velvety texture for which it was derived. The centerpiece of the application is derived from the proper balance of the savory mozzarella, that's complemented with the mild saltiness from the Italian seasoning. Given the complexity of the crispy exterior while maintaining the integrity of the confined mozzarella, the application in both taste and presentation is strikingly impressive.Pizza (1) - Margherita Pizza ($16.00): The staple in sampling the renderings of a Pizzeria, the Margherita not only met our highest aspirations but inspired a humbling appreciation for the technique and execution of Denino's application. The Margherita starts with a medium thick crust (one that's slightly thicker than your average thin crust) that plays host to a layering of San Marzano Tomato Sauce, and Sliced Fresh Mozzarella. The application is finished off with a hefty sprinkling of Fresh Basil. At first taste, the charred smokiness of the pizza crust was the keynote of the application. The slightly burnt crust, which hinted notes of bitterness, worked in conjunction with the bold flavorings of the tomato sauce. The application was further aided by the sweet and velvety texture of the fresh mozzarella. The last trifle that's noted in the application is the earthiness derived from the fresh basil. All of the elements of the application ranging from the mild hint of pepper in the tomato sauce to the perfectly cooked crust added another dimension to the quality of this Pizza. Despite the urge to detect a flaw of this application, it was easy to say that Denino's Pizza did not possess such a flaw. Everything ranging from the use of ingredients, cooking techniques, and taste were met with great satisfaction.Pizza (2) - Garbage Pizza ($18.50): The application, consists of a heavy coating of Mozzarella (not fresh), Sausage, Pepperoni, Mushroom, and Onion works in concurrence to produce a slightly heartier Pizza than it's counterpart, the Margherita DOP. At first bite, the elements that were first observed are that of the toppings used in the application. The aromatics stemming from the Italian sausage was complemented by heat and spiciness of the Pepperoni. Both of these elements became the predominant factor in the consumption process, as the crispy and clean taste of the mushroom and onion became an afterthought. All elements of the pizza (crust, sauce, and cheese) acted as a stage for the toppings used in this application. The pizza provided a subtle balance of doughy texture to the meaty nature of this application. Patrons will find that the flavor renderings of salt, heat, and tart are the key components to this application. Certainly, the Garbage Pizza is one most appreciated by the Meat Lovers in all of us.Know Before You Go...1) CASH ONLY!2) Beers are $3 to $4 a pop3) Wait time varies: 5 minutes to 2 hours4) Recommended: Margherita Pizza5) Cost Per Person: $25 to $30",28,0.9981
1891,19,14,5.0,"What do I enjoy after a hectic week of busy city life? 1) Japanese-esque things2) Quiet, peace, and relaxation3) Vibrant colors, nature and sunny daysSo what do I crave? The Botanical Gardens, totally.Venue:A garden? What? Flowers? Green? Grass? Trees? What are you talking about? Yes, yes, New Yorkers, these things exist. They are not far off in the mountains of upstate or only found in the Midwest. No! You too can experience nature, right in the comfort of your own city limits!! Who knew?!?I did! Aside from Central Park which is way too big, way too packed with people on the first day of warmth and sunshine, there is an utterly fantastic place a person can go to bask in nature. You can walk (no sitting!) on the grassy fields barefoot, and you can wander along paths lined with flowers and trees. Acres of green (yes green!) are there for you enjoyment, so go enjoy!My reason for heading to BBG this past weekend was because it was time for my annual hanami (flower viewing). It's a Japanese tradition--a pastime, really--where you go, camp out under some sakura trees and watch the flowers. Eat, drink, be merry! Think Fourth of July with less noise and more reverence. I love hanami, and I love Japanese pasttimes, so it made me very happy! Sure, the people were a bit noisy and there weren't quite as many full blooms as I would have liked, but it was awesomely relaxing. Exactly what I was looking for.I could discuss the other areas as well as the conservatory, but why don't you go check them out yourself? I'll update during the matsuri, with more venue specs, for now, just go enjoy the flowers.Food:They have a few places to eat and a few cart vendors--as well as strict no food and beverage policy. Oh well, we snuck in some onigiri, mochi and Ichiban for our hanami. No picnicing? Too bad, we did!!!

It was a crowded Friday night, so Brian, the owner, gladly made room for us at the bar and set us up with some Goat Cheese Hazelnut Truffles. (I had to capitalize that, as my group pounced on them the way a lion would pounce on a baby elk -- with ferocity and lipsmacking enjoyment.)We ordered a bottle of Muscadet and some snacks. The olives and pickles were great to munch on, and the other couple particularly loved the cheese-stuffed jalapeno peppers. We swirled and sniffed and snacked and chatted, falling in love with the warm atmosphere in Casellula. Maybe it was the wine. Maybe it was the cheese. Maybe it was cold winter evening.

You come here to propose. You come here to celebrate. You come here because on the X-thousandth occasion of your wife mentioning how much she'd like to go there you finally get the hint. So, you sell 30 shares of Exxon and make reservations two months in advance.This place is a complete experience from the moment you're greeted until the moment you receive the bill and stagger out in a state of shock. The service is unparalleled and the food is exquisite.So you would think you might - just once - put the phone away.Our starter was someone who I kept calling Ralph Fiennes because he looked a lot like Ralph Fiennes. He was on his mobile phone for more than half his meal. He had an attractive exterior but I felt his soul was a bit lacking and his manners were too salty. He had the wherewithal to keep his conversation quiet, as if muttering to a mistress, but that doesn't change the fact that rather than experiencing Per Se he was working on growing a brain tumor. I hope when they returned home his companion denied him sex before setting him on fire.For an entrée we enjoyed the couple pre-occupied with texting. Perhaps they'd asked the baby-sitter to deliver a play-by-play on Twitter. Barely a word was muttered between them. Ultimately I found they lacked substance and left a bitter aftertaste.For dessert there was the guy who doesn't know how to turn his ringer off.

My younger brother is allergic to Peanuts, so my Parents forbid me from ever having any. In my first year of college, my roommate came home late with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. He asked if I wanted a piece and I figured that I was just experimenting. At first, I told myself that I would only eat PB&j's on the weekends. Then I started eating them on Mondays and before you knew it, I was completely addicted to PB&Js and I was eating them everyday. I stopped going to class, got kicked out of school, and had to go back home where I started stealing money and stuff around the house to get my peanut butter fix. My parents kicked me out and I was forced to sleep in Washington Square Park. This is where I found other PB&J junkies like myself. They took me to Peanut Butter &Co.

1897,35,34,5.0,"Hurrying out of the 72nd station, I am met with the busy traffic of Broadway. I wait patiently for the light to change, and when it does, scurry across the intersection and into Gray's Papaya. It's just a hot dog, I know. It's a simple hot dog from a garishly decorated store, but this little corner store is one of my favorite places. To say that I love this place because it's cheap and delicious would be an understatement. But more than anything, I am utterly devoted to this tiny hot dog shop because it's when I'm standing at the counter with a hot dog and a papaya drink in hand, watching the cars streak across on Broadway, that I am most conscious that I am in New York. I like standing at the counter facing Broadway and watching the busy lives of New York scrambling by. I like waving at the police officer in his dark suit with a shiny badge as he strolls past the large window. I like laughing to myself as a pedestrian yells profanity to a reckless cab driver right on 72nd and Broadway. I like how Gray's Papaya is always playing classic rock. I like the dusty and dirty paper fruits hanging from the ceiling; it's so tacky and cheesy, that it's awesome. I like how the folks working here wear pins that say, ""I am a polite New Yorker."" I like chuckling to myself as I hear the New Yorker groan in frustration as the tourist customer takes forever while ordering. I like the all the strange characters that come to this store at all hours of the day. I like New York. And I like these hot dogs. These little hot dogs changed my perspectives on franks and sausages. Prior to Gray's Papaya, I've lived by the adage that the bigger the wiener, the better. In fact, the sausage of choice for my buns was the big fat Irish banger (get your dirty mind out of the gutter, you pervert). So when I got my first Gray's hot dog, I remember looking at it suspiciously, wondering what the hype is about such a skinny little wiener. But after the first bite I've come to realize that size does not matter. It was Gray's that taught me the beauty of a snappy hot dog. Is there any greater joy than biting into a hot little frank and feeling the casing snap? And as someone who probably ate her weight in Gray's papaya three times over (here's a confession: I did not get a monthly MTA pass for the month of March in an effort to curb my wiener appetite after I realized that I went to Gray's Papaya 5 times in one week), I can say that these hot dogs will be snappy every single time. And the Gray's Papaya hot dog doesn't just stop at the casing. After that beautiful snap, it gets even better as the perfectly grilled 100% beef franks ooze meaty juice. And the meat itself is so damn tasty too. Though it may not have fancy seasoning, it's simplicity perfected. I always get the recession special. Two hot dogs and a drink (I always get papaya; that thing is quite delicious too and helps me delude myself that my diet of Gray's Papaya 5 days a week isn't completely unhealthy) for $3.50 is a steal, even if they had raised the prices from $2.75. $3.50 is cheaper than a gallon of gas, a box of cereal, a carton of strawberries, and a bottle of water at some places. As I said, I love New York, and I love these hot dogs. (Oh, you bet your little wieners I wrote my 100th review about hot dogs.

1899,25,18,5.0,"Like many other ramen fiends in NYC, I had been eagerly anticipating the opening of Ippudo for some time. After reading all the glowing reviews that quickly came in, the anticipation was reaching a crescendo, yet something was holding me back from making the special trip there. I suppose I feared that the reviews were overrated and Ippudo would be overhyped, like Ramen Setegaya and Momofuku were for me.Alas, I can happily say that Ippudo lived up to its hype and deserves all the high praise it's been receiving from ramen aficionados. Going at lunchtime is a great way to avoid waiting on the 45min. - 1.5 hr lines that I've been hearing about. I came in after 3pm and was quickly seated at a nearly empty communal round table, which gave me a front row glimpse into the kitchen. The bamboo ""tree"" that ""shaded"" me was a nice touch and reminded me of a bamboo sculpture I had seen at the NY Botanical Garden last fall. The raised hiragana on the walls was also really cool, although I'm incredibly rusty with my Japanese and couldn't make any sense of it.But you're not really coming to Ippudo for the decor or ambiance, are you? Honestly, if Ippudo was another hole-in-the-wall ramen joint like many others in the city, you'd still be happy to slurp up every last drop of your soup. Because, damn is that broth fantastic. It's so rich and thick with flavor - I believe it when they say that they simmer their pork bones for 14+ hours. I had the Akamaru ramen, which came with extra special sauce. The pork slices melted in my mouth, and there were bits of ground pork canoodling with my noodles. There was only one drop of soup left in my bowl by the time I was done, and that's only because I was too embarrassed to lift the bowl to my mouth. I usually don't bother finishing the soup when I eat ramen because I'm too full, but there is such a nice balance of pork, noodle and broth that you don't feel like a glutton lapping it all up. Best of all, I didn't even feel bloated afterwards, just satisfied.Aside from the amazing ramen, the overall experience at Ippudo is very pleasant. The service is typically Japanese - prompt, courteous and efficient. They also serve complimentary tea at the end of your meal. When I was finishing my first cup and they thought that I was lingering, they brought me another one, which was unexpected but appreciated. Ippudo definitely tops my ramen list and the wait was well worth it.  And when you think about it, $13 is a small price to pay for a genuinely delicious taste of Japan.P.S. Add the braised pork belly to your ramen for $3 - it's melt in your mouth yummy!",30,0.9978

Unexpectedly, I lock eyes across the sea of drunken old people, with a beautiful brunette who had just walked in. I subtly try to get my wingman, Brian B, to go over and talk to her for me. I look up to realize that she's watching me tell him. Doh. She smiles shyly, and comes over to me.She asked me what I do. I told her I work on bridges.

Our hands lightly touched. I saw her blushing cheeks under the glowing moon. The scene was reminiscent of movie love montages with Savage Garden playing in the background.So we reach the Brooklyn end of the bridge. We shyly exchange glances back and forth.

I'm just gonna dive in awkwardly by yelling and see what comes of it:OMG JOE: THE ART OF COFFEE IS pretty much my new favorite place to go every morning [see, I'm in the zone now] despite the schlep from my work.To be fair, I've only ordered one thing--a soy au lait--so that's all I can comment on, but man is it good. Their house coffee is really rich and full-bodied. It was a welcome change to have something resembling quality as opposed to Starbucks where I feel the need to order fancy syrups and all that just to make my lukewarm latte-drink palatable. (""Latte-drink"" is to actual good coffee what ""Yoo-Hoo Chocolate Drink"" is to real chocolate milk from that place in Chelsea.)Anyway, I eventually switched it up and started getting my au lait with a Mexican Chiapas brew, which is also really good, but in a lighter, almost sweet kind of way. So they're two for two.The pastry case is sparse sometimes, but the stuff comes from different bakeries and people around the city, and I've yet to find anything that's not fresh and delicious. No more stale banana chocolate chip coffee cake for me plz n ty!Right, also the kids that work here are always super-friendly, which brings me to my next important point: Nobody's allowed to go here if you're going to steal Sexy Latte Boy away from me, and I'm totally serious about that, I'll kick your ass!

As usual she relied on the reviews of our famous Yelpers and we were not disappointed!! With 4 and 5 stars you can't lose.We took the # 7 train to 46th St/Bliss station and walked 5 minutes to reach this well reviewed (54times) restaurant. The corner place was small (26 seats) but tastefully decorated with a huge mirror on one side and a gigantic picture of a big apple on the other brick side wall. There are a couple of hanging lights .. very cozy. and simple. A small bar is in one corner. Each table has tea lights and they have one waiter. The place was half full or was it half empty when we arrived. but a couple of peoplecame in right after.. As soon as we were seated I ordered the Guacamole while browsing over the menu. It was delicious!! We also had the Ceviche De Veracruz...Diced Sea scallops with fresh Lime juice, diced Red Onion, tomatoes,Jalapenos ,Avocado,Cucumber,Cilantro and drenched in olive oil .Really good. We finished everything. Camille ordered their special Skirt Steak Mole with rice and beans and I had the Chuleta de Puerco -Grilled PorkChop with Caramelized onions, Yellow rice, Black beans and Tortillas. The origin of these unique Mexican dishes is obscure, but it's probably a very good guess that they are of mestizo (Spanish-Amerindian) inspiration, created out of he need to make a filling meal from whatever could be afforded and kept on hand.... tortillas, beans, rice, noodles..Like her music, Mexico's food is sometimes hot, sometimes sweet, sometimes a blending of both; but it is never dull.Although we were both full....and had no more space for a Postre (dessert) we capped our meal with an order of Pastel de Tres Leches . A fitting finale for an exciting cuisine.Camille won't stop talking about it on our way home...I have to shut her up.

So when Lan Zhou Handmade Noodles repeatedly was at the top of the most reviewed list, I knew I had to make the trip to the labyrinth that is Chinatown.Inconspicuous and neatly camouflaged against the bustling Chinatown backdrop, Lan Zhou is truly an indubitable hole in the wall.Small groups and single diners came in and out at a steady stream, slurping steaming bowls of hot hand-pulled noodle soups and scarfing down freshly crafted boiled and fried dumplings. My friend and I tried the oxtail noodle soup and the beef brisket noodle soup with an order of boiled dumplings and an order of fried dumplings. The noodles were perfectly al dente, doughy, and comforting. The broth was delightfully salty and savory (tons of MSG - my body will decompose nicely when I'm dead) and the portions were HUGE. I am not a light eater by any means and there was still a hefty pile of noodles in my bowl at the end of the meal. The dumplings were SO good. For lack of eloquency, all I can say is that they were the BOMB.COM. No soy sauce needed, my friends.So, two bowls of noodles, 2 orders of dumplings, one Diet Coke, and one regular Coke = $17.

1914,31,32,5.0,"From the moment I began writing reviews in New York, Clinton Street Baking Company was like a little wart that would never go away. I would see constant reminders in publications or reviews online or even casual questions posed my way in conversations regarding this place. It was an eventual item on my to-eat list, something that I knowingly would have tried even if it would take me 3 years. Upon first glance, the place seems hardly impressive. There is little seating for more than a group of 4 and corners tight enough to rub elbows with neighboring patrons. I ventured a look at the menu, which didn't have much as much variety as I would have expected in a place so popular. With such little space and a simple menu, is this kind of establishment really worth paying a premium for? Regardless of all of the negatives and disastrous maybes, there had to be a reason why people would wait so long to eat here. It couldn't be the trendiness as there was none and it wasn't the hipster vibe because its too expensive. I sucked it up, braved the 2 hour wait, and encouraged my appetite to try what many people have longed for every weekend.The foodgasm I encountered with every bite of my first experience was incredible. It was an impression that would not soon be forgotten and the type that is hard to shake off after months. This was unlike most brunches I've had, where the taste was impeccable and released all of my inhibitions to devour everything on my plate. Gone were the thoughts of eating healthy and raised my suspicions about how there must be crack in this delicious caramel, maple syrup. I am not a fan of pancakes but I couldn't stop eating the ones here. Surely the hashbrowns are not the shredded kind, but they're as wonderful as the fluffy eggs that I couldn't stop admiring. Even my pulp filled OJ was great and that says a lot.It has been several visits since and each time I have yet to leave disappointed. I've sampled everything from the Lobster BLT to the Southern Style Breakfast with a moan from each bite. It's true the prices don't merit a cheap brunch but in the end this place is worthy of at least one visit. I agree that a 2 hour wait is ridiculous, so I propose they buy out the empty Thai place next door and just knock down the wall. This way, the wait would be only 45 minutes at best.",37,0.9816
1915,20,14,5.0,"I love Di Palo's with a passion but the lines are sometimes unbearable!!!It is with this simple reason alone that I stumbled into Alleva located directly at the opposite end of the block.At first entry, the modestly decorated storefront and outside display windows of the establishment did not dictate the eye catching notoriety of its east end counterpart. Nevertheless, as most Italian cooks know, it's the quality of the product that dictates the integrity of business, not the glamour for which it's presented. The inside of the establishment is reflected directly by the store front. Do not expect any state of the art technology refrigerators nor focused lighting at this establishment. Alleva's interior is cascaded by bright white walls, which enhances the products of the establishment. Patrons will discover to their immediate left after entry, Italian cured meats ranging from Proscuitto (both di San Danielle & di Parma), and Sweet / Spicy Sopressata are on fully display for order. To the immediate right, patrons will be captivated by display of hand prepped Fresh Mozzarella, Sun Dried Tomatoes in Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Fresh Mozzarella Salad, and Olive Bar. At the center, imported Italian Extra Olive Oil as well as various types of pasta are available for purchase. The store itself is modest in size and displays each of their products well. Patrons will find that the setting of the establishment allows for a comfortable shopping experience.Granted, I only bought two items from Alleva but its still worth commenting...Fresh Mozzarella: At first glance, the textural and color composition of the Fresh Mozzarella is similar to that of any of the same kind. Of course, frequent users of this freshly packed cheese understand that despite the simplistic deception of visual perception, it is ultimately the substantial feel and taste of the product that dictates a well made Fresh Mozzarella. I proceeded to grab a Fresh Mozzarella Ball resembled that in size of one pound. The textural composition of the cheese is semi-firm, thus indicating that the cheese was prepped and packed by hand. Most mass produced Fresh Mozzarella is packed using machine compression to help alleviate the excess water in their product. Sadly, this process causes the texture of the Fresh Mozzarella to be excessively difficulty to eat due to imbalanced ratio of cheese to water. Luckily, the Fresh Mozzarella found at Alleva has the proper firmness and delicate texture required for such an application. During the initial tasting, it was evident that the aromatic scent and pure milky flavor / texture of the Fresh Mozzarella provided a cleansing to the palate. The proper balance of liquor to solids ratio in the application allowed for the taste of the cheese to flourish by having properties best described as being in ""melts in your mouth"" category. The delicate and soft texture of the cheese allowed for the fresh milk and earthy flavors to embody the taste buds, thus enhancing the purity of the product with each additional bite. Consumers will find that the Fresh Mozzarella at Alleva can be ranked as one of the freshest and best tasting they will find around Little Italy Manhattan.Sweet Sopressata: As with most cured meats, excessive amounts of salt applied during the curing process can produce both an eradication of the product as well as distaining the taste of that product with overwhelming saltiness. Luckily, the Sopressata available at Alleva did not attract either of these two qualities. The Sweet Sopressata was lightly cured, which produced a mild saltiness thus allowing for the various spices and texture of sausage to be abundantly present. The smooth texture of the sausage, derived directly from the abundance of fat, enhances the quality and textural composition of the meat. Biting into the Sopressata produces a profound joy in that the meat is delicate in texture yet brash in taste through the proper use of spices and execution during the creation and curing process. Consumers will find this particular Sopressata to be delicate and friendly to the palate, rather that than harsh and unwelcoming. In addition, the Sopressata was lightly more delicate in firmness than that of the many counterparts. I found this to be unique but welcoming as the application for which I am to use this meat required crumbling. The softness also greatly aided the taste of the Sopressata by allowed for the consumer to do less work during the consumption process. Each of the aspects observed from this cured meat were welcoming and profound.Two products and $11.15 cents later, a new discovery was had. Although Di Palo's has the notoriety through its newly acquired celebrity status, Alleva's simplicity in décor and extensive attention to detail and execution allows for its product to speak on its behalf. Frequent customers of Alleva's know that for first grade product, this is the establishment to visit.",23,0.9988

1919,20,21,5.0,"*Warning* This review is not going to be a hoity-toity gourmet praise kind with words like exquisite and delectable. Instead I'm going to really break it down for you and it might even come across as downright ghetto. Not gangsta or poor English like but I'll probably disgrace the chefs by really cheapening the food.It's my birthday today and all weekend I had been dreaming of knish, fro-yo, cookies, and pies. The Momofuku Bakery seemed to have all those things and I was really curious. If any baked good could taste as good as their pork bun, it would be a real winner. So I geared up, mentally prepared myself for the slush and cold, and went on a mission after work.The Momofuku Bar was practically empty. The whole take a number ticket was unnecessary and the people behind the counter were really nice and super chill. The place is simple. Bar tables, chalkboard menu, pay station, and hot food area. I was a little overwhelmed by the glass case. I had a plan this weekend and when I saw everything, my brain cells became confused. I asked for a sample of the graham soft serve. It was a hella big sample!!!! I'm not one to complain but after having the free taste, I was interested in the soft serve no more. Great consistency, horrible flavor. Too sweet! Euh. Not my thing. I'm such a Red Mango girl. Anyhow, the sweetness of the soft serve highlighted all the goo in the pies. This immediately out ruled things like the candy bar pie and crack. I went with the chocolate cake, compost cookie, and after glancing back up at the chalkboard menu, I added a volcano to my order.Hold up, $9 for a bun? This is where the argument of paying $4 for a cupcake can not hold a flame to paying $9 for a piece of bread. Aughhh. I hate how living in NY has created a standard of high $ = completely reasonable. I didn't bat an eye. I took my goodies to go but before I left, I took a peek at my volcano. Um, the thing was oozing of white stuff. I guess that's why they call it volcano. I was going home with a clam chowder bread bowl.Fast forward to home where I break into this volcano. I'm savage. I don't use utensils. The thing is cut in half. Thank God, because it is so damn big and after the pizza party at work today, I didn't think I had any more space for all the carbs. Just a taste.Arhgh argijsjg crunchg shsoisgo. Imagine all the rich comfort foods at your fingertips. Hot bread. Crusted cheese. Potato au gratin. Bacon. Caramelized onions. Alfredo. Yea you heard me! I just called the gruyere cheese alfredo sauce! Where's the linguini? Might as well throw some clams in there too while you're at it chef christina and marian. I'm so mean. I just insulted your haute bun. But it was amazing. The little ""snack"" turned into my din din and I just feasted on every fat rich comfort food memory I had stored in my tastebuds. On to the cookie, I call it the kitchen sink. It's got everything in it and it's so rich and buttery, savory and sweet. The next time I bake cookies, I'm gonna dust off my counters and pull all the junk out of the couch to serve as the secret ingredient. I'm sure cheetos and basil will make excellent accents. If you can do it with pretzels and potato chips, I surely can with orange doodles and herb remnants!And since it is my birthday, I did my best impression of Nigella Lawson by going into the kitchen in the dark, taking a fork and stabbing it into the cake. Forget hygiene and manners, take out and leftovers in the fridge were meant to be dug at and destroyed. I almost drank the milk out of the milk carton too, but the fat free milk was my roommate's.

We had reservations at 8:30 PM and were seated accordingly. The decor is very modern, urban, clean, and sleek. Dark woods, and unique ""Scandinavian-type"" furniture characterize this restaurant. My dining companion pointed out the most interesting design feature (or at least in my opinion) of the entire restaurant, the light fixtures on the walls. They gave the appearance of a chandelier, but they were really just a clear plastic of sorts that permitted light to shine through to create the illusion of a chandelier. Due to the inaugural weekend, some details still had yet to be ironed out with the service. The service was exceptional, but borderline overkill. At times some of the help was running around like chickens with their heads cut off. I would liken the awkwardness to the in between hug/kiss that you give a girl after a first date. You know, you both lean in, but you aren't drunk enough to put your lips on hers and you don't want her to think that you're a pig...err wait, no that never happens. We prompted our waitress for a dry white wine option, and she knocked it out of the park with her recommendation. The food was delicious. My ""besty"" and I shared an appetizer of mussels, which were quite good. I was expecting 3 mussels, because the place appeared to be quite upscale, but to my pleasant surprise it was a mountain o' mussels and they were delicious. We both decided on fish for dinner. She had the crusted halibut with broccoli and eggplant. I had the shrimp and scallops in a white wine and butter sauce, with white kidney beans. Both dishes were spectacular, marked by appropriate portions, exceptional flavoring, and perfect preparation.I can't take credit for choosing this place, because I'm hickish. Now I'm not saying I'm a hick, I'm just hickish when it comes to this type of dining. Luckily she has a refined taste and knows where to dine for special occasions.

1924,19,16,5.0,"I hesitate to write a review of da Bhang because I know that the inevitable crowdedness of a cafe like this is directly proportional to the number of positive Yelp reviews it receives (think Grounded).  But I'm simply too anal retentive not to include this in my Write Spot list...and I'm sure I'm going to pay for that bit of OCD in the end.Da Bhang is, indeed, an ideal place to get some work done. It's a great alternative when Grounded is too packed, which is almost always. During the day, it doesn't get terribly crowded so you can easily score a spot on the cushioned bank seating. The space is clean, sleek and modern and doesn't feel cramped or cluttered like some other cafes. I appreciate that they didn't feel compelled to squeeze in as many tables as they could just to utilize the minimal space. I have been in larger cafes that feel smaller due to this.There isn't a whole lot of natural lighting since it's lower than street level and goes deep rather than wide, but if you sit by the giant window in the front, you'll be fine. The lighting further in is actually pretty good, and probably helped by the light wall color. The bathroom is well maintained and wheelchair-accessible, although the cafe itself isn't. They tend to play soothing jazz music that's not too distracting, although the whiff of waffles cooking is. I'd take that tempting scent any day over coffee brewing since I don't drink the stuff (as a bonus, you won't smell like coffee for the rest of the day). The turkey and brie sandwich I ordered seemed pricey at $7.50, but since they panini press it for you and include a salad, it's not a bad deal. And if you're a student, you can take advantage of a 10% discount.The vibe changes a bit after 7pm, when the lights get dimmer and it starts to get busier with the dinner crowd. I wouldn't think to eat dinner here since they have more of a lunch menu (with the exception of bi bim bap), but I guess people like indulging in waffles in the evening. I was surprised to see how it went from writing spot to hot spot once the sun came down. But the vibe/crowd change lets me know that I've already spent several hours there and it's time to head home. Luckily, the staff is very friendly and doesn't seem to mind table squatters like myself.In short, da Bhang is da bomb. (Sorry, I couldn't resist.)",19,0.9958

Don't panic when i say pricey im not talking outrageously doing-the-dishes-in-the-back-alley pricey. check out the menu onlinep.s. Tasting menu (around 50Bucks i believe) is a pretty good deal.

There was another kosher deli closer to where I lived, but that closed down.Ben's is a relic. A tribute to a time before we cared about being fat, or heart disease, or dying young. As my grandmother told me ""your great-grandfather dug his own grave with a knife and fork"". Places like Ben's provide the shovel.I have an aunt who still lives in Forest Hills. I took her here two Saturdays ago for her 98th birthday. As all kosher delis do, they start you out with a plate of pickles and coleslaw. The food here is standard kosher deli chow and we all ordered pretty much the same thing. In front of me was a mountainous sandwich. To be more accurate it was a thin slice of rye with four inches of pastrami, covered with another thin slice of rye. To this I add a swirl of mustard. If you are thinking ""mayo would be great on that"", please meet me at Port Authority bus station and I will gladly buy you a one-way ticket back to Ohio. The pastrami was excellent. I was actually surprised, expecting it to just be mediocre. It was lean but not dry and tender not rubbery. We also ordered some french fries which were large, but tasty, hunks of fried potato. To wash it down I got my grandfathers favorite, Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray soda. That is a celery flavored soda. No, it's not gross.

1938,21,14,5.0,"For my recent birthday, two good friends took me to dinner, and had made reservations at what we believed was going to be Samba-Le. Turns out that Samba-Le is no more, and has been supplanted by a new restaurant called Yerba Buena (meaning ""good herb"" -- one can only surmise what was behind that naming decision. Ha!). Whereas Samba-Le was apparently some mix of Italian and Brazilian, Yerba Buena lands solidly in the Latin American category, with a Cuban influence.Despite walking in and being slightly mystified, we were soon pleasantly surprised by all aspects of this new restaurant which, according to our super accommodating maitre'd Giovanni, has only been open a week.My friend and I sat at the bar waiting for our third dinner companion, and partook of some extremely tasty (not to mention enthusiastically crafted) mojitos. Upon learning that we were celebrating my birthday, Giovanni informed us that he was going to make sure we had an extremely special evening, and indeed it was. When our remaining companion arrived and we were seated, Giovanni brought out a bottle of kava for us to share, on the house.The service, overall, was superior. It was attentive but unobtrusive, sophisticated but friendly and unhurried; our glasses were never low for more than 30 seconds before they were being refilled. For appetizers we had a red snapper ceviche which was prepared with lime and cilantro, and prawns that were topped with chopped sauteed garlic and seasoning. Both were excellent; the ceviche flavorful and tangy, and the prawns tender and juicy.For the main course two of us had the ""Ropa Vieja"" (which means ""old clothes""), which is a shredded preparation of beef with ""patacones"" which are fried plantains. The meat was succulent and juicy and prepared just right, and the plantains were crispy, warm and delicious. My other companion had the Roasted Suckling Pig (which also came shredded), also with plantains and mojo (which was good, since this friend said he had been trying to get his mojo back for quite awhile). The taste I had of the pork was delicious as well, and I'd go back just to have that next time, but both dishes were quite delicious and satisfying.The evening was capped off with desert and a preliminary port tasting consisting of Fonseca Bin 27, a Dow I can't remember the variety of, and one other that was fairly sweet, the name of which also escapes me. We chose the Dow, and decided to split the Churros dessert, which came drizzled with caramel, vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce for dipping. They were absolutely fantastico. It was delivered with a candle and a song, which made it even more special. Giovanni also generously delivered two more desserts on the house, one of which was a very subtly sweet rice pudding, that was definitely noteworthy.Prices are not super cheap, with main courses in the mid-twenties, but I would say that for the quality of the food and service, it was really quite a bargain. The atmosphere and decor are sophisticated but festive, and they play a mixture of latin and that lounge music that seems inescapable in New York City. I happen to like it, so for me it was all good.I would highly recommend Yerba Buena, and I would also highly recommend Giovanni as a maitre'd. He's very knowledgeable and has just the right touch with overseeing service. Dinner was a fabulous experience from start to finish.",22,0.9991

I'm going to skip the play-by-play, since 1. it's all a blur; I can't remember more than five courses for months and months unless I take notes. 2. the menu changes so often that you might as well let go and remain at the mercy of the fabulous, open-faced kitchen! The bar-style seating is really unique, and given the choice, I always sit at the bar, whether at all sushi restaurants or even something more low-key, like Soba-ya. Gives the opportunity for watching everything having to do with my food. At L'Atelier, my eyes wandered as I gave other diners' dishes the up-and-down.Plus, we had a lovely time meeting the couple next to us. She was my birthday twin. I wasn't going to raise my hand and demand a birthday goody, but I saw that she got one. We delighted over sharing birthdays; the server overheard, and lo and behold, one just like hers appeared before me, lit candle and all. Wasn't going to resist. No complaints on the service.As compared to, say, Per Se, where each course came out richer and heavier and richer until my heart hurt (no doubt Keller's flawless execution, but by mid-meal, I was so stuffed I could not look covetously at the tray of ow...homemade chocolates...ow...in flavors like pistachio...cry...and truffle...and we mean the fungus), the portions here were perfect. No heartache nor stomachache here. Plus, my Pardner and I split one wine-tasting to preempt that feeling. (Great idea! Max utility! Reins the bill into the lower stratosphere, too!) I had a feeling that L'Atelier was going to be a yes yes yes! when compared to its peers, if only for its seamless and thoughtful integration of Japanese elements (yuzu, more seafood, fruitier desserts) into French cuisine. (With Daniel, Jean-Georges, etc. -- oh, the near-disgusting number of options at every level in this city -- how is one to choose her next odyssey???) I am partial to subtler flavors and less butter, salt and meat, especially if there is going to be a parade of courses.Finally, watch out! Get the correct address, because there is apparently another Four Seasons not too far away which we find ourselves wandering about in before we arrived at the right hotel a bit late and hungrier for our res. For the future, I'm now lusting after the langoustine carpaccio, which some other reviewers have talked about. Ooh, bet that's good, too.

I met up with the inimitable Sadie S in the Shake Shack line at 2:30, and we began to wait. At 3:30, we had our burgers.Now, in general, I don't like waiting for food. I live next door to Grimaldi's and always scoff at the suckers spending their entire Saturday in line in the rain and cold waiting for pizza that I don't even think is that good. So why would a line-snob like me spend an hour waiting for something as basic as a burger? Is it:a) I am a hype whore.

My stomach was growling, but the time went by relatively quickly and at the end of it all, I had a delicious Shack Burger in my hands, and those hands were stuffing my face as fast as they could. Best burger in the city? I don't think so--I still prefer Dumont. But for a fast-food, medium-temperature burger, it was fantastic--juicy, flavorful and fresh. The bun was nicely grilled on the inside too, and the ""special sauce"", whatever it was, was delish.  Crinkle-cut fries (which I don't normally like) were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, surprisingly good! And my B&W milkshake was creamy and perfect.One lesson learned, however--if you happen to show up when ""Rosey Rhubarb"" is the Shake of the Day, AVOID. It tasted like a mouthful of creamy roses. Actually, let me re-phrase that--if a mouthful of creamy roses sounds to you like the perfect complement to a burger and fries, go right ahead and order the Rosey Rhubarb shake. If not, stick with the standards. Obviously, it takes patience, a flexible work schedule and some comfortable shoes in order to enjoy Shake Shack.

The complaints of other Yelpers only proves this fact more, and in essence also proves why this place is amazing.1. We English love to queue. It's one of our more beloved national pasttimes. We queue for anything really. We feel more comfortable in a queue. Asking us to queue for a spot of tea is not unheard of. Not even in bad weather. We'd queue up outside regardless, even if the establishment had a capacity of 1,000. Since this is an English run business, you're pretty much expected to queue.2. We're not exactly known for our native cuisine, are we? Let's face it, most of our native food is bland and canned. Serving tinned Heinz beans on toast is EXACTLY what we're craving. Since it's almost always more expensive to get authentic tinned Heinz baked beans in bodegas and shops, it's well worth the much cheaper $3.25 side dish at T&S.3. We're also not exactly known for our politeness, are we? I've never heard of an American tourist coming to our country and remarking on how wonderfully nice we are. It's quite the opposite, innit?In addition to the above, the food is fresh and delicious and as I mentioned, authentic. Real un-pre-sliced bread, real thick cream cheese (not the processed spreads), hearty and strong teas. My favourite is the vanilla mint. Its aroma can clear even the toughest of sinuses. Good for year round - as it can surpress summer allergies and winter colds alike. Too hot out? Get it iced and to go. The place is tiny so do expect to queue and get moved about even after being seated. But please remain calm and refrain from bickering with your fellow patrons. You're going to have to sit pretty close to them for the duration of your meal. I don't know about you, but I can't enjoy my tea with someone looking to start a row behind me. Turnover in the place on busy days is still pretty swift, so be courteous, mimic our stiff upper lip, and let someone go before you. You'll be seated soon enough, and without added aggravation.",13,0.9845
1949,23,18,5.0,"Pho So Mot (1) is like a breath of fresh air in the lacking Vietnamese options in the city. It just happens to be tucked away in the back of Mott Street in a basement that often goes unnoticed. That may be its one lacking fault, as many restaurants have gone the way of the dinosaur here (Lucky 11 or the dreaded So Go, even the cheapo Hing Long) and hopefully this place will continue to thrive.The restaurant is small but quaint. Unlike the previous establishments, Pho So Mot is clean and has created enough space for big groups with some actual round tables. Often times they'll have a flat screen TV playing Vietnamese / Chinese programs, drowning out most of the quiet ambiance. On a whole, the service is real decent and the owner is friendly. Like most other Vietnamese restaurants, the staff speaks both Chinese and Vietnamese.The food is most definitely quality and there is plenty of variety on the menu. I am impressed with their Bun Dac Biet and especially their Pho. The broth was fresh as it was tasty and the noodles were just perfect. Another dish that look extra impressive was the Com Tam Suon Bi Cha, which was presented quite well. Prices are also very good as most of the items are $10 and below. There is so much more here that I would like to try, it's practically a guarantee I'll be back again and again. Right now, they're holding a grand opening special in which everything is 10% off. I am sure that will be there till the end of the year at least.They are definitely So Mot (No.1) in my book. Cam on Pho So Mot! (Thank you Pho So 1).",30,0.9966

Lucky for those select few that can't get enough of my writing, I've taken Viagra, so even if the moment isn't right, I can still write. I had to review Public & Double Crown in the same day because they're practically kissing cousins. Public has quite the cult following. It's well deserved. This place succeeds where many others fail miserably. It has the trendy vibe that make the young, hip, wealthy, and overextended want to be seen there, but it also backs it up with a relaxed environment to drink and very solid food options. Much like its kin, Double Crown - some design/decor thought clearly went into the space as evidenced by every detail down to the light fixtures. My favorite part of this place is the marketing genius that is on display in the restroom. They offer soap packaged with the Public logo. Think about it as if it were a business card with soap. Brilliant. You can guarantee I took two bars home with me. The trout was very solid, but fell short of gourmet. What the restaurant lacks in ""cooking chops"" it makes up in ""vibe."" Much like Double Crown the service is spot on, which only enhances the experience. Many of these trendy places have an attitude that screams indifference towards the customers, but these people have been well trained to ensure that Public isn't resting on its reputation, but that everyone is working to raise the bar. Again, Erica is great. If you happen to go here based on this recommendation please tell her Chris ""Pizza"" J. aka Chelsea Clinton's boyfriend told you to say hello. Leave her a big tip too, because everyone knows you're a baller and she deserves it.

Momofuku Ko is a unique dining experience with some massive hits and a few flavor combinations that had my head scratching, but I would recommend anyone that has been discouraged by the reservation system to keep trying (specifically on a sunday morning at EXACTLY 9:59am to easily reserve a Saturday night spot).A few complaints however:1. The reservations system. I know I know, it's been talked about to death but it was seriously annoying checking for reservations EVERY day for weeks. Hopefully as everyone eats there it will become easier and easier to get a table.2. For a restaurant that is ALL ABOUT THE CHEF'S, Momofuku's chefs are uncomfortably aloof to the diners. Working there seems to be like a chef vacation where every dish takes about 3 seconds to prepare and you only do about 30 covers a night. Most of the time I was there the chefs were standing around bored and it was painful to try to get them to converse with you. I'm not saying it should take immense amount of work to put together a dish with fire flying around the kitchen, it just seems like the menu at Ko hasn't changed in weeks and mise en place arranged on the plate is almost the entire meal.3. David Chang wasn't there...I'm not a fanboy but when you're dropping $200 per person to sit at a bar on a Saturday night, you don't want to see the 2nd string chefs!

They have special sauces and wonderful waffle and sweet potato fries ($3 for a take-out container full). I like it because they use paper plates and take-out containers to hold their yummies- eliminating any crusty plateware issues at other busy HH joints. They also have huge plastic tubes (think: hydrants) of beer to share. Perfect for a group gathering.The $2 beers come in HUGE glass mugs and they have everything from bud to stella to a wonderful blue-moon like ""Shock"".

I am a sucker for Italian hospitality and enjoy the *really* awesome homemade soup handed to me. After this sample, I am offered a cauliflower fritter which is equally delicious and, I fear, addictive. Next we talk pizza. I am promised that the spinach and artichoke will blow my mind. At this point, I feel a challenge coming on. I put down my enormous gym bag and realize that my sense of self discipline has little power over pizza. No working out for this girl tonight...it's throw down pizza time with the new kid on the block.The verdict? If you like spinach, artichoke, and cheese dip with rustic slightly crispy crust...you will like this slice. If you love a LOT of said ingredients, you will LOVE this slice. It's enormous. I've never tasted anything quite like it. It is very heavy so watch out, you might need some backup. I could not finish it alone. I also tried a taste of their regular (Neopolitan) pizza. What stuck out to me most of all was the refreshing tomato sauce. Normally I am a ""light on the sauce, please"" kind of girl but I wouldn't change a thing here. This is my new place to grab a fresh slice. I don't know what it is, but they do it right. In my time chatting with the owners, so many people came in and out getting slices.

1963,17,6,5.0,"OK, where do I start. First of all, if you're going to enjoy this place, you've got to be in a certain mindset. Don't go expecting to be king of the world, because you're not. The rice is. Don't go expecting to fill yourself up. Depending on your budget, and how you order, you very well might leave hungry. But that's ok. Because you're gonna have a great time, and what's wrong with a little ramen after dinner anyway? Basically, go in there the first time with the mindset that you're going to a very serious/fine dining sort of place, because that's what it is. Afterwards you can decide that it's the kind of place you'll want to make your regular sushi place, but won't be able to afford to. Expect to be humbled.OK, so here are some pointers for first timers:1) Make a reservation to sit at the sushi bar at the very least, and sit in front of the man, Mr. Yasuda if your date/time is flexible. The core of the place is in front of Mr. Yasuda, and at the sushi bar in general. That's what you're coming for. More on Mr. Yasuda later. 2) It's easy to be intimidated, but don't worry about it. Ordering at the beginning was the hardest part, but even if you make a misstep, it's ok. Mr. Yasuda will forgive you. I've read so many different things about how to order and costs and everything, I thought I had it figured out. No, I didn't. But it's really simple. For the first time, take it piecemeal. (3) Get the basic set to start, which is like less than $20 and has 8 nigiri and a half tuna-roll (which my friend said was the best tekka-maki he ever had. I agree.) This is what he'll suggest, just to get the ball rolling. He'll ask you what you don't eat. Tell him. Then he'll give you the nigiri, one by one. It will be awesome. Don't bother with soy sauce, or anything else for that matter. He's already seasoned it for you. Pay attention to the rice. Remember what I said about you not being king of the world? You're not it. But you'll start to feel like it as the meal goes on. 3) After the set is over, start looking at the list the waiters gave you at the beginning, with suggestions for that day marked in red. Start thinking of what looks good to you. Then have the chef choose 4 or 5 more nigiri for you. That's what omakase means: ""you decide."" It's not a pre-fixe menu. It's whatever the chef thinks is good, and thinks that you'll like. The sushi experience is all about the interaction between you and the sushi chef, and about you trusting him to make you happy. One of two things will happen. Either he'll pick what you were looking at, in which case you'll be amazed at his mind-reading abilities (this happened to us), or he'll pick something totally different. Either way, it's going to be good. Even if you don't think you like sea urchin roe, if he utters the word uni, you say ""yes, please."" Same goes for eel.4) At this point it's up to you. You can ask for suggestions, you can ask him for specific things, you can ask him to choose. Whatever. At this point, you can keep going until it feels right to stop. You'll be having a grand-old time with the chef at this point, so he'll know what you like, but if something catches your eye, don't be afraid to ask for it. 5) A cool thing about the list that's in front of you. You'll always know how much each piece is, so you can keep an eye on your budget. The most expensive pieces are the different kinds (!) of toro, obviously, at $7 each. Rolls are a little more expensive, but you're not gonna go and have 5 of those at a time. Uni and other pieces are around $5.6) About Mr. Yasuda: He's a character. Very nice, but can be a little intimidating at first. Don't worry about it. He's a talker. He'll talk a ton about his whole style, about rice, about where the fish comes from, about what sucks about most japanese restaurants, and why he's doing what he's doing. As my friend said, he's a man on a mission: to make his way of sushi, the standard way of sushi. According to him, his way isn't special, just the way its supposed to be. Sometimes it can be hard to understand every word, but just smile and nod, and it'll be fine. Oh, and another thing. He's a smart-ass. Seriously. He spent a good amount of time during the course of the meal busting my balls, but it was all in good fun. I wouldn't recommend this place for a date, for a few reasons. First of all, the focus isn't on the two of you, it's on the food, the chef, and you, and the interaction among them. Secondly, there's the budget thing. Any urge to impress can lead to a skyrocketing bill, and even more if you have appetizers or drinks. Ok, that's all Yelp will let me write. If you love sushi the way it was meant to be, and are prepared to humble yourself, Sushi Yasuda is the way to go.",24,0.9987

Everything was absolutely perfect. Calling the food ""Delicious"" felt like an understatement. ""Nice"" would have been such a plain description. McDonald's can be described as nice and to call Per Se the same would just be downright offensive. To describe the food with such mediocre terms, I would be a disgrace to fellow Foodies the world over.So back to the book, it'll be formatted with one word per page. It will and should be brought to Per Se for a meal. As every course is brought out, the reader/diner will open the book to a random page and the word will accurately describe their dish.

Outstanding. Terrific. Fantastic. Wonderful. Fabulous. Superb. Heavenly. Of course there'll be slang words! Tight. Legit. Money. Legal. ill. Shiznit (ie. This Salmon with Creme Fraiche amuse bouche is the shiznit!)I'm still taking submissions for words. After all the words there'll be mini chapters such as..1) ""If you ask nicely, they will give it to you"" to describe the service and how much they go out of their way to please you (ie. asking for a second helping of amuse bouches and a second round of chocolate)2) ""if you tell them that you're there for a special occasion, they print personalized menus for you and your dining party."" Another important chapter will be dedicated to the difference between spring and fall flavors. With the Fall flavors being all about truffles, risotto, heavier sauces and meats and the Spring being lighter with a lot of fish and poultry. (Though of course this definitely could change as Per Se's menu changes daily, to be covered in the chapter called ""It's different every time."")I haven't yet decided if there'll be a section for medicore words like Nice, Delicious and Good. I might put it in for the people that were unimpressed by the food. If this chapter will be in my book though, it'll be all the way in the back as the spotlight of the book is how truly amazing Per Se is.

The next twenty minutes were spent watching Mr. Demarco meticulously prepare our pizza from the initial sprinkling of the cheese to its final christening with olive oil Now, I have to admit that after eating my first piece, I began to doubt Di Fara's reputation -- having spent a week last year in Italy eating pizza almost everyday for lunch as well as taking a local pilgrimage to Grimaldi's, my pizza standards were pretty high.  It was definitely good, but not the level of awesomeness i was expecting.Meanwhile, my boyfriend sat across the table in pure pizza ecstasy. Was my palate off? Were my standards unreasonable? I reached for second piece and suddenly my doubt was erased and I joined my boyfriend in pizza heaven.How could two slices of the same pizza taste so vastly different? In my eyes, Mr. DeMarco is the Jackson Pollack of pizza. Some areas of his canvas get pools of olive oil, some get a sprinkle. Some get an extra slice basil, while others are left wanting more. While I am firm believer that you can never have too much olive oil, cheese or basil..... I would happily risk getting a four-star slice at DiFara's if it is followed by a heavenly six star",12,0.9485
1968,20,25,5.0,"This review is based 90% on the burger. I know. Get over it.THE QUEST FOR BURGACIOUSNESS**: CHAPTER 7GENESIS: 1.77. And on the thirteenth DAYYYYYYyyyyYYY (no, the LAWWWD is not superstitious, you DoWarK) .... the LAWWD was checking out NYU coeds when he created... COZY SOUP & BURGER (""burguesa,"" for you international types). He was feeling rather ""cozy"" that day, and besides, sometimes a cup of soup is just what's needed on a cold, winter day... BUT THIS WAS JUNE (days go by so fast when the LAWWWD is creating stuff, no?... but I digress).The LAWWD tasted what's known as the ""Reuben Burger"" (of his own invention, of course); that it tasted good. DAYUM good, in fact, as to be considered completely BURGACIOUS*. And it was morning, and it was evening on that burgacious* thirteenth day.When I lived in Boston, there was this place in Harvard Square called ""Mr. Bartley's Burger Cottage,"" which I just found out is still in existence. All the burgers at Mr. Bartley's were PRETTY DANG BURGACIOUS*, but there was one in particular that was, in my view, a cut above the rest: the Reuben Burger. It was a fairly simple if not completely intuitive combination; a burguesa of the burgacious variety, combined with swiss cheese, russian dressing and, of all things, sauerkraut. Sounds weird, I know, but IT IS SERIOUSLY TASTY. I was ""hipped"" to this here burger by a friend of mine during my tenure at the famed Coffee Connection, also in Harvard Square. One late night, while doing the grind in the ""saliva pits,"" (as we lovingly referred to the dishwashing machine at CC), I took a break in the office and my friend offered me a bite of his Reuben burger, which I accepted and...AHhhhhhhH HAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaHHHH (angels signing)Tweet tweet, chirp chirp (birds tweeting/chirping)I was summarily BLINDED by shafts of light, whereupon (now, I can't be completely sure of this but...) the LAWWWWWD spoke to me and said, ""Yes, my son, that is a VERY SPECIAL BURGUESA YOU HAVE YOUR MITTS ON!""He was right. It was... special (and not that ""short bus"" kind of special). From then on, I was completely hooked on the Reuben Burger (or Burguesa de Reuben for you international types).I searched every restaurant in NY looking for a comparable burger, but I was unable to do so. Most places that serve burgers do not carry sauerkraut, so it was IMPOSSIBLE to have even a rough semblence of this burgalicious delicacy.Enter Cozy Soup & Burger. YES.Me: Um. Do you have... SAUERKRAUT?Waiter: YesMe (once I got over the shock): Do you have... RUSSIAN DRESSING?!?Waiter: YesMe: Now... work with me here... can you give me a swiss cheeseburger with sauerkraut on it and russian dressing?Waiter: Sure, no problem!Me: *THUD* (fainting... it was all a little too much for my delicate constitution to handle all the excitement)Well, the ensuing burger experience was first rate.

That was actually commandment number 11 (a much overlooked commandment).Here are some more commandments:12. GO to Cozy Soup & Burger13. ORDER a Reuben Burger (not by name, but by ingredient)14.

1969,52,50,5.0,"Over the years, I have begun to see the value of specialization over well-roundedness. Take the case of Levain, the small downstairs bakery in a classic UWS block. You might say that Levain has a wide range of products. Baguettes, loaves of bread, sandwiches and even pizzas. And pastry products, including brioches, scones and muffins. However, they are best known for their specialization in cookies. Well-rounded, almost hemispherical creations that are fashionably out of shape and inconsistent in their appearance.The cookies come in four flavors, with the chocolate chip walnut likely being the most popular. Other flavors include dark chocolate chip and dark chocolate peanut butter. I prefer the oatmeal raisin cookie. This jumbo cookie is loaded with plump raisins and is crispy on the outside while being extremely soft in the center. The dark chocolate ones have an overpowering taste of chocolate. Each cookie tips the scales at an impressive half a pound (sic) and is priced at $3.75.You can smell Levain''s cookies from fifty feet away and, if you are not sold on their aroma, you will fall for their buttery richness.

1970,33,36,5.0,"If I can think of one grievance against Gramercy Tavern, it would be that throughout the dinner, my date was fawning more over the restaurant than over me. And despite my (unwarranted) large ego and jealousy to match a particular god of the Old Testament, I have forgiven my date for such a grave offense. Because, all jokes aside, Gramercy Tavern not only matched our high expectations, it exceeded them in its perfect execution and flawless delivery of all aspects of the dining experience.As with Jean Georges and Nougatine, Gramercy Tavern offers two dining experiences-- the tavern and the dining room. Each has its own space, unique decor, individualized menu, and a different price tag. Closer to the entrance of the restaurant and encompassing the bar, the tavern is the more casual side of the restaurant. Decorated with colorful contemporary paintings of fruits and vegetables, the tavern is charmingly lively and fun. Although the date and I only stayed at the tavern for drinks, I actually much more enjoyed the atmosphere here than in the dining room.The cocktails that we had at the bar were absolutely superb. I ordered the Orange Blossom (sparkling wine, elderflower, orange bitters) and the date got Peach Basil Fizz (bourbon, peaches, basil, soda), but ended up switching drinks with the date partly because I ended up enjoying his drink more and partly because I kept teasing him of how masculine he looked with a champagne flute. For both drinks, they were subtle and delicious. The date also later got the Tradewind (rum, cucumber, ginger, lime) which was spicy and refreshing.With dimmer lights and a quieter crowd, the dining room is the elegant and intimate counterweight to the lively and casual tavern. The charming grace of the dining room is derived from its subtlety. Unlike the other famed colonial themed restaurant, One if By Land Two if By Sea, Gramercy Tavern doesn't capitalize on the antique decorations to a point of garishness. Rather, the restaurant decor is a tasteful balance of modern and colonial that serves as a visual representation of the restaurant's culinary philosophy.Simply stated, the dinner was absolutely amazing.Since both the date and I preferred the larger selection of options form the dinner menu than the tasting menus, we ended up getting the $82 dinner menus rather than the season tasting menu or the vegetarian tasting menu. For the first course, I ordered the veal cappelletti, and the date ordered the black tagliatelle. For the main course, I ordered the smoked lobster while my companion got the rack of pork and braised belly.With all the dishes, I was floored by how meticulously thought out and exquisitely prepared everything was. Though gracefully subtle, the flavors were by no means lacking. Each ingredient played off another so well to bring out the most in its flavor and texture. As for my veal cappelletti, the veal was so tender, I'd describe it as being soft as velvet. The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce was light and really brought out the flavors of the veal. The lobster entree was, without any competition, the best lobster I've ever had. Tack on any appetizing adjective applicable to a crustacean dish, because the lobster here really was perfect.And the desserts! *swoon* I ordered the Grand Marnier Mascarpone Cheesecake (Gentlemen, let's get serious. Mascarpone cheesecake is a fail proof dessert on it's own, but if you add Grand Marnier into the mix, the end result is what I'd call [if I may be so lewd] the panty-dropper of sweets. Learn to make it.) while my date got the chocolate bread pudding. The cheesecake was phenomenal (soft, sweet, flavorful), and I really loved the brittle with which it came (crispy, crunchy, lasting caramelized sugar taste that reminds me of the white grandmother I imagined having). The only thing not orgasmic was the lemon-raspberry sorbet, which was just fine. I've never been a big fan of bread pudding so I didn't steal my date's food as I've been shamelessly doing all night (all in the name of research, I swear!), but the ice cream that came along was absolutely divine.Throughout the night, the service was impeccable. The servers were not only polite, knowledgeable, helpful, but they were also very well versed in the art of short polite conversations armed with rapid wit.Of course, not everything was perfect. The upholstery looks like those of a dentist from the 1990s. And I also found an eyelash in my dessert. But since I did get another dish with apologies, and since the ordeal was handled with commendable courtesy, I can't find much else to complain. Gramercy Tavern absolutely delivered.And seriously speaking, I can't be mad at my date. I mean, shoot, I'm fawning more over Gramercy Tavern than over him. Hell, I'm so in love with this place, if I ever make those silly ""5 people I'm allowed to sleep with"" list, I'm adding Gramercy Tavern onto the it. Right after Eric Bana.",33,0.9984

The old grandpa's who run this time-warped coffee house are interesting characters. Also, the Filipinos who grocery shop in Chinatown all seem to know of Mei Lai Wah's pork buns, so if you arrive after them, be prepared to wait for the next batch to be cooked because these Filipino families buy them in mass quantities (I figure they throw them in the freezer at home, or else how can you eat that many?).",8,0.9939

1975,19,16,5.0,"This is the closest 5 star, classier restaurant near me and I must say I am very pleased by its addition to the somewhat sleazy few blocks I reside within. I'd actually give this place 4.5 stars but I'm rounding up for nearly uniformly amazing quality of food, perfect service, and a fabulous wine list. The only flaws are prices - this place isn't cheap and the portions are on the small side, though still satisfying sized - and the bread (European white crusty rolls and olive focaccia-style twisty bread) that is served is at best, mediocre. They also do not have a hard liquor license.Fortunately the large but not overwhelming and very excellent wine list makes up for the lack of other booze, and they do offer prosecco and sake based cocktails and a few types of sangria; my lovely dining partner Rebecca H got the apricot mint sparkling cocktail and it was tasty and fresh. I opted for wine, and their two roses by the glass ($10 each) - a grenache from France, a merlot from Spain - both sounded so appealing and the erudite sommelier and I got into quite a discussion about roses. He offered to give me a half glass of each for the price of one glass, and they were generous pours. The Grenache was palest pink, light, strawberries and a hint of sparkle and good minerality, very crisp. The Merlot was deeply coloured, almost red, rich, ripely fruity, and also vaguely sparkling. Both were the best roses I've had in at least a year, but the Merlot in particular blew my mind, and we ended up getting a bottle of it.Meanwhile I munched on the crusty but not particularly flavourful white roll and the flavourful but dry and rather stale olive bread, which at least gained some points when dipped into the dish of delightfully green and fruity extra virgin olive oil. I considered consuming the EVOO straight, in fact, but refrained for reasons of dignity.Rebecca and I split an appetiser of the heirloom tomato crostini ($12), which thoroughly impressed us both and arrived swiftly. Medium-sized for an app, large wedges of firm but ripe yellow-green heirloom tomatoes and halved, almost candy-sweet red cherry tomatoes topped and cascaded over a long rectangle of olive-oil drenched crisped white bread. A light pesto-olive oil sauce brought all the flavours and textures together in perfect harmony. I only wish there had been more than 3 tiny leaves of rocket.Next came Rebecca's marinated hanger steak ($27) which was cooked just as requested - medium-rare, nicely pink, tender and flavourful, with a chimichurri sauce our server claimed contained cilantro but which I can gratefully vouch did not. It was pure lemony-herbal goodness. I did not try the sauteed chard, which appeared fresh and gently cooked, or the fingerling potatoes with cheesy topping, which looked scrumptious but were rather underrepresented, but the speed which with Rebecca devoured these sides convinced me they must have been damn good.My own spice crusted lamb ($29) was excellent - two thick rib chops, which doesn't sound like much but these were hefty and free of gristle and quite lean, again perfectly cooked to a juicy medium rare, and nicely seasoned with cumin and other middle eastern spices. I've never had anything quite like the fried hummus side, a decent-sized round of dense, moist but with a delicately fried, slightly crunchy exterior - but it reminded me of fried polenta, and it complemented the lamb well.The sweet and tangy fruit sauce (berries? apricots?) was just enough to balance the flavours of the lamb and hummus, much as the flavours were so lightly yet fully harmonised in the steak dish. My one peeve was that the fairly generous portion of sugar snap peas were not snap peas but instead some very fine green beans, almost haricots verts, sauteed in oil till green and crisp. I enjoyed them, but on principle I dislike substitution without forewarning.Amazingly I was quite satisfied by the food, thus my belief that the portions, though not American-sized, were not exactly bird food either. Still, I badly wanted to try the goat cheesecake with lavender honey ($9), and Rebecca decided to go for a sweet Riesling as a dessert wine. Her wine was delicious, fruity and sweet but still crisp, not cloying. My surprisingly large dessert was good, but not amazing. I honestly couldn't taste the goat cheese, and the sauce was NOT lavender honey but instead a sort of wild blueberry and honey compote, which was tasty but again NOT WHAT IT SAID ON THE MENU. And the lack of goat flavour distressed me greatly.The interior is lovely and sleek and modern, and the service was fast, attentive but not pushy, courteous and friendly. I liked that there was more light than in so many dimly-lit NY restaurants, but not so much that it was glaring. Our total came to nearly $100/person including tip, which is not cheap, but my experience was fabulous enough to just barely warrant it, at least once.BEER & WINE ONLY.

1980,10,8,5.0,"Cognitive Dissonance.According to Britannica.com, this psychological phenomenon is ""the mental conflict that occurs when beliefs or assumptions are contradicted by new information.""I had spent several weeks eagerly clicking the Momofuku website at 9:59:50 to login to try to score a reservation - they say this place is harder to book than Per Se. David Chang is being lauded as the best new chef this side of Hester Blumenthal or Ferran Adria (ok, I'm exaggerating, but only a little). Surely this means I could not give Ko anything less than five stars, could I??? Well, I copped out and gave it five stars, but it was close.Others have already described the decor, so no need to belabor that.  I went with a female friend, and, as others have also mentioned, we were served different things on a least a few courses. We noticed that there were two other pairs eating at the same time, and the man received the same dishes I did, while the woman received the same food as my friend. However, the last group consisted of two girls, and one of them was served the same food I was, so I don't think it's completely by gender. I think they do try to give a group of people a variety. In addition to the food, you can pick from a $50, $85, or $150 (!!!) drink tasting menu. I was going to go for the $50, but my friend talked me into splitting the $150, asking me ""When do you think you'll come next???""I thought the first 1/2 of the meal was underwhelming. The biggest disappointments: Spiced chicharron (aka pork rind) - After hearing so much about this, I was sorely disappointed. The rind was too subtle (read: bland). I honestly would rather have eaten pork rinds from a bag, or, as my friend put it, good ol' Chinese style shrimp chips are better.Kim chee consomme with pork belly and raw oyster - The consomme is a latter-day version of kimchee chigae, and I have to say this was the most disappointing dish, because i had looked forward to it the most. Neither the broth nor the pork had much flavor, and the oysters were not enough to save the day. Other dishes that were bland were the chawan mushi with asparagus, pea soup with crawfish, and halibut. So how the heck can I justify giving them five stars? Because of the last 4 dishes:The shaved foie gras torchon - You know when you eat flavored shaved ice desserts, such as those at Vietnamese or Korean restaurants? When you put a spoonful in your mouth, all the shaved ice melts together into once mass, and then you taste the intense sweetness of the azuki bean or condensed milk? This is the same, except better - you put a big bite of shaved foie gras in your mouth, just experiencing the powdery texture, but not the taste yet. Then it all starts melting together, and you get this taste explosion in your mouth. Combine that with the lychee and the pinenuts. Foie gras in general is great when you contrast the rich flavor with the sweetness of fruit and the bitterness of nuts, and David Chang nailed this combination. Wow. Deep fried short ribs - Tender and moist on the inside, yet crispy on the outside, and flavorful throughout. That says it all...Fried apple pie with sour ice cream and miso paste - This felt like it came straight out of the Wylie Dufresne/Sam Mason school of dessert-making. Great crispy apple pie, with just enough sweetness and tartness, combined with some ice cream and some intense paste.Cereal milk panna cotta - brings you back to your childhood, it tastes like a fantastic bowl of corn flakes in milk on those days when you poured the perfect amount of flakes from the box and added just the right amount of milk, and the cereal has been soaking in the milk long enough to impart its flavor, but not long enough to melt into the milk.Also, the pasta with mascarpone and snails that Janelle mentioned was pretty good, and so was the hens egg with caviar and potato chips (though I have to say, many others are doing pretty good things with eggs these days). Of course, my review of each dish is a bit irrelevant, because if you go, you'll eat exactly what they feed you and like it. So should you slavishly mark out 10am every day to sit at your computer to try to book a res here? The answer is yes, because some of the dishes served were transcendent. However, I will say that I have had recent meals at L'Atelier, Adour, and Dovetail, to name a few, that were consistently better throughout all the courses. So sure, if it takes a few seconds of your time, try to score a res. But if you don't get one, don't worry about it, and go eat at some of the restaurants above (and others) that are just as good or better and won't cause you as much stress to book.",11,0.9989

I had a mean hankering for this slice thanks to The Gothamist photos posted last week and I had resolved to get to Artichoke ASAP. It was indeed that serious. I mean, when people compare you to the supposed best pizza you must be pretty damn good.I didn't wait long. I think I was just lucky.The cutie behind the counter spoke softly to me, asking what I would like. And upon noticing my hesitation immediately suggested the ""Special"" slice also known as the artichoke & spinach. It looked so beautiful in pie form. And in my world where food reigns supreme ... looks mean a great deal. I could've looked at that pie all day. In fact, as I waited for the slicing guy to portion out the goods I couldn't tear my eyes away.Finally my order was up. My Italian cutie boxed my order up and with a flirtatious smile sent me on my way. I emerged from the storefront beaming. It smelled so good. I opened the box to reveal two slices, one for me and one for Julie (you owe me 3 dollars b*tch.) I held it in both hands. Tried to fold it over Brooklyn style but that didn't work out too well. I got cheese on my shoe and hand and enjoyed every glorious minute of it. I love pizza. But this ain't your ordinary pizza. It's my new favorite slice and if you ever want to get me out of a bad mood or convince me to do something, it's almost a guarantee that I will be amazingly agreeable after a slice.All other ""New York"" pizzas that I have tried truly pale in comparison. And I'm not just saying that because I was full of mimosas. I swear it really is good, great, fantastically marvelous, orgasmically wonderful pizza.It's not just pizza. It is an experience.So I'm thinking I'm going to need a slice for lunch tomorrow. You in?--UPDATE 4/9/2008: It wasn't a slice for lunch the next day rather a couple slices for dinner 2 days later with 6 other yelpers in tow. You know how I'm always talking about cute boys and in particular the one cutie I mentioned above? Yeah ... well guess who put me on blast last night?Cutie at the Counter: ""You write for Yelp don't you?""Lauren S.:""Yeeeeaaaahhh ...""CATC: ""I read your review! You're Lauren S.!""LS:""Yeah I am.""

Yes, the little GODDAMN IT'S COLD tears streamed down my face. I wasn't really about to cry, but I wanted to. The host was very cool about it. He saved our table the whole time, and was never snotty (take a lesson, Essex-bitches). When our 4th finally arrived, she was seated, given a drink, and she chowed down with rest of us. She even waited less than us for her meal!The second reason I cried was the all-you-can-drink-in-60-minutes deal. The choices are margaritas, bloody mary's and mimosas. And you can try all three. No stupid rule about how you can only get one kind and have to stick with it. I am not a tequila girl, but the margarita was definitely doable. I tried the bloody mary, and as I expected, it was disappointing. I stuck with the mimosas. Nuum.I ordered the pulled pork and scrambled eggs, and substituted cheesy grits for the potatoes. The pork was pretty good for non-Memphis style BBQ. The sauce was, well, not. And here is the third reason I almost cried (seriously, the tears welled up): the cheesy grits were so good, just like my Grandma M. used to make. I ordered a second helping. I sniffled and promised myself I wouldn't cry in front of my friends. The waiter did not make any fuss over the substitution I requested, nor did he make trouble when my associate asked that her fried chicken be dark meat. The staff was helpful and accomodating, as in, brought us drinks and made it snappy. And OK yeah, good-looking, for the most part.In addition to all this, please note that you get unlimited homemade mini-muffins.

Walk away, for in reading you'll implicitly relinquish your right of opinion or critique, compliments of your morbid curiosity.It was with a quiet step that I entered the 125 year old church in the heart of Astoria some time ago. I was alone. An inevitable feeling of solace inundated me as a I walked through the empty atrium and it's arches; it is not the same peace I've felt before on an empty Opera or an empty Movie theater; in here my psyche subdues my inner core and forces it to surrender; this is the place where people come to worship a mystery. I kneel. A willful act against one's will. A contradiction as much as an exercise of sobriety; for I know full well how to speculate with the only currency with which you can purchase an argument of rejection or acceptance: prudence. And it is prudence that has lead my heart to be contrite. Now I headed towards the little room where I was about to make my confession; I passed the huge tapestry hanging in the wall, which had always puzzled me for it's references to the Knights of Malta and other symbols, and that day was no exception.It was quiet, no one there but me; I entered the confessional, the priest noticed my presence and it began:Me: ""Forgive me father for I have sinned..""Priest: ""How long before your last confession?""Me: ""......... I-I don't remember""Priest: ""What are your sins my son?""Me: ""I've engaged in sloth and gluttony, eating and drinking showing no regard for my body...""Priest: ""Go on...""Me: ""I've been vain and wasteful in my ways father; I've used my time in intrigue and useless diversions...

Salisbury Steak comes to your table steaming and cooking on the iron plate. the sauce is done just right... it's surely a crowd pleaser. Spicy Rice Cakes (""dduk bokki"") is simply a common *anju; perfect when paired up with beer or ****poktanju; it incorporates ramen, fishcake (""o-deng""), and fried potstickers (""twigim mandoo"") in the dish. the paramount and most favorable *anju are the Sweet Potato Frites. it was absolutely amazing! crispy and light--- these are sure to be gone within 10 mins on the table. the olive medley is favorable... but the fruit/cheese platter is fabulousity; with their beautiful artistry in cutting the fruits... that's what i love so much about Korean/Japanese culinary. they spend a great amount of time constructing the most stunning things from simple foods. being the lush that i am... now, more information about the drinks. the Lychee ***cocktail soju is one of the city's best. placed in a hollowed-out glass bottle w/ a compartment for dry ice (to keep the **soju cold)- this is the perfect cure to the summer blues. Blueberry ***cocktail soju is a very admired option here. unlike most establishments, the Third Floor Cafe blends fresh fruits and **soju instead of syrups and powdered mixes. the drink doesn't go down as smooth like a typical alcohol-shot... but it's so delicious and diverse than your usual palate! Yogurt ***cocktail soju will always be my first love. smooth- with a milky undertone and carbonation from the Chilsung Cider (Korean sprite/7-up) is simply an experience no one can forget. the unique martinis and cocktail specials are worthy of a try, too. one of the chocolate/raspberry cocktails is invigorating for your warm soul. it is frozen/blended and fun to eat and drink... in essence, everything on their drinks menu is inventive and delectable. i'd undeniably encourage a taste of them all! for the anti-cocktail folks- there's something very appealing and cool for you. your very own BEER ON TAP! you select the beer, they'll bring you an ice-cold metal beer tap.

1990,10,10,5.0,"Le Bernardin deserves its gazillion-point Zagat rating for many reasons, but I'm giving it 5 stars here for one highlight of my dining experience: I was pleasantly surprised to find that each stall in the women's bathroom was stocked with feminine hygiene products. In a city that thinks that chicks will steal tampons with the same zeal with which they apparently steal toilet paper, Le Bernardin is a pioneer in the field of women's rights.The food wasn't bad either. Tuna tartare, spicy black bass, chocolate corn served three ways . . . each dish was beautifully prepared and fantastically plated. My dining partner had a monkfish entree with truffle sauce that was to die for -- I seriously considered stabbing him in the neck with one of my many silverware options and comandeering his meal. Fortunately for him, Le Bernardin's decor has a soothing effect, and by the time I was midway through my entree I was too satisfied to do anything but bask in the glory that is this restaurant.I see that the service has recieved mixed reviews, but my experience with the many servers with whom we interacted was nothing but superior. We got this great table in the back of the restaurant where we could scope out the other diners, all of whom looked like big wigs in their respective industries, but the servers still treated us like VIPs even though we were obviously young and possibly disfigured.Le Bernardin is a great restaurant with a great location and great food.

It's hard for me to get this out in the open. So bare with me. I.  *deep breathe*I tend to over eat.THERE. I said. My God, it feels good to get that off my chest. When I'm surrounded by good food, I can't say no and I end up shoveling it into my mouth. And I literally mean I shove it into my mouth. I carry a small shovel with me where ever I go. It helps with food and also to helps me dig myself into holes (which I'm known to do).Anyways, my girlfriend desired fondue so I took her to Swizz. I heard good things about the restaurant and we heard that they had a large pile of cheese related things on the menu. I wore some tight pants hoping that if I keep my stomach from expanding, I won't overeat (in case the food was good). Obviously I'm deluding myself because my stomach can lift trucks if it wants. We arrived late for our reservation but it wasn't a problem (stupid subway). The host sat us down in the small narrow restaurant. The walls are brick and are adorned with photographs from a local artist and there is a beautiful wall display of wine. We ordered the traditional fondue for two and a ceasar salad. The salad was delicious, presented very artfully and prettily (that isn't a real word but I like it). The fondue was then presented in a large bowl. There was a mountain of cheese in the bowl. The bread was firm, delicious, and perfect for dipping. There was so much cheese in the bowl, I contemplated taking a bath in it but I'm not sure I'd want cheese stuck in my pores. Though maybe I do. I could start a cheese-in-pore cosmetic trend. I'd become famous, have commericals, ads, sponsor my own ""cheese girls"" and get free season tickets for the Green Bay Packers. And I don't even like the Packers. Hmm. Well, screw that then. I'll hold out for the Broncos.The great thing about the food at Swizz is that besides being a large helping, the food is so good that you don't feel like there is a brick in your stomach when you leave.

1992,12,11,5.0,"Specializes in Pig's Feet???I would definitely call myself an adventurous eater. I enjoy chicken feet, intestines, tripe, kidneys, hearts, if it is cooked right. But, I really wasn't sure about a place that had pig's feet in every dish on their menu.Pig's feet done all different ways- marinated in miso, simply salted and grilled, sake infused, etc. But what really shocked me was that they did not just make the tonsoku (Japanese for pig's feet) Japanese style, they also made tonsoku ratatouille and in pasta Italian style (tonsoku cabanara and a few others).We ordered about 6 different dishes. The best was the Tonsoku Hot Pot- they bring a hot pot similar to shabu shabu or sukiyaki with the ingredients and sauce already in the pot. The sauce looked gelatinous- like runny jello. After it heats for about 10 mins, the gelatinous goop becomes thick soup. The dish was deep, rich and savory with nice dark marinated pig's feet and flavor-soaked vegetables (the shitake was extremely flavorful). Another excellent choice was the simply salted grilled tonsoku- nothing complex just salted with sea salt and grilled- so tasty and brought out the uncompromised taste of the pork. I also enjoyed the Oreilles du cochon (pig's ear) marinated in vinegar soy. Fun texture in a cold vinegar dressing- nice start. The desserts did not stand out although I did enjoy the rare cheesecake after the meal. It was in the texture of thick whip but had a sweet taste.I would definitely return. Next time I'd love to try the rice bibimbop (using the hot pot sauce after the hot pot dish which leaves a nice thick savory sauce in the hot to cook with) and the Deep Fried Tonsoku ""kara age"".

1994,19,23,5.0,"When I was a kid, I had a weekend ritual with my friend Shlomo. On a Saturday afternoon, I would journey out to his house in Flatbush on the D train (at the time) all the way from Bedford Park Blvd in The Bronx. It's a LONG ride. At some point around dinner time, he and I would depart his parents' house and head to Avenue J and get falafel sandwiches, take our sandwiches over to Midwood High School stadium, and sit behind the bleachers in the aisle and chow. Then we'd smoke our really bad nickel bag of weed and head over to watch Rocky Horror Picture Show at the Graham Theater, stoned out of our gizzards. Ah, them's were the days.Unbeknownst to me, I was walking right past pizza greatness over and over. At that time, good NY pizza was less of a rare find than it is today. Back then even the average ""joe slice,"" as I like to refer to it (a slice you could get at any local pizza joint), was decent. No such luck today. Ray's Pizza (the real orginal one on 11th St and 6th Avenue) pretty much sucks ass and disappoints on every level, and most places just cook a million pies with a zillion ingredients and leave them splayed out behind glass for you to choose from their overly cheesed, overloaded offerings. Yech. I see those places and I walk right by.As has been previously noted, this guy has craft. The pizza is freakin' delicious. In my view, you can absolutely NOT take stars off for the wait. If you go here, you know you're waiting. It's part of the experience. There's plenty to read on the walls, with reviews and accolades taking up most of the available space. There was even a group of folks that made an evening out of it by bringing two bottles of wine and staking out two tables at the back where they were patiently waiting for their pizza. Be prepared to wait. Take the experience in and enjoy. There's so much going on in this place that it's hard to be bored.You DO have to keep an eye on things, because Dom is not the most organized fella. Pizza maker extraordinaire, absolutely. Man with a system, definitely; but making pizzas in order is not his forte. One of my favorite moments came after we'd been waiting almost an hour, and had watched people that had ordered after us pick up their pies and leave. Dom's daughter was there helping out this particular evening, taking orders, bringing him dough for new pies, and extra ingredients for the orders that called for them. At one point she'd brought a tray of ingredients that were clearly ours and put them on the pizza table for him to use on our pizza (half sausage, half pepperoni, all onion) which sat there for about 15 minutes, untouched. The exchange went as follows:Dom's daughter: ""I'm really sorry, I don't know what he's doing.""Me: ""What do you mean? If YOU don't know what he's doing, we definitely don't!""Dom's daughter: ""He keeps making plain regular pies and forgetting to put the extra ingredients on them.""She shook her head and went in back. Soon enough Dom grabbed the tray of ingredients and put them on our future pizza.The pizza, when it finally arrived, one hour and twenty minutes after we'd walked in, was spiritual. Unfortunately, my half of it (I eat kind of fast) was consumed within about 7 minutes of arrival. The crust is sublime, the sauce delicious, and the confluence of cheeses, all melted together is unparalleled.A few of observations (some new, some retreads):1. It's absolutely retarded to point out the decor or the cleanliness of this restaurant. If you want sterile, steel counter pizza, go elsewhere. This place hasn't changed in 45 years and it's good, just like it is.2. I loved that, on the menu above the pizza table (and the old cash register that sits apparently unused and broken with the drawer wide open) it says:PIZZA SLICESREGULAR OR SQUARE        4.00and RIGHT underneath that:REGULER OR SQUARE        5.00(with toppings)You can't buy that kind of cool. REGULER. It's fantastic.3. Proof that Darwinism has gone horribly awry with regard to humans (this has been pointed out, but I have to repeat it because it's so unreal):People actually do show up to this place for SLICES. In case you didn't notice, the prices for slices are clearly designed to dissuade you from ordering them. In my view, you need to be relieved of your privileges as a human if you do this. The idea that you would show up for a slice is completely unfathomable. If you are reading this and have done it, please, PRETTY PLEASE, find a painless way of taking your own life. Soon. This is clearly just one of the more minor manifestations of your abject stupidity, and you need shuffle off this mortal coil before you hurt someone with actual brains by accident. I'm serious.

Al (owner) was super-cool (i think that's the california version of cool) and he is at once warm, inviting, friendly... one of the best, brightest, most genuine smiles you'll see.  just like his shop.  a crazy shop at that, which looks like an old antique sale...except i don't dare ask if any of that stuff is for sale because they feel like his family heirlooms or something.now MOST bagelshops have family heirlooms and they're called ""last week's bagels"".  not this shop - they are always warm and toasty and i SECOND the nomination for no-toasting (as leslie R did - scroll up or down depending on how many votes she has, as we're in direct competition).i always get #2 (lox, cc, tom, onion)...but instead of the cc i go for tofu scallion because it WILL knock your socks off.  it's the best brunch-time sandwich (and only $5.99!) in the east village any SAT or SUN... and when i'm writing music / lyrics and all that crap i go to bed at 3 or 4, wake up at 12, head down there at 2 or 3pm for breakfast (because just like you, no matter what time i eat my first meal of the day, i eat breakfast).and that damned sandwich is so fricken' tasty...that i will eat there until my last living days on this earth.  or until i leave nyc.  or until they close down.  which i hope never happens.i've probably known Al for 20 cumulative minutes over 10 years' time. he's helped me thru a couple relationships, been there for me, offered friendly advice, helped me thru some heartache with his kind words. all the while ringing me up.he's like god (in those movies where the character in the corner that you least expect is god). but if they had ""what if god was one of us"" song playing in that movie i would have to get up and leave.and so would Al - because he is a man of class and genuine character.check out Al's BagelZone.  always there for you.",15,0.9642
1997,52,49,5.0,"The starting point of abstinence is often an inherent belief that what gives pleasure eventually causes pain. Before legions of Yelpers, fresh from lurking or working the talk threads, mistake my reference to things dirty, I should clarify that I only have such indulgences in mind as pastries, cheese and, perhaps, well-paying jobs on Wall Street. While I might be correct in linking abstinence to a preemptive strike from a strong mind, I am likely wrong in assuming that ""legions of Yelpers"" bother to read my reviews.L'Arte is an indulgence. You could abstain from their gelato and avoid the pain of working out, but here are some reasons you shouldn't --- The menu comprises two dozen choices of gelato and sorbet- They encourage free sampling -- as many as you'd like to try- The service is friendly, even if dispassionate on occasion- Even when the lines are long, they move quickly- The gelato is smooth in texture, and the ingredients seem fresh- L'Arte is understated cool, more so than Grom- Capogiro in Philadelphia is not a practical option- The gelato is topped off with a spoon of a random flavor!                                 ,  ,  Random                            , , '  ?

L'Arte's well-pedigreed gelato comes at a premium price, but for pistachio, mascarpone, tiramisu, biscotti or stracciatella of this caliber, I would all but give up my entire bank balance. If only I lived in the West Village, I would constantly indulge in their party packs and gelato cakes. And pay daily visits to load up on their cups and cones of gelato. But then, recent pictures of my increasingly spindle-shaped physique suggest that it might finally be time to abstain.",48,0.9694
1998,18,21,5.0,"The experience of eating at Ali's Kebab Cafe is only trumped by the food. My god. The place is as wide as two picnic tables, as long as four. The first half of the establishment is Ali's Kitchen. You walk in and you will see AMAZING food sitting there, waiting for you. I knew I found love, only a few seconds after entering the door. People treat Ali like he is one of the gods on easter island - which he actually resembles. There is a process by which the ordering takes place here. As Ali walks up to your table, everyone quiets and pays attention... he then speaks in a very deliberate Egyptian-accented English describing the specials of the day. ""We have Fish, We have Meat, We have Vegetabitarian...What is your pleasure for today?""His overpronunciation makes everything sound delicious. He is like an opera singer of the kitchen. Even during the meal, when he announces to other tables, it's nearly impossible not to turn your attention away. This is a street show that repeats every 15 minutes and I have to watch each one. We were brought our food by the man himself, as was the case for most of the room.There is nothing he touches that doesn't turn to gold. He reached in and took out the spine of my friends fish with his bare hands right on our table. He could have fucking deboned it with his tongue and we would have still thought he was still charming as hell. Our food came out very fast, considering the place was PACKED with 10 other people. Not slow at all. I've gone twice (in 3 days) and each time the wait was perfectly normal. Suggestions? If I have to... any whole fish. some shank of some sort. and something you've never had before: brains, tongue/cheek, cows foot or mountain oysters(server's recommendation). I only was able to check the first one. See you again, Ali.",21,0.9863
1999,10,8,5.0,"I was in the neighborhood for an appointment and decided to go to Robuchon on a whim. I had just finished a 2 month diet with very little fat, decadence and to my standards, very little taste. So knowing this was a 5 star yelped establishment, I thought, I've got a couple of hours and I'm not hurting for cash right now, so why not?First off, the Four Seasons Hotel where Robuchon is located, is designed by IM Pei and is a sight in and of itself.  I'd say get here a bit early and check the place out a bit. Its worth your time.L'Atelier is split into two kinds of seating. The first is counter-style seating right in front of beautiful open kitchen. The 2nd is more traditional seating with generously spaced tables in the well-designed space. Since I was dining on my own and was curious as to see what was going on in the kitchen, I decided to opt for the counter.And then I was presented with options...so many good options. The $190 discovery menu? The $60 ""express"" menu with 1 app, 1 main and a desert? An a la carte menu with traditional entrees or should i order from the immensely creative and appetizing menu of small plates? Since I was following my whims today, I decided for the tasting menu. One small problem though...eggs freak me out. I can have em baked in something, or used to coat something that's fried up, but the sight of egg in my meal makes me gag. I guess I'm just strange, but luckily, the helpful and kind staff let me substitute the asparagus with soft egg dish with the one dish I was dying to try- Les Burgers. Being a burger fiend and and eggophobe, this was greatly appreciated. So out came the amuse bouche....a shot glass with a bottom layer of a mousse foie gras, a small layer of port wine reduction, and a top layer of a foam of parmesan. In translation, a shot glass full of fat. And oh, had I missed fat like the deserts miss the rain. In fact eating made a little Everything But the Girl techno beat start in my head and my senses dance. Oh man, was I ready for an experience!Next came a beautiful looking starter in an amazing little oval/bowl plate that was obviously designed with a lot of thought for a dish like this. It was a layer of avocado, followed by a layer of gazpacho and a layer of crab meat. Light, cool and spot on. It was the perfect summer starter right in the middle of spring.This was followed by an absolutely drop dead gorgeous dish of scallops and sea urchin. A very light and delicate plate- and extremely tasty, though I regretted not taking a picture of it since it was garnished so beautifully with a little bit of green and red. Next came what I believe was the real show stopper. Langoustine pappilout with basil pesto. It was my first time having langoustine, and man, what a creative preparation. Again, artful and light. And this dish happened to be a perfect. The crispy shell and basil sauce was the perfect foil to the langoustine. I wanted more. Good thing more was coming.When I thought that couldn't be topped, next was the burger. It's a tiny little thing, smaller than a slider. It almost comes out looking like a toy. But that's not a toy, that's a little hunk of high quality beef, topped with another hunk of foie gras and some bell peppers on brioche. And that is greasy, fatty perfection right there. I realized that its so tiny because any bigger would cause a spontaneous heart attack. It was accompanied by some perfect, thin crinkle cut french fries and a ginger ketchup that has to be one of the best condiments I've had. Now that is an artist's take on the burger and fries right there.After that came a fish dish- L'Amadai. Again, something I've never had, and it was explained to me that it was similar to bass. But again, simple but elegant. It came served on a terrific citrus broth and a crispy topping garnished with some edible flowers. Much, much better than I expected and the perfect transition between the burgers and my next dish- Kobe beef.The Kobe Beef- the 3rd perfect dish of the day. It was served with a little bit of onion topping, a side of incredible, buttery potato mousse (super whipped mashed potatoes) and a little salad.  Ultimately simple, but just a beautiful execution of what the French can do with beef.Dessert was more fun times. First a pre-desert shot of raspberry and lychee, a nice cool and refreshing introduction to the sweet part of menu. Than a little papplemousse- grapefruit with a mint sorbet that was again- served in a very unique dish. You can tell there was some real artistic thought put into this. And finally, a little chocolate and coffee mousse that was the perfect ending to an outstanding meal.This was my first experience with a tasting menu and while it cost me a small fortune, it was worth every penny. An artist's studio indeed- every detail and every plate, the work of a true artist. Sometimes the experience is just worth it.",21,0.9994
2000,29,40,5.0,"In my misspent youth, I once dreamt of Jenna Jameson and Tera Patrick rubbing me down, begging me to turn over. With an abrupt earthquake, the visuals disappeared. My old man was shakin' me to get up for school. You call that a happy ending?                         In my so called life, my good dreams in which I remember are far and few in between.I know I reviewed this place before, but I haven't expressed this much love for an animal since I the days of college and the film ""Barnyard Friends."" Although I have an unhealthy infatuation with their chicken, it's not like South Park's ""Chicken lover.""Their chicken is scrumptious. No drums, just wings. Both flavors. No wings will be left behind.On the last visit (6/29), I ordered large spicy (wings only), large soy garlic (wings only), ddukboki (no ramen) and Blue Moon. The waiter looked at me as if I was Takeru Kobayashi in his rookie season (when no one knew he could eat). S questioned me also on why we were ordering for 4.""I love leftovers!"" I smiled and proceeded with the order like a blind gundygut who just won the lottery. When in Rome!Ddukboki was a nice start. We also chomped on salad and daikon while we waited for the main event. The waiter brought out this amazing jug dispenser (see photo) with beer in it. Although it had a 5000cc capacity it was only filled to about 2000. In addition, he actually cut the wing order in half and preemptively packed the rest to go (which was a wise move).Ah, but there are troubles in paradise. I have a moot language tug of war with the employees. Either one day the folks will learn more English (than ""yes"", ""no"" and ""pay now, fat boy!"") or I will learn more Korean (than ""hello"", ""thank you,"" ""the weather is nice,"" ""big t-ts,"" ""more beer please"" and ""goodbye"").Otherwise, S and I look forward to coming to THIS Bon Chon every chance we get. Upgraded to 5 stars. I adore this place. Please, non-believing @$$holes, go to Kyo Chon or the other trendy KFC spots.

2001,23,32,5.0,"First off, I have to admit, I hate roller coasters. The sensation of repeatedly being taken very high and dropped to a free fall at a sharp slope trajectory is stuff that nightmares are made of. That said, I do things, just like you, that scare the freakin' bejesus out of me just because. I mean, what is life without a little AHHH! F-ING HELL!! in it?Before you get on this roller coaster, divulge yourself of your bags and any belongings that will not comfortably fit in your pockets. Not your shirt pockets either unless they have a closure to keep the items in. There is a handy bag check right before you get into your seat.Do not bother to bring your camera on the ride. The idea that you might actually be able to take a picture while on this creaky wooden death machine is absolute foolishness. I brought my little camera and had to tuck it under my butt cheeks once the ride got going. It was like having a doody hanging out in my drawers, a discomfort that was only fleetingly experienced since most of my mind was busy screaming a death cry.My third bit of advice is to not have eaten too much boardwalk fun food. Ice cream, fried funnel cake, fried seafood whatever and lots of beer make for discomfiting playmates when you're being twisted like a pretzel through the sky. These swerves and drops are totally scary shit. It feels like you are the dice in the hand of G-d and he's working it hard for baby's new pair of shoes. The best thing to do is just Zen. On the first drop I learned that lesson. I was so freaked out, I was as tight as one of those rubber band balls you make when it gets really boring at the office. Well, that first drop doesn't fall from a level placement. It goes forward and then just a bit up and then straight down so that you actually lift upwards from your seat, suspended in air as the car begins hurling earthbound at mach speed. When you finally, thankfully, bottom out, it is possible to slam the bottom of your chin on the rail bar. Fortunately the rail bar is padded. Do not be screaming with your tongue out of mouth as this could result in very serious injury. It's a blessing and a surprise that I didn't yak myself.It helps to have your friends next to you screaming bloody murder. I had a sore throat from drinking and partying my way through Germany for 10 days and couldn't scream for myself. My friends screeching was horrifically cathartic enough to effect an emotive release for me. The crazy ride experience hearkened me to the natal birth process.

2003,22,24,5.0,"First of all, can I stab the people who failed to mention the fact that this place is beer & wine only? Brian D, I'm looking at you. Now, that in and of itself is not inherently bad - I love both beer and wine - but not knowing led to disastrous consequences, because my aging liver cannot predictably handle mixing different types of alcohol. One fine Friday night, I mixed up a cocktail of lemon seltzer, St. Germain (elderflower liquer), vodka, and fresh meyer lemon juice. I poured even amounts of this concoction into empty poland springs bottle, so that my friend Cari and I could swig from them on our jaunt over to the west village. I had made a strong beverage, so we each had a good 3 servings of liquor in us by the time we polished off our plastic vessels.It was late, well past midnight, possibly almost 1 am, when we stumbled into this dimly candle- lit, immensely cozy but not drab or shabby little bar. As you enter, there is a long bar and then a narrow seating area behind it, with the single bathroom at the end, and to your left is a second room with more comfortable lounge-like seating. Both rooms are small but not cramped. There's a lot of stone and wood and warmth here; it wins full points for decor and ambience.It was fully packed, though thankfully not quite crowded, and after a few minutes we acquired seats at the bar. The wine and beers, offered by glass, bottle, and draft, all grace a huge blackboard in neat chalk letters. The selection and range impresses, especially when it comes to the beer. This would certainly be a place to get nicely buzzed off a few Belgian ales, I think. Sadly, I feared mixing beer - as it was, I feared mixing wine, but I had to pick something!We chose a bottle of zinfandel (old vine, CA) and it was very solid; for the price, I was pleased. Sadly, after about a glass, the evil spins of alcohol doom set in, and I was forced to spend about an hour with my head on the bar. It was shameful, but my friend took on the role of chatting up our neighbours, who consisted of first, a beer-swilling alcoholic who begged her for a taste of wine ('If you want to give him some of your share, go ahead!'), then later, a gold-toothed black man obsessed with organic food and his lumberjack-styled friend (whom Cari and I considered fuckworthy, if a bit dim).Gold-teeth seemed to take an interest in me, perhaps thinking I was actually drunk and would welcome his affections, but alas, I was still able to lift my head for brief moments to spout rebukes to his attempts at conversation. At one point, after returning from the bathroom (eww) Gold-teeth dared to touch my hair (why do guys DO this? wtf!), which almost resulted in a smackdown.Fortunately, I was mostly kept distracted by the superb music the bartender (a musician himself) selected, which showcased some excellent indie rock tunes. Without a doubt, the best music I have ever heard played in a bar or drinking-place of any type. I kept asking him to tell me names, which I stored away for later purchase - Film School and Jeremy Enigk were among them, and the guy also mentioned Smooth, but my google-fu failed me on that last one.The bathroom is quite nice and surprisingly not that small; definitely better than in your average corner or dive bar. The service was lovely, the drinks are great (albeit liquor-free), and the crowd is cool, if not a wee bit interesting at moments. I'll be back, sans vodka preload.CASH ONLY.",21,0.9969

King looked at me shaking his head, reinforcing the message written in fine print at the bottom of the menu. ""Minus one star for your review later,"" he said and smiled. But I couldn't resist. It's not that I'm a law-breaker at heart or a contrarian like King--it's just that the two fine slices of cake placed before us were too beautiful for me to desecrate without savoring the memory for later.So I stole a few stealthy glances, then pulled out my cellphone. Pretending to check my messages, I undertook the secret operation of capturing the classy images forever on my phone. Sleek and clean in its design, the luscious Gateau au Chocolat shone brighter than the silver fork beside it. And the contrasting snow-white cheesecake next to it made the snapshot complete. The tastes were just as wonderful as the pictures. Sweet and pungent, the cheesecake slid smoothly down the throat, and the rich chocolate cake caressed the jaw with a tingling sensation. ""My God,"" I thought, bite after bite. They were quiet moments--each moment a simple satisfaction for the taste buds. A moment where the decor of the store made sense: Its white walls and clothing-boutique feel melded gracefully with the classic silhouettes and chic tastes of the desserts, uniting the senses into a glorified experience. Surely I'd love to listen to King--who recommended Lady M and accompanied me on this excursion--and take away a star from this review for the inconvenience of capturing the memories lawfully. But at this defining moment in my limited dessert eating experience, I weaken at the knees at the thought of M'y beloved' Lady and cannot but kiss the picture on my phone and extol both cakes with five stars.

Every time I've driven past this place on the highway, my curiosity is piqued. What makes this lobster so angry? And why does this restaurant always make me think that it's a mobster hang out? Is it because it's situated on the corner with the blinds always drawn, oh-so-close to the river, where it would be easy to make deposits to where ""the fishies swim""? Alas, my imagination sometimes gets the better of me.Let me just say this, an Angry Lobster makes for a Happy Kristine. I never met a crustacean I couldn't tackle. Just ask my bf who proudly proclaims, ""Kristine can field-strip a lobster like nobody's business."" I don't like to brag, but it's true. My mom taught me the fine art of dismantling crabs and lobsters alike, and it's a skill I've put to good use in many a dining situation. It certainly didn't fail me at Filli Ponte.But perhaps I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. We found out from the numerous celebrity photos and newspaper clippings on the walls that Filli Ponte has been around since 1967. An amazing feat not matched by many restaurants in NYC. Most of the photos had Mr. Ponte posing with Joe Torre throughout the decades, but we were just as surprised to see him with Tommy Lasorda, Don Mattingly, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Bill Clinton. The Sopranos even filmed an episode here last year..not quite the mob, but they played one on tv.Filli Ponte is one of those traditionally classy restaurants where the waiters are likely to be dressed just as well as you (if not better). They were all wearing black slacks and blue French-collared shirts w/cufflinks. Their service was as professional and blemish-free as their wardrobe. No fewer than 4 waitstaff attended to our table, making sure we had everything we needed at any given time. They were also always courteous and friendly.The decor was oldschool charm with upholstered chairs, exposed brick and wooden rafters. The large dining room was very spacious and airy, with little chance to ever feel cramped. It's the perfect spot for a romantic meal or special family dinner.My bf and I came for Restaurant Week, but we ended up ordering from the regular menu b/c I just couldn't resist the Angry Lobster. They serve a full Italian menu, from the antipasti to primi and secondi piatti. Definitely be prepared to spend a good two hours here, savoring each course as it comes and enjoying the view of the Hudson River while you're at it.To start, they brought us a generous bread basket with a variety of breads, a plate of parmesan chunks, and a small bowl of roasted eggplant. They definitely bumped it up a few notches from just butter or even olive oil & vinegar. We nearly got full just from the irresistible eggplant spread.For our appetizer, we got a crab cake salad, although I was also very interested in the grilled baby octopus app and seared bay scallop special. The crab cake was perfectly seasoned and cooked, and sat atop a delicious salad w/aioli. Our meal was already off to a great start.Now onto the Angry Lobster. They serve small (2.5lbs), medium (3lbs) and large (3.5lbs) lobsters, so I went with the small. My bf went with the Tagliatelle Alla Salsa D'astice (homemade fettuccine w/brandy, Maine lobster, sun-dried tomatoes and asparagus in a tomato-cream sauce). His dish seemed pretty puny next to 1.5'-long plate of lobster, but since I let him share my dish, it evened out. My lobster, in a word, was awesome. It turns out it wasn't so angry after all, just a bit feisty. The kitchen went to the trouble of pulling it apart for me (apparently they didn't know who they were dealing with), but I'm thankful b/c it just meant I got to the meat that much quicker. They sauted the lobster with olive oil, garlic, basil and red pepper flakes. So simple yet so delicious. My fingers were dripping with oil and still, I couldn't get enough. I only took breaks in order to have a couple bites of my bf's equally delicious lobster pasta.For dessert, we tried their banana semifreddo with fresh strawberries. My bf definitely loved this more than I did, but I think I was still coming off my lobster high. In the end, I still had enough meat leftover to make myself a hearty lobster sandwich a couple days later. Don't tell me I didn't get my $70 worth!This turned out to be one of those meals that left me feeling euphoric for hours afterwards. The romantic ambiance, impeccable service and outstanding food all made for a wonderful dining experience. For special occasions, I'll be glad to come back and tame that Angry Lobster once more.",27,0.9994

2018,30,16,5.0,"Let me tell you about the only US president born in New York.I stumbled upon the TR B-place by chance; many times I had walked back and forth this stretch and I had never noticed the unassuming plaque announcing the landmark. It took me two seconds to decide whether or not to enter; why not? Let the cerebellum enjoy yet another slice of history.The townhouse's interior is a rebuilt replica of Teddy Roosevelt's uncle Rob's house; the place where he was born, and it houses a great many things concerning the late 26th president of the United States. Until yesterday, my knowledge of Theodore Roosevelt was scant; I knew that he had succeeded McKinley after his assassination, that the original FBI was created under his presidency by a distant great nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, that he expanded Monroe's doctrine of intervention in Latin America under the Roosevelt's corollary, and that the Teddy Bear was actually named after him. That's it. But I learned many things that, as the tour progressed, made me ashamed at the pusillanimous nature of today's leaders and politicians; Theodore Roosevelt was indeed what they call him nowadays, a rough rider.Born into a wealthy and philanthropic family of southern roots, he inherited his dad's active engagement to social causes, and amongst other things, TR was one of the first persons ever to talk about the protection of natural habitat or land for the sake of environmental health and patrimony. In fact, he was the forerunner of the government owned ""Historic sites"" so that places like the Grand Canyon or others could be put under the protection of the federal government and inaccessible to public plundering, very much like Prosper Merimee did in France decades earlier. He was also a true adventurer in the true sense of the word; joining the US army cavalry in the Spanish-American war, authoring over 30 books on many subjects, going on expeditions to Africa and the Amazon for ""big-game"" hunting (and actually bringing home an impressive collection of plant and animal specimens for both, the Smithsonian and the American Museum of Natural History, which, btw, he helped found and is named after him), and skinny dipping in the Potomac when not dictating policy. Nice. I would like to see Clinton or GW pulling that one for the paparazzis..The townhouse houses many mementos and personal items of TR, including the shirt, spectacle case and book he was wearing when an assassin's bullet attempted to take his life. A replica of the Nobel Peace Prize he won for brokering the peace between Japan and Russia, which, BTW, he was the first American to ever receive the laureate! Personal papers, journals, quills, many family pictures and even his baptism baby dress!! Come for 30 minutes while you watch the displays or join the short tour given by George, the Historic Site's ranger, who is very knowledgeable on TR and American History in general and will answer any questions you may have. Upstairs they have a research library which is used by many current historians and others, and as I learned, by known author David McCullough. Come to skinny-dip yourself outside today's context into a time when men were men, and come back just in time to upper your standards on what a leader should be made of; soft and erudite skin but with fierce determination-a Teddy Bear.",30,0.9839
2019,16,18,5.0,"Ugh. Stairs. But this is K-Town. So anything good is either tucked away up a flight of stairs or hidden on the 12th floor of some gloomy office building.The food here is great. Spicy chicken, dumplings, udon, strange creatures that roam the seas. Lots of bacon, ham, spam, all the better things. My favorite is the Boo Dae Jjigae (hot dog, spam, ham, cheese, rice cake, kimchi and noodles in a hot, red stew) and Ssamgyupsal (pork belly or bacon or some pork product and rice cake, also in a red stew, but spicier). The servers bring the food to your table, quickly, I might add, and light the small fire to finish cooking the stew. Do not try to eat until you see the stew bubbling. Try to withstand the spice. This stuff is no joke. Koreans laugh at those who show vulnerability.They serve barley tea instead of water. The tea is good, but the lack of water sucks, because when you get boo dae jjigae all over the front of your shirt, like I do, and you will, you want to be able to soak it off, right? The tea will only stain more. My advice: be a goddamn Houdini and invest in 50 of those Tide to Go sticks. Make it 60 in case you are not handy with a pair of chopsticks.Get the Mak Kul Lee, milky rice wine. Get soju. Get watermelon soju. They serve it in a hollowed out 1/2 watermelon. Once you have finished your allottment of soju, take your spoon, lick the porkbelly stew off of it, and use it to catch those last drops of goodness. Note: Do not pick up watermelon to get last drops of soju. Stick to the spoon. I almost got my head stuck in a watermelon the other night because of gluttonous behavior.The decor is really fun, with fishnets and soju bottlecaps all over the place. Check out the polaroids of crazy patrons taped to the wall. The bathrooms will kill you with cute. Little Morning Glory characters and mirrors all over the place. Alas, there is only one women's and one men's. Clearly, this is not enough, because Koreans get drunk early. At 8 pm, you already see folks stumbling up and down the stairs, having to pee every five seconds, and you have to share with them.

Now whether that smoke was real or not I can neither confirm nor deny because I was a bit drunk upon my initial entrance. I do know we came here to ""load up"" before we headed to PDT.I ordered a drink with vodka, ginger ale, lemon juice and something. I wish I remembered the name of it, and for some reason The Inconceivable comes to mind but I don't think thats it. Sienna had the Cloud Nine, and both drinks were delicious. But that's not the best part.It was crowded tonight so we had to sit at the bar. At the bar was a gentleman named Chris. He noticed that I had a Red Sox ski cap on, and he was offended, because he's a die-hard Yankee fan. Not only that, his various cousins are publicists for the Yankees, the Jets and the Knicks. Want more? He's the district manager for the restaurants Amber, Amber II and two other restaurants that I don't remember. More? His uncle owns Maru in K-Town and he knows Matthew K., who designed Maru and calls him a visionary genius. Still more? His aunt owns Gagopa Karaoke in K-Town. And yet even more?

This dude Chris is deserving of his own review, but I'm here to talk about Angel's Share. So yeah, Angel's Share is a most awesome place. Even sitting at the bar was very enjoyable, not the least was the fact that Sienna and I were hella buzzed - oh sorry, Sienna and I had a grip of drinks and were mad buzzed. Like she said, the joint is straight out of a shot in a Wong Kar Wai movie, with one of the bartenders even resembling Tony Leung. I loved that they were all dressed to the nines, with vests, white shirts, tie and the arm bands. Very Crazy 88'ish. Next time, hopefully we can score a table in the back lounge. But if we have to stay at the bar, and Chris is there, then we are parking ourselves at the bar. Chris made Angel's Share go from five stars to five billion stars. And he doesn't even work there!We never did make it to PDT, especially since we could barely make it down the stairs.

Sure you can go around the corner for convenience and pick up a basic bottle, but if you desire an experience, great selection and knowledgeable staff, then Moore Brothers should be on your list of places to see.I came here for a wine tasting recently. They do not do them often, but when they do, it is quite an experience. Unlike other places that have tastings where you are in the front of the store or browsing and trying not to nock over bottles, Moore has a specific tasting section in the upper level of their store. This entire floor is for entertaining and they do a very good job at it. There is a coat room, a table of cheese especially like the maps of Italy, France and Germany where they showcase the different wineries and regions - very educational and I do consider myself an oenophile of sorts.At the tastings they actually have someone from the vineyard there, explaining some of the wines, the process and their own personal commentary. I found this to be really great addition to the tasting, and recommend others do this as well. The staff at Moore Brothers was equally knowledgeable and helpful in describing and discussing the wines they were pouring.Downstairs is a large selection of wines, well laid out in a modern design and decor. As Daniel M said, they are wine importers and only carry wines which they deal with. While this limits the selection, the quality can to an extent be assured. I like how the inside of the store is kept very cool to keep all of their wines in good order. This doesn't mean that you need a jacket when visiting, but it could be a bit nippy which I actually like. MB cares not only about their wines, but also their customers and in that regard, they are a top-notch supplier that's definitely won this guys heart, or at least my taste buds and liver.Sean Approved: Absolutely Definitely Yes!!!",12,0.9981
2029,34,38,5.0,"My experience with Today's Maid was nothing short of awesome. After we signed our current lease but before we moved in, we discovered that the previous tenant was kind of... well, a nightmarish, slovenly, human cesspool who left all kinds of filth and vermin in his wake. Roaches fell off the ceiling when we were waiting for the cable guy. There was some weird scum on all the light switches. And that sickeningly sweet smell coming from the kitchen didn't disappear after our sweet landlord scrubbed out the fridge -- it was frass. What's frass? Frass is roach feces. ROACH FECES. [pause][ pause ] ... sorry. I had to go take a shower. It just makes my skin crawl to think of it. Anyway, frass forms an enamel-like substance that looks like spatters of burned cooking grease, and it's incredibly hard to scrub off. And it was allllll over the inside of our cabinets. (Up high, where we couldn't even see while standing on a step-stool ladder before we signed the lease.)It was too much for me. WAY too much for me to deal with. So I asked friends for recommendations and my pal Martha gave me the number for Today's Maid. Today's Maid had their driver drop off Flora right on time. Someone at the office had relayed my instructions really clearly to her and she already knew what areas I wanted her to focus on. It took four hours to finish the kitchen & bathroom (the only rooms we needed help with). It really was that bad -- she was working hard the entire time she was here. When she finished, the tile sparkled from floor to ceiling and my cabinets were free of frass-enamel and that sickly sweet stink. Bonus points to Flora for not flinching even as I smashed roaches with my bare hands on the counters she'd just scrubbed. (I cleaned those up myself. Anything else would've just been rude.) Her vigorous cleaning stirred up the survivors the exterminator hadn't gotten a couple of days before. I'm so pleased with the thorough cleaning, convenience of having all necessary products brought to me and the professionalism of the maid and coordinators I spoke with on the phone. For an inaugural 4 hour cleaning + a huge, comprehensive box of cleaning supplies (which spared me from having to shop for them myself!) TMS set me back $160. That's it. That's all. It's not a luxury I'm going to use all the time, because I'm fine with cleaning up after myself, but cleaning up after nassssty prior tenants? Today's Maid all the way.",47,0.9902

Like New York, it doesn't give a shit what you think.Everyone remembers the first time they had pizza at Joe's. It's like a NYC milestone experience.As for me, Joe's reminds me of my father. As a little girl, I'd watch a younger version of him say ""Lock the doors,"" before running out of our beat up VW to grab a slice. Simply because I was hungry. He'd wait on line and smile back at me, shivering through the winter's cold. Through the years, my father went from being in NYPD uniform, to transforming beneath undercover attire, to finishing his career in a fancy suit and tie as a big shot detective. His favorite pizza spot remained the same, and slowly it became my favorite too. He could have easily told me to run out and get the slice myself while he waited instead. Yet there was something simple, thoughtful, and unspoken about his kindness. Kindness surrounding a Joe's slice late at night. Years later, I'm 25 and donning my purple graduation robe. My dad's older now too with salt-n-pepper hair, driving in the black Mercedes he's always wanted, and paying a price for all his years on the NYPD: a crippled gait that warrants the use of a cane, but of course he'd rather keep his dignity. As our night comes to an end, we somehow end up at Joe's. ""You wanna slice? Lock the doors, Nicole, "" he runs out with a limp and comes back and hands it over with pride.

Everything I have had has been very good: Croque Madame (ham, cheese and sunny-side-up eggs on thick, pressed bread), the Belgian waffle dessert, the steak au poivre (so tender).The selling point for me are the mussels. They're always plump and sweet and they come in a bunch of sauces though I'm partial to a standard wine and garlic. The selection of beers is very good (all Belgian) and the bartenders are eager to help you select a pint. Service is very friendly and attentive and I'm amazed at how quickly the tables turn there without ever making you feel rushed.They have a bunch of deals that I've never taken advantage of (all-you-can-eat mussels seems crazy to me because their regular portions are so huge, but there are also 1/2 price bottle of wine nights and other promotions listed on the website.) Petite Abeille is my answer to a quick bite and is a staple of the Gina NYC Diet.Thank you. *TAKES BOW.*",14,0.9961
2032,28,27,5.0,"Pride and Prejudice (C'mon, you KNEW this would happen one day!!)It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a large appetite and seated in a chic restaurant serving a cuisine not his own - must be guided through the experience. However refined the cultural sensibilities of such a man maybe, he is rightfully considered a village bumpkin who must be saved by his discerning female dining companion from the faux pas that's just waiting to happen.Elizabeth, however, had different motivations. As she surveyed the clay pottery hanging on the ceiling, she took in a moment to cast a glance at William T. Fitz (W.T.F.) Darcy. He seemed an odd mixture of reserve, sarcastic humor, and a sense of personal pride in his taste that bordered on arrogance. While charmed by his well-bred manners, she had been slighted by his response to her suggestion that they dine at Pylos. ""There isn't a single Greek restaurant outside of Astoria that would not be a punishment for me to dine at. Would the experience at such an assembly indeed be much superior to that of consuming gyros in the wee hours of the morning after a tete-a-tete at a speakeasy?"" While lively and with a playful disposition, strong minded Elizabeth found this position rather ridiculous and was determined to give him one of her set-downs.As the server poured a glass of Cabernet / Agiorgitiko (Monemvasia Peloponese 2003), she leaned forward to inform Mr. Darcy that she would like to decide their fare for the night. She disarmed him laughingly, ""I do so that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste."" Darcy leaned forward: ""Indeed, I do not dare.""The first appetizer was Poikilia, a trio of dipping sauces - Tzatziki (thick, tangy yogurt dip), Taramosalata (lemony fish roe), and Melitzanosalata (grilled eggplant and extra virgin Greek olive oil). As she dipped the warm pita bread in the dip, Elizabeth inquired of Darcy's views on human weaknesses that exposed one to ridicule. She also asked whether he found the Tsatziki similar to that served by a street cart vendor. Darcy ignored the latter question and chose instead to clarify the difference between vanity and pride.Soon, the next appetizer was brought to the table: Ta Afrata Keftedakia Tis Dianas. The fragrant and flavorful meatballs were as close to perfection as Elizabeth had ever encountered. When she saw Darcy eating quietly, it dawned on her that amazing as they may taste, it appeared that he had resolved that no sign of admiration should now escape him. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words through this course.The third of the Mezethes was now upon them: Octopus braised in sweet and spicy red wine served with fava puree. As Elizabeth shook her head, Darcy smiled ever so slightly while drawing the attention of the waiter to bring them some lemon to enhance the flavor. The waiter returned soon and brought along the final appetizer for the evening: Saganaki Tou Merakli - three Greek cheeses melted in a pot. Darcy commented upon the conscious preference of the Mezes over the entrees. Elizabeth paused to respond, ""Surely, one as culturally aware as yourself, Mr. Darcy, would know that is the preferred way to enjoy the cuisine?"" Darcy struggled for composure, ""I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavor at civility, I am thus rebuked.""In the absence of a response and to overcome the uncomfortable silence that followed, Darcy commended Elizabeth's restraint in forgoing chocolate (Ouzo spiked chocolate mousse) that was dear to her heart in favor of authenticity - the warm Galaktobourekakia (buttery phylo triangles filled with Greek custard and drizzled with cinnamon and honey).After a few bites of the excellent pastry, Elizabeth addressed the issue, ""I trust, Mr. Darcy that you never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice. But, it is incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly."" Darcy responded agitatedly, ""I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power not to concede my earlier judgment. But, my feelings will not be repressed anymore. You must allow me to tell you how much I ardently admire and love the food at Pylos. It is decidedly worthy of one's affection, and not beneath it.""",26,0.9955
2033,14,10,5.0,"Last week, a bunch of us got together to watch the NBA playoffs and we ended up picking up some pies from Di Fara. My Wizards went on to beat down the Cavs by 30 points and we ended up getting 4 pies: 1 plain, 1 porcini, 1 pepperoni, and 1 sausage. First of all, I HATE pepperoni like it stole family property. The kind you get from Papa Johns and Pizza Hut are always salty, greasy, and crunchy at the same time. How do they get that way? You gotta try to get anything to suck as bad as the pepperoni does at most places. Alas, I suffer in silence whenever I have to get pizza with friends. People get surprisingly pissed off when you criticize their favorite toppings. The loneliness of this pizza-topping stigma has followed me my whole life.This pepperoni that Dom uses was unbelievable. Chewy, thick and shaped like a tire instead of a frisbee. Not too salty. Not too greasy. It was amazing. I loved this slice of pepperoni so much. In fact, this slice challenged every preconceived notion I had about pepperoni. It shook my fragile id to it's very core. In a delicious way. All of the toppings were fantastic. The porcini was great and so was the sausage. All of the toppings were sliced surprisingly thick but none of them were overpowering. The blend of 3 cheeses was the proverbial MVP and the oil and basil were nominated for the 6th man of the year award only to lose in an extremely close contest to the handmade crust. This was, by far, the best pizza I have ever had. So if there are any other pepperoni haters out there who read this review, you don't have to suffer any longer. Please, get a pepperoni pie from Di Fara. You owe it to yourself.",13,0.6185

2036,43,12,5.0,"Sandwiched in between a Dunkin Donuts and a some other conglomeration on a particularly unattractive and homogenized stretch of Hwy 46, Trovato's stands proudly in it's own building surrounded by an often full parking lot. Know by area locals, Trovato's is a few miles down the road from Lodi where the fictional mobster haunt from the Soprano's, Vesuvio's was located. Lodi also was the location for the also fictional Bada Bing and Satriale's Pork Store. It would not be an exaggeration to claim that Trovato's hosts Mafioso on a daily basis, but without all of the Hollywood pomp and circumstance. Lacking the elegance and glamor of its fictional counterpart, Trovato's is still an attractive place to eat. My father was for many years the Borough Manager of Lodi, and ate lunch here on a weekly basis. Over the last fifteen years or so I have accompanied him on many occasions. I had not been to Trovato's for about six years until last night, since he and my stepmother moved to south Jersey. Last week when my father told me that he and my stepmother would be making a rare trip up to North Jersey and that we would be going to Trovato's, I was as excited as a six year old going to Disneyland. I, My father (who the family has always called Uncle Junior), stepmother Ginney, cousin Kathleen and husband Mark, my aunt Zina and uncle Joe arrived at Trovato's at about 7 o'clock after beating the Friday night traffic. My father was greeted by an older waiter that knew him from years past. They exchanged pleasantries in Italian and we were all quickly seated at a large round table. Scanning the menu I made sure that they still had one of our favorite appetizers, Escarole and Beans (listed under vegetables). I was very happy to see that they did. We ordered two carafes of the house wine, one red, one white. For house wine it was more than adequate, but if I were choosing I would have selected one of their many other wines. Fresh warm delicious bread was delivered to our table with garlic infused olive oil, as we looked over the menu and sipped our wine. The waiter placed a complementary plate of the best Bruschetta I have eaten on the table, along with five excellent house salads.To start we ordered the Escarole and Beans, Fried Calamari and Fried Zucchini. For main I ordered the Linguini with Shrimp and Wild Mushrooms. My father went with the Rigatoni in Vodka Sauce. My stepmother chose from the specials, ordering the Penne with Escarole, Beans and Shrimp. Mark got the Shrimp Scampi. My Aunt ordered the Filet of Sole. After that I lost track of what everybody was having. Our appetizers arrived and I was worried that all of the anticipation that led up to this moment would now let me down. When you remember something so fondly it is most times hard to go back, and it is rarely as good as remembered. I squeezed lemon over the Escarole and Beans and lifted the fork anxiously to my lips. The first thought that came to mind upon tasting was, ""How can escarole and beans sauteed with a little garlic and olive oil be as magnificent as this?"". It was not as good as I remembered, it was better. The calamari dipped in their chunky medium spicy red sauce was also perfect. The fried Zucchini was delicious, but I mostly kept with the former two.Our main courses arrived in massive white pasta plates. The first things that I noticed were the four huge shrimp that adorned my pasta. Large, juicy and flavorful, I had not seen their like since dining by the Mediterranean. The Pasta itself was perfectly Al Dente. This all came in a wonderful light red sauce with scrumptious wild mushrooms. I don't believe that this dish could have been better.I tried my father's Rigatoni and it too was perfect. As popular as vodka sauce has become, I think it is hard to find a truly excellent one. Look no further, Trovato's has achieved excellence. I then tasted my stepmother's Penne with Escarole, Beans and Shrimp. The flavor is similar to the appetizer, but with the same afore mentioned giant shrimp. Though wonderful, I would always probably go for the appetizer over this main dish, so I could try other flavors when I have the opportunity to eat here. My last taste test was of my aunt's fish. To me Filet of Sole has always seemed to be on the boring side of the culinary rainbow, my aunt Zina's meal being the proof contrary to this opinion. The fish was a buttery marvel, erupting with flavor.Like a man in the desert, I knew if I didn't pace myself I'd never make it out alive. So, I didn't try the other three dishes. They all looked very good and everyone was more than content, minus my cousin who mistakenly ordered a red sauce.In the end we sat there, sipping wine, the table littered with doggy bags, and the older waiter brought over a large glass tube leaned against his shoulder filled with Grappa and two whole fresh pears, and as he had always done, filled a small snifter with a metal ladle for each of us, on the House.",41,0.9989
2037,18,12,5.0,"I was strolling past here one afternoon and the silvertone corset-style choker in the window caught my eye; thick, curved silver with leather cross ties in the back. Wolf's huge dog is very friendly, and will greet you happily as you descend the stairs into this small basement shop.Fortunately for my wallet, I'm allergic to silver, which is by leaps and bounds the primary metal Wolf works with. He handmade all of the jewelry and accoutrements in his store, and everything is unique and stunning without losing its innate simplicity. Hammered silver rings, finely etched cicadas eerily lifelike in their realness, studded silver arm protectors (in case you anticipate an old-school battle or perhaps an upcoming Ren Fair)...there's a bit of everything, though as said, almost all his stuff is silver. I spoke with him at length, though, and he told me he'd happily work in other metals, such as white gold and bronze.When I win the lotto, I plan to have Wolf make me several matching sets of jewelery in pure rhodium.

2040,13,8,5.0,"This past Monday, my college buddy and I ended up at Sakagura after we couldn't get reservations at Nobu (at a decent hour) and Paper Moon.. was apparently no more - both places I've never been to. A lot of effort just to eat.. however our back up back up plan, Sakagura, turned out to be a real gem.Sakagura is hidden in the depths of a non-descript office building off 43rd St., a short jaunt from work. Upon first entrance, you start off by walking down a brightly lit white corridor, turn the corner through some seemingly random door, down a flight of sketchy stairs, and enter magnificent Sakagura. First thing my friend told me, ""Hey, check out the bathrooms"". Uh.. ok. They're shaped like large wooden sake fermentation vats! Seriously, if the bathrooms are inspired by sake, you know they're not playing around.The restaurant is gorgeous. It was like running through a forest and stumbling into the secret village of the elves in the most unlikely place. Tables are set inside wooden building facades, as if you are looking down an old village neighborhood. At the center, a long sake bar decked out in sake you haven't even dreamed of yet.We were seated immediately. Our hostess was quite friendly and chatty. The extensive sake list was a bit overwhelming, largely because it was very detailed and much of it written in Japanese. It took us awhile to figure out the various menus. I must admit, in the end, my friend chatted directly with the waitress in Japanese and ordered everything for us. My only input, ""Go for it. I'll try anything"".. famous last words?For drinks, my friend had the plum wine. It was golden and tasted sweet, almost like a muscadel. I had a tasting sake sampler which featured two super premium and one regular sake shots set on a little tray. You could really note the stark changes in smoothness and taste between the three tastings.As for the food, I can only describe. The first dish was spinach with sesame and a little brown sugar. Honestly, the sesame and brown sugar reminded me of a Korean songpyun, only with spinach. The waitress brought out a salad of lettuce, tomatoes, and soft tofu next. It seemed more like a palate cleanser. There wasn't much flavor going on, even with the dressing. Next up, chicken! Fried to Japanese perfection that is. The skin was crisp and a rich tawny brown color. The flesh was warm and succulent. One of my favorites. Then on the waitress' recommendation, we had shrimp wrapped in fried flour skins (mandu wrap?). The dipping sauce seemed to consist of miso sauce with a little hot pepper paste mixed in. Warm and crispy with a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. Definitely can't go wrong there. Our shrimp wraps were followed up with a bowl of sweet sauce. In the middle, a piece of pork sat marinating, the meat and fat still clinging together in a delicate little square. The rich fat imbued the whole dish, but didn't leave a greasy film upon tasting. It was a little sweet and a lot savory with the meat falling apart with the slightest effort. As a finale, the waitress brought a tuna tartar, half covered in cavier and the other half flying fish roe with yuzu. The tuna was fresh and clean tasting. I expected the cavier to make the dish a bit salty, but it wasn't at all. The yuzu I couldn't really taste until I let the flying fish roe roll around my tongue a bit and then the citrus taste just popped in a bold way that said ""Hey! I was here the entire time"".Dessert: We ordered two, a Black Sesame Creme Brulee served with ice cream and a black sesame wafer and a Chocolate Souffle' served with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream. The Chocolate Souffle' was hot to the touch and steamed when the spoon broke through the decadent, chocolately surface. Rich, vibrant, chocolate! The ice cream was a great balance, cool and calming. As for the Creme Brulee, I've never met a creme brulee I didn't like. The black sesame was an interesting take. A more modest sweetness with a sugary crunchiness. Very good.Overall, the food was a bit sweeter than normal from what I understand. Still, it was pretty good and each dish was beautifully presented.Just like when wandering into a fairy tale village, it is quite easy to lose track of time in underground Sakagura. We started dinner at 7:30pm and I still ended up missing my 1am bus back home. (I hate it when I do that..) But, there's an intangible comfort in talking and catching up with an old friend at a place like Sakagura.review 4/17/2008I.M.Y.",12,0.9984

It rested on a huge fruit salad which included banana, papaya, pineapple, kiwi among other tropical fruit. I could only eat two out of the four pieces and enjoyed the rest of the french toast and fruit salad over the course of the next two days.

2042,28,14,5.0,"It's a crisp Friday morning, and King and I hold hands as we quietly walk towards Claude's patisserie. The air whistles past our ears, inspiring fragments of forgotten tunes and quiet promises ahead. The wind sweeps hard like slaps against our faces, but palm-in-palm, we exchange warmth that's reassuring. We reach the bakery, a safe haven in a side street of the West Village. The buttery aroma instantly seeps into the senses. It's early and the few, small tables are empty. I choose to sit by the window, and as I hang my coat on my chair, I gaze at the empty streets outside while taking in King's reflection on the window. I see him look back at me smiling as he approaches the infamously testy Claude. But--as if in sync with the warmth of pastries and hearts--Claude and his temper seem to fade for once into the background. King emerges in the forefront instead, as I turn away from the cold glass and look up at him. He places coffee, two croissants, and an unfamiliar, rectangular dessert in front of me and then he sits down. He is watching me now with that smirk in his eyes as he leans his back against the window. I smile, nervous, excited, and feel the warmth of the coffee tingling my nose. My glance escapes and falls onto the flakes of the crispy croissants. They look enticing, and I soon I discover the taste to be equal. The chocolate croissant sinks under my teeth; its sweet lump of chocolate liquefies on the tongue. And suddenly, it feels like we're not in a small bakery in a cold New York winter, but on the set of a French romance, sharing croissants in springtime. King notes the change in my demeanor and offers me more chocolate-filled croissants, more bittersweet coffee, more promises filled with longing. It all seems captivating, but I remind myself to remain disciplined, to deny myself the temptation and work with what I have. So I suffice myself with the exceptional croissant I've just had, and he pushes the mystery cake that he now calls ""Espresso Mousse Napoleon"" toward me.Its caramelized crust is hard to break into, and the creamy layer beneath does not bend at my will. King suggests we let it sit before we try it. And why not? We have all the time in the world. So we sit there waiting, conversing, as sleepy-eyed passersby now watch us from the outside: two open-hearted people enjoying each other's company, untouched by the outside world, unscathed by the fact that it's Friday, the last workday of the week. I glance outside the window just in time to catch a glimpse of a pair of eyes, longing for time to cease for him so that he, too, can come in and share a warm croissant, a thought, a sip, a feeling. But today, he must keep walking. Today, he's not the lucky one; we are. We are the ones who sit at Claude's, partaking in his delicacies, warming our hands, hearts, and palates. By now, I've raised the little cake and placed it on my coffee cup. Its cream has softened, its form has become pliable, and even the coffee is still steaming. Each bite of cake melts in the mouth, but the thin layer of caramel shatters like icy glass against the teeth. This taste is tougher to process than that of the croissants: It still offers placating sweetness, yet takes a battle to smoothen and swallow. This taste lingers. This taste is the one that filters through the fluffy, buttery flakes and sweet chocolate of the croissants, and pierces through the stuff that Claude is made of. The coffee washes over it in an instant, and soon, King and I stand up to leave. Hours have passed by now, and we walk out in the cold again. We still hold hands, and as we leave the French romance and enter the real world again, we take with us all of the tastes, our warmth, and flavors of the morning.And though we don't quite know it now, later we'll play the memory back, and we'll remember it as bittersweet as if it were today.

2043,47,57,5.0,"SOME THINGS ABOUT ME AND THE MTA [A-Z with a few jumps in between]A.) I am the loser New Yorker who, whenever the train is slightly empty, goes to the map and studies it with awe.B.) ""It's like a whole world! But underground!"" I don't know how many times I've said that.C.) I love the feeling of getting OFF the subway and emerging into the city above ground. You become somewhat dislocated every time. It's an incredible five-second experience.D.) Nothing makes me smile more than three mexicans in cowboy hats singing La Bamba.E.) Once you learn the subway system, you feel like you are step closer to becoming a New Yorker. It's an intrinsic aspect of the New York identity.F.) When you are drunk, and you sing in the stations, the acoustics are amazing!1.) Don't be a pussy. The subway is dirty. It runs 24/7. Get over it.2.) Seeing a rat indoors is good luck. Cherish it.3.) If you see something, say something! My friend once told me about a guy who showed the insides of his bag to her. In it was a fifth of jack daniels and a hand gun. He told her he was working for the CIA, and that ""we"" were all in trouble. If she would have said something, she could have received a substantial monetary reward.G.) Nobody in Manhattan rides the G train. It doesn't come here. In that case, I'll write about buses. A lot of my friends are scared to ride the buses, but if you ever need to get across town, they are your best bet. Plus, they have free transfers to-and-from the subways! You can't lose! If you are walking, and a bus passes you, pull out that Metrocard and hop on until you are close to the next subway stop!4.) MTA will take you to LaGuardia. It's a slight pain in the ass, but for two dollars, get over it.5.) People who refuse to ride the subway tend to also be the kind of people who refuse to try new foods.6.) If you routinely make the same trip, memorize what end of the station you exit, then you can get to that end of the train before it even picks you up. It can save you at least three minutes of time, and when you're in a hurry in New York City, three minutes is a life saver.J.) During winter, you can limit the amount you have to walk in the cold outdoors by figuring out which exit in the subway is closest to your destination. L.) Give subway musicians a break. The only ones that should creep you out are the old asian guys with the violin-stick things. I will never be okay with them. Other then that, the musicians are usually entertaining (if not for their music, their weirdness).M.) Metrocards should be thrown out when they are used up. We don't like the people that clog the turnstiles because they are going through every old Metrocard in their wallet, trying to find the one that still has credit.N.) I have had dreams about remodeling the subway stations. I have great ideas for this, and when I become rich (because I will be rich), I will donate tons of money to the subway's remodeling. I'm being completely serious.Q.) Hopstop.com is a great resource for people who still don't know how to get around in the city. It works like mapquest, only it assumes you will be taking subways and walking instead of driving. Print out it's directions, and then simply follow the signs in the subway station. You can't go wrong. If you get lost, ask somebody! Us New Yorkers aren't as rude as the world makes us out to be.R.) I've been on subways in London, Paris, and Chicago. New York's subway is by far the dirtiest and smelliest. It is by far the CHEAPEST. It is the only one that runs 24 hours. It is the most complex, and most ingenious!7.) This party-animal girl who lives in my building (originally from Brooklyn) once passed out drunk on the subway at 3 in the morning. A middle-aged woman and a younger man carried her up, found out where she lived, and hailed her a taxi and paid for her to get home. S.) Metrocard machines are very easy to use and display in multiple languages. You know you are an avid MTA user when you can buy a metrocard in a foreign language.V.) I once bought a snickers for a dollar from a boy selling them on the train. It was the best snickers I've ever had.W.) Why does NYU have advertisements in subway trains? Anybody?Z..) If you ever have a chance to pause and people-watch in the subway stations, please do. People behave at their most ridiculous state when they are underground.",35,0.9951

Then there's NO WAY they'll be happy with this place!!!!!  You're dooming them to disappointment, unsatisfaction, that's what you're all doing.Well, that's exactly what I was expecting, going in. After reading ALLLLLLLLLLL this YELP hype, I just KNEW I had to check out I&L like my life depended on it.

Yelpworthy?No. Words can not do it justice. After all, how can one describe the amazing wonderment of the sweetest, cutest, authentically French restaurant with the sweetest, cutest, authentically French waitress (with the sweetest, cutest authentically French accent, I might add)?OR their unabashedly letting you BYOB, even encouraging you to run down the street to grab another bottle of vino so your date doesn't have to go thristy during the meal's next course?How about the succulently spicy & aromatic PERFECT mussels in that roasted sauce (that tastes even better when dipped with the free endless french bread in it)? Moist, tender, melting chicken in a sweet complex sauce? Or the oozingly juicy rabbit sausage that makes you want to all of a sudden devour all your favorite cartoon characters (come HERE Roger! Bugs! I won't hurt you...)???I ask you...HOW??? How, you &^$%^@$!So go. Leave now. Get there by 6, when they open, and get the best spot in the house.

2045,20,23,5.0,"In a city full of restaurants that come and go and see good times and bad times, Le Bernardin is an institution, and rightly so. I would rate my experience as one of the most flawless and perfectly executed meals i've ever had, albeit, the most expensive.I could rave on forever about the food. Eric Ripert is truly doing God's work in the kitchen. At first bite of the amuse bouche of scallops in some sort of fennel / saffron sauce, I knew we were in for a treat. What I wasn't prepared for, was the excellent service.The service, as expected was good. It was DAMN good. It was so good, that I never once had to ask for anything. It's like the waiters had a 6th sense about when I needed a re-fill of water or another glass of wine. Not only were they good, but they were very helpful and not overly pretentious. Case in point: My dining companion complained that our 4th course of sauteed skate wing was a bit too salty. The waiter profusely apologized, and not only replaced her skate wing, but replaced mine as well (mine wasn't that salty, but hell, I got a free skate wing out of it).Some might say the atmosphere is overly stuffy. The dining room decor is nothing spectacular, visually. The way that the servers sauce your plate after it's in front of you, and then explain in detail (in french accents mind you) about the dish, you feel as if you might as well hand over the fork and knife and have them hand feed you (here come's ze airplane!). The jacket only service, which not only caused much embarassment to the gentlement that showed up without jackets, but a somewhat uncomfortable dining experience, as I lived the entire night in fear of spilling bernaise on a blazer that cost as much as the entire dinner.The stiff formality and mediocre decor are forgivable, because when you chomp down on the best poached monkfish that's ever crossed your lips, the only thing that matters in the world is the incredible flavors in your mouth.",24,0.9858

Since Zipcar came on the scene over two years ago, even the establishment changed and has tried to mimic Zipcars rent your car by the hour model. But Zipcar still wins my ""car sharing"" loyalty when I'm in NYC (or now in 40 US Cities like Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, London, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Portland, San Francisco, Seattle, Toronto, Vancouver and Washington DC) It's like having my own car in each city!Even their daily rates beat out the big rental agencies in most cases....but what I enjoy the best is having the option of renting a Mini Cooper, a Toyota Prius (my fave), a Volks Rabbit, or one of the many neat models they have available in each city.Gas is included too!",11,0.9658
2047,20,24,5.0,"Wow, there are some weak-ass one-star reviews for this place. Giving it 1 star because you live near it and don't want to have to walk through the crowd?

""It's just pizza!"" you say? Well, isn't that what we're reviewing here? A pizza joint? Yeah, I think we are. I'm pretty sure we are. Hold on, maybe I'm not so sure, let me check....Oh yeah, we are. Definitely. It's definitely a pizza place. So if you went there for filet mignon, you're an idiot.Back to my review:I've been to Grimaldi's many times and it's consistently excellent. I've intentionally only visited when I knew I would not have to stand in line, so I assure you that my experiences were with a clear head.It's a simple place and a simple pizza, but done to perfection. The staff take your order quickly, and you get served quickly. The crust has the right amount of crispy, slightly-burned edges. The sauce and cheese, the perfect compliment. Add a few basil leaves, and there you go: it's all you need. Of course, you could get a topping or two, and that would be fine. If you want a reasonably-priced Brooklyn Lager or glass of red wine, you can get either.So if you want to take a nice stroll over the Brooklyn Bridge, swing by here for a meal.

2049,21,13,5.0,"I was nearly at tears when I walked into the staging area for the Red Hook ballfields' food stands. My friends may tell you that it was not nearly, there were no sweat droplets on my cheeks, they were actual tears. It all comes at you like a revelation, this is IT.You walk into Red Hook Park at the elbow of an L. Flustered thinking about which way to go, people suddenly look like they are developing parkinson's. Go right to get that out of the way, then venture left.There might be 20 or so vendors. Most sell tacos, papusas, quesadillas, huaraches, and other Latin fare mostly encased by a shell of some sort. There are usually available benches and tables for sitting, you can also sit on the shaded grassy knoll. I had chicharones(dreamlike), platanos (amazing, they were the smushed variety with a sweet kick to them.), and yuca (mine were cold, so I could have done without) for $8. Huraches which were the size of keyboards, were $5. Everything we had was up there with the all-time bests (had the yuca still been warm, they would certainly be up there also-although not as high as the chichs and plantains - my god). The vendors have lots of other foods that are amazing! And mostly at the places where the lines are very small - I don't know why people are so obsessed with the tortlilas and papusas... not my thing.  Sometimes you have to ask just to see everything they have. Last time, I got trapped at the Colombian stand and got just about Everything - beef on stick, papas rellena (fried stuffed potato!), fried chicken, chorizo.. Oh, and ceviches at one of the last stands on the train. Ok now I want to go back. The only thing missing are coke bottles from Mexico. Note: The actual baseball fields are probably not the best place to discover this food. When we first got there, I went on the actual baseball fields where there are a few vendors.

Five stars for their perfectly crisp exterior and perfectly moist interior. Four stars for their (mostly parsley) flavor. (Azuri's kosher falafel are second only to Holy Land's in Berkeley, CA - the latter's falafel flavors are more pleasingly complex.) Platter pickles are also 4.5-stars: five for flavor, four for texture. Some of the pickles lack crispness, but that speaks more to my preferences than to their ability. Chicken schwarma is tasty enough but dry (3-stars). Sambusak (savory meat pastry) is also okay, but it's the falafel plate that shines brightly here. Baklava (3-stars) is more dense than flaky -- chock full of minced nuts and seasoned delicately with rosewater.The owner, Ezra Cohen, is not at all unfriendly.

2051,13,5,5.0,"The ramen craze in NYC is about to be kicked up a notch with the opening of Ippudo. The famed Japanese chain has finally opened shop in the ramen-obsessed E. Village, much to the joy of people like me and my fellow ramen-crazed/ obsessed friend, Margie L., who hauled ass in a cab to meet me here for lunch in the middle of work (what a devoted ramen fan she is!). We both went with the Shiromaru Classic ramen ($13)... tonkotsu ramen in pork broth with steamed thin Berkshire pork slices (would've enjoyed a few more pieces of this!), cabbage, mushrooms, and scallions. I chose a side dish, spicy cod roe over rice and seasoned pickles, for an additional $3. A small bowl of seasoned rice with a dollop of roe... good but not sure I needed this. Margie got the pork over rice side... which was a bit better than mine.So what is so special about the ramen here?? Well, it's all about the amazing broth. It's a really nice, rich, but not oily / greasy, milky white broth that smells just heavenly. You better believe it that this thing has been simmering for 15+ hours! The taste... soothing, a nice simple flavor (though I'm sure it's not simple to make this!), not too salty, and even better with a bit of the freshly ground sesame seeds (thanks to J T for the tip about that!). As for the noodles... it's different than the usual chewy kind that I'm used to... Ippudo's noodles are thinner and lighter, but still chewy enough and delicious. Due to this texture, the noodles didn't seem to soak up all the soup (as often is the case at other ramen spots).  As for the decor, I was pleasantly surprised at how nice, modern, and clean the place is. Alot of wood, a bit dark, and dare I say it... actually, kind of a sexy vibe, despite all the people slurping noodles and drinking broth from the big extra-wide ladle-like spoons. There are different areas to sit in, including communal tables / bars, booths, and a separate red room area in the back that supposedly can be rented out (ramen party, anyone??). Loved the cool front wall decorated with various ramen bowls and the glass counter top of the bar showcasing uncooked ramen noodles. The service was fast and quite friendly... they were all speaking Japanese to me, which was fine even though I didn't understand any of it, since this is all a positive indication that a good portion of the clientele is Japanese (or do I look Japanese?). This place is dangerously too close (right across the street) from my office thus, I'm predicting frequent visits to Ippudo for lunch. That broth... absolutely perfect and crave worthy if you're feeling a bit hung over or under the weather... I know I'll be thinking about that for the rest of the day. My instant love and appreciation for this place is a bit scary... how could a bowl of ramen trigger such excitement?? But it's the magic of ramen... whether it's all those hours that the broth has been simmering for in pork bone, the perfectly chewy noodles, or the soothing first spoonful in my tummy, I could not have been happier with my ramen. Sorry Setagaya, Rai Rai Ken, Sapporo East, Men Kui Tei, etc... but I've found a new love and I think I'm addicted.===============================================(UPDATE: 4/9/08)I went again last week to experience their full menu for dinner w/ my other Ippudo addicts. The wait was pretty damn long (6:30 on Thur)... but note that they seem to exaggerate the wait time. Alot of folks were turning away, in shock, as they were told by the nice Japanese lady at the front that the wait is ""about 2 hours"". We were told it'd be an hour and a half but waited about 45 mins. Started off the meal on a good note with a nice sake cocktail at the bar while waiting. This time, I sat at the counter, which allowed me to see the cooks in action on non-ramen items. Kind of fun... but a loud area to dine in since all the cooks yell out that Japanese welcome greeting whenever new patrons come in to the dining area (which is way too frequently). But you can't really pick & choose where you sit at this point given the popularity of the place.I was actually a bit disappointed with some of the items we tried... shrimp in garlic sauce w/ mushroom & asparagus, some special egg omelet dish (much too simple), and the matcha brulee green tea pudding was was just a tad better than average. But the Kakumi (braised pork belly) was excellent... really tender pork meat, rich in flavor, and very tasty. The tofu special was also great.I thought about bringing down my rating to 4 stars from 5... but no, I can't... the ramen is just too damn good. And that's what they're known for. I'm sticking to what Ippudo does best and is famed for... their awesome tonkotsu ramen, which is more than deserving of at least 5 stars!",17,0.9996
2052,43,4,5.0,"How could I possibly sum up all my feelings and thoughts about the World Trade Center in a Yelp review? There is too much emotional weight, too much personal history and too many memories for me to express it all here. So I won't; I can't.But I will say that the WTC wasn't just a tourist attraction to me. It was like my childhood backyard. Having lived in Battery Park City since I was 9 years old, the WTC has always been a backdrop in my life, a touchstone. When I was younger and people didn't know where or what BPC was, I referenced the WTC as the nearest landmark. When I was a high school student at Stuyvesant, we'd hang out at the Borders or any of the various shops in or around the WTC after school. On particularly nice days, you'd find us goofing around in the WTC Plaza, sitting by the water fountain or spinning 'round 'n 'round unsteadily with our faces looking up at the sky, trying to focus on the point in between the two towers and maintain our balance, but instead toppling over in fits of girlish giggles. On summer nights, we would just lay there on the ground, gazing up at the Twin Towers amidst the (sometimes starry) sky.Anytime I took the train anywhere, I went through the WTC. I would cut across through the Marriot's lobby to avoid all the crazy hustle and bustle of tourists and businesspeople alike in the main entrance of the south building. I would line up for TKTS discount tickets on the second floor whenever we had out-of-town guests staying with us. I would admire the huge colorful tapestry that hung from the wall.These are all memories that spark in my brain from time to time, sometimes vividly clear, sometimes more faded. They come and go in flashes, and I'll often close my eyes just to let it linger in my mind for a moment longer. And it doesn't take the anniversary for it to happen. I still live in BPC and I still pass by the WTC site every single day. I have seen how much it, and the surrounding landscape, has changed. No, I didn't lose anyone in the attacks. And I was fortunate to be in college in Baltimore when it happened - I was even more fortunate that my mom was also out of town that fateful morning. But I do feel like I lost a major piece of my childhood - not a tragedy in comparison to what others have lost, but any kind of loss hurts in some way.I used to be a lot more bitter about all the grief tourists who flock to the site. I dreaded walking by the area and seeing all the pictures taken, souvenirs being bought and sold, and the occasional tour group of teenagers who didn't seem to understand a damn thing about anything. But I was young and innocent once, too - on the very ground they were treading on. Now, I don't care as much. Live and let live. And if everyone else in the world could adopt that motto, then maybe I wouldn't be missing the Twin Towers so much today.",22,-0.8085

I check the hours...they are supposed to be open. I look inside and I see pies baking!!! Then a guy says...sorry we are closed...and turns his back on me. I was pissed! And Cold! Sadly...My dog and I turned around and started our frozen walk home. We were depressed....frozen....and we had no thoughts of pie to keep us warm. It was a sad sad day......sniff********Fast forward to this afternoon. I just got a new job. As a congratulatory present my friend brought me some key lime pie. What a nice surprise. I wanted to hate it...I really did...I mean I still had frostbite from the first time I tired to eat here. However...after the first bite of pie my harsh feelings towards them seemed to wash away. Instead I was filled with happiness. This was FABULOUS key lime pie. The filling had just the right amout of sweet and tangyness. The crust...the perfect amount of sweetness. It was pure key lime goodness. It had none of that fluff whipped cream like a lot of key lime pies do. I have had award winning key lime pie from the Florida keys and I have to say...this was comparable.Now that I am not so angry with the Little Pie company I think I will give them another shot...after all they have many other pies and delicacies that I need to try. But be warned Little Pie Company...you better be open next time I stop by or this 5 star rating could quickly be changed.wait...who am I kidding...this was f-ing good pie....I really could not even fathom giving them anything less than 5 stars after tasting what I tasted.,18,0.9507

Mashed potatoes are the most common filling. They are fried, deep fried, or boiled. I actually prefer the boiled. The Polish way is boiling, then frying in butter. They are usually served with sour cream, and the savoury ones can be topped with fried bacon or onions.Blintzes are made from unyeasted batter (usually made of flour, milk and eggs) and are nearly identical to French crepes. Made popular in the U.S. by Jewish immigrants as blintz are a popular dish in Jewish cuisine. Although they are not associated with any specific religious rite in Judaism, blintzes that are stuffed with a cheese filling and then fried in oil are served on holidays like Chanukah and Shavuot.

And would rate it as the best place for an after-work drink, bar none. Assuming you can get in.The library has an extensive selection of brandies, rums, whiskies and cocktails. And some wines and beers too. While we did not stay for long, I learnt enough to recognize that this is a library like no other. The walls are lined with a great variety of spirits, and the librarians are knowledgeable and polite. Ethan Kelley was our spirit sommelier -- articulate and welcoming. My Gin Gin Mule was well-made--sweet and spicy as promised. Had my friend and I stayed longer, I would have tried one of their rum, gin or whiskey based cocktails, for my second drink.The setting at Brandy LIbrary is a little too 'old boy's club' for my taste. And the crowd has more than its share of the Wall Street and law firm types. But that said, I wouldn't even begin to compare Brandy Library to Campbell Apartment, with its unpleasant service and snooty staff and crowd alike.I learnt that Brandy Library also has a 'spirit school' with Tuesday evening seminars on various spirits such as cognacs and bourbons. They do private events as well, and hold tasting events on Fridays. And, believe it or not, you can store your spirits in their facilities, I assume for a fee. You could also become a member, but I didn't check on the terms of membership.Brandy Library is within walking distance of my apartment. With the wintry winds blowing in our faces, and given the difficulty of getting a cab here to take me home, I was prompted to downgrade Brandy Library to four stars. But real people with real reviews don't do that sort of thing, I am told.",28,0.9889
2062,19,13,5.0,"Recommended for: Good time with friends, a date, place to meet an old friend.Service 4.5, Drinks 5, Ambiance 5.I've been to Angel's Share a few times and each time it does not disappoint. Concealed behind a door in _______, you'll find this lounge. At first, it screams 'Gentleman's Club' - dark woods, jazz, bartenders in vests and bow-ties. Thankfully, this lounge is a place to unwind, relax and have a good time.As a party of 4, we waited for about 10 minutes which was sooner than we were initially quoted. The front section of the lounge has the large mural and is slightly louder. They have a 'No Standing' policy, so if you see another group of friends, you can't hang around their table and block the hallway. I attribute this again to the 'Gentleman's Club' analogy. They are trying to create an air of sophistication, enjoyment and refinement. In the back, are plush leather sofa chairs that have you sink into them - ideal for getting closer to your ""date"".The drink menu IS in a binder! Great for all people who loved cocktails, infused drinks, or strait up alcohol. I went with a ginger infused vodka, or was it earl grey infused vodka with ginger? Anyway, the drink was gingery. It could've been stronger, but again, this is a mellow date place where you don't want the first drink to knock you out. She had an infused vodka with grapefruit juice and tonic. Then, she took my drink (which I was nursing). Our friends had some food, which smelled and looked good, but cannot comment further than that.If you have small groups, of say no more than 4, this is an ideal place; even more ideal for a date. Low lights, sultry sounds, and good drinks will definitely put lovers in the mood to 'get to know each other' a little closer. But if you have a larger more rowdier group, head on over to Decibel. Where this place is sophistication and refinement, Decibel is pure hilarity and fun!***************************************Update 3/4/08Been back countless times. Recently, S, J, B and I came and had an awesome time. I had a hot earl grey with gingery vodka (omg this was awesome!), another ginger cocktail, and my partners in crime had scotch, a martini and other drinks (we had a lot that night and this was the 2nd bara we hit :P ). We ordered yakittori and kara aagi and both were delicious (i think they got it from yokocho).

2063,32,30,5.0,"When faced with the pressure of coming up with a date activity for a date with someone you really like, you gotta go with the classics. Even at 10:30pm on a Saturday night, it took us 45 min. of intense tourist saturation (mullets and Italians and fanny packs, oh my!) to get to the top. A few tips: - Go at night! It's open until 2am. The lines are shorter and personally I love the skyline at night.- Buy your tickets online in advance - it's one part of the line you'll get to skip.- Skip the photo on the 80th floor, the extra $15 to get to the 102nd floor, and buying anything from the gift shop. Seriously. You don't need that Empire State Building Christmas ornament. No you don't. Put it down.- Go when it's warm. It's cold out there...But the view was truly breathtaking and worth the wait (although I did have some nice company). Classic New York, classic romance.

2064,29,15,5.0,"(My humble and half-baked attempt at noir fiction)""So this is the place everyone is talking about,"" I thought as my friend and I stood on the sidewalk after crossing Seventh Avenue... Little would I have guessed it was there, had I not carefully written down the address. From the outside, the building looked rather nondescript, but for the small dark red door at the corner. As I pulled the door open, only to find a small wooden stairwell leading downstairs, I hesitated for a moment and wondered if I really had it right... Isn't this some one's basement?... Are we ever going to come out of there alive?... But my curiosity took over and I proceeded to start down the stairs, followed by my friend. Behind two heavy black curtains we discovered a small and quiet lounge, darkly lit and somewhat empty at this early hour in the night. We were greeted by a hostess, and while waiting for a table we walked to the bar, where a rather strange looking bartender asked us what we would be drinking. ""Can you recommend any cocktails?"" I asked, slightly intimidated, but knowing better than to order my usual Grey Goose tonic in a place like this one. ""What kind of liquor do you like?""""Vodka."" ""Bad choice. Pick again. Maybe gin? White rum?""""Gin sounds good"", my friend answered. ""I'll take the rum,"" said I. He then proceeded to ask us what sort of drink we were in the mood for. Something short? strong? sweet? fresh? fruity? and another whole plethora of adjectives we never would have thought could qualify a cocktail... The looks on our faces must have betrayed our puzzlement, and we simply entrusted him to surprise us with something good. Then began the magic and the alchemy. In a carefully orchestrated dance, juggling jars, bottles and cups, he frantically took to pouring, cutting, measuring, grinding and shaking... as if possessed by some obscure power only to manifest itself in the dark and plush recesses of this small New York basement speakeasy. After a few minutes of gesticulations, the two mysterious concoctions materialized and were poured, filling our glasses to the brim with an exact precision. After handing the man a large tip, we took a sip. Our anticipation was replaced by bewilderment, as it dawned on us that our drinks, short of qualifying as nectar of the gods, were with little doubt the best cocktails we had had in New York City. A booth had become vacant. We took our seats on the leather couches, and abandoned ourselves to the degustation of our perfectly crafted drinks, with faint smiles on our faces, signs of our tacit realization that we had uncovered a gem.",24,0.9833

You go to a counter where a salesperson looks you up and down and then asks what you are looking for. They will tell you what size you are, not ask. you're probably wearing the wrong size anyway. You tell them if you want an everyday bra, a special bra, strapless etc or something else. They have everything there. Then they bring you into a dressing room where you are to strip from the waist up and wait for the salesperson to come into the room with you and give you the selections she has picked for you. Sounds scary? ok, the first time you go it is, especially if you haven't flashed your tata's to strangers in awhile.

Small ones, big ones, HUGE ones, square ones, (wait what?) ok not square ones but regardless of your shape and size, this store has the bra for you and will make your bazongas look great. It's like getting a boob makeover, and I recommend it at least once a year. The prices are higher than bloomies or Lord and Taylor, but I don't think they are sizing you at those places.

And after 6 months, I finally got to try them - and they did not disappoint! As the lovely Jessica B says, this place makes 'relentless foam'. My cappuccino was so thick, so creamy, so utterly delicious, so... superlative! If I lived in this neighborhood I would likely be a twice-daily customer. My friend and I split a cookie (a tiny, thumbprint cookie.. difficult to split), and even though it was so tiny I swear it had a pound of butter in it. It melted right on my tongue. The service is friendly and efficient, and the staff knows their product. The seating of the cafe section is very rustic, which means little wooden seats or benches, and tables so tiny that if you are taller than 5'5 you will have trouble fitting your legs under them. The restaurant inside is cozy and lively, and the outside is inviting and festive (with lights and a decorated awning).The only minuses of Via Quadronno are the high prices (you are paying for quality, though!) and the crowd - I think I saw every color Ralph Lauren cable knit cashmere sweater ever made on the men here - typical UES old money crowd.5 foamy, smooth, creamy, buttery stars!

Now, check your bank account: Are you rich? If yes, go to (b); if no, jump to (c).(b) OK moneybags, think of this month as training. The goal? Stretch out your stomach as much as possible so as to maximize your stamina on RRD (Rainbow Room Day). For the 3 Saturdays prior to RRD, you have brunch at Balthazar, Golden Unicorn for Dim Sum and Clinton St Baking Co, and Bubby's, Norma's and Pastis on Sundays. Nice job! Have you been hospitalized with coronary artery disease? If yes, go to (d); if no, jump to (e)(c) I'm sorry you're so poor. But you're going to feel like a queen/king if you can just manage to save your pennies this month, so here's the deal: No brunch for a month. In fact, no going out to eat at all this month! Two words: Top Ramen. You're going to blow over $100 on RRD (Rainbow Room Day), so you need to save save save! Now, have you been ostracized from your social circles due to a month of non-brunching? If yes, go to (f); if no, go to (e). (d) Unfortunately, you're stuck in the hospital and have lost your RR reservation. You can almost see the pretty trees in Central Park from your window if you crane your neck, but that would disturb all the tubes you've got attached to you. Maybe next year!(e) You've made it! RRD is finally here! Now is when all that preparation pays off. First, don't act like a greedy tourist. Go check out the view, it's incredible. Keep in mind that once you're in, you're in and you can stay and eat as long as you like (for reals, I think I stayed for 4 hours), so pace yourself! First, have some deviled eggs with caviar, and don't even feel bad bout taking 12 and just eating the caviar off the top. Then, go nuts!

I actually ordered a double cappuccino ($3), but the barista here (so eccentric, so great) makes a very dry cappuccino. I liked the sparing amount of milk, but I bemoaned the small quantity of foam (a 1/2"" at most), especially because it was extremely good, dense, succulent foam. I'll ask for lots more next time.I also ordered a (manual, not machine) drip coffee ($2.50) to go, which was tasty for drip coffee, and insanely, overwhelmingly strong. I had to add whole milk in equal proportion in order to get my coffee to the desire medium-brown lightness and be actually drinkable. That's sort of how filter-manual-drip coffee is, and it was tasty, and powerfully caffeinated, but I'll stick to the espresso drinks.They offer breakfast specials (at 10:45 am on a Sunday morning, this place was JAM PACKED), and I tried a bite of spanish onion frittata ($3). It literally melted in my mouth, it was so delicate and tender and cloudlike, allowing the pure, sweet onions to shine through flavour-wise. The pain perdu with fresh ricotta ($3) is also utterly amazing, and the other pastries ($1.50-$4) looked just as delectable.

2074,20,16,5.0,"Chavella's deftly avoids the decorative faux pas committed in egregious fashion by many other Mexican restaurants in Brooklyn. A handful of otherwise decent Mexican eateries in Kings County subscribe to an almost touristy notion that the customer is not benefiting from an ""authentic"" Mexican dining experience if not surrounded by an ungodly amount of gigantic sombreros, a monstrous eyesore of a mural (usually depicting a bullfight) and music blasting at earsplitting levels from jukeboxes seemingly operated by a phantom deejay. This kitsch factor tends to devalue the overall dining experience. Chavella's opts for a clean, but more understated decor, allowing the cuisine to be the focus for a first time diner, rather than the worry of being concussed by poorly hung Mexican headgear. Ever so grateful I am to have been in an adventurous mood on the Sunday afternoon I decided to eat at Chavella's. Had I opted for a more traditional item from their menu, I would have been spared Chavella's fabulously noteworthy, south-of-the-border spin on eggs benedict. Jalapenos are infused with a traditional hollandaise sauce to create a superb and altogether different Sunday brunch experience. I was very pleased that the jalapenos were subtle, and not so hot as to leave me in the throes of red faced convulsions as they often do. The presentation is quite amazing, as well...something I'd expect from a more upscale joint, rather than a hole in the wall with a big heart like Chavella's. While there was no line to speak of on the day I went, bear in mind that Chavella's is located in Prospect Heights, a blossoming neighborhood in rapid transition.

So when a friend suggested that we check out the Van Gogh letters to Emile Bernard, I really thought it was high time I finally checked out at least some of The Morgan Library's collection. First room we entered was Mr. Morgan's own spacious room where one imagines that men decanted brandy and smoked cigars while being surrounded by one of the more exquisite private collections in New York. Most noteworthy are the two panels by Hans Memling...one can drown in those colors. And Mr. Morgan seemed to have a thing for elaborate saltcellars.Mr. Morgan's book collection is in a room with secret staircases, of all things.

Among the ones I was most keen to see were one of his the pear orchard paintings which were influenced heavily by Japanese paintings as well as one of his olive tree paintings from the last major period of his life when his brustrokes and colors were moving in a new direction. Oh, and do check out the miniature marvels of the Mesopotamia seals...very curious objects and hard to believe that so much detail can be squeezed onto one minute cylinder seal.And lastly, in regards to those lunches at the Morgan...the food is quite good and service very courteous indeed.

Jan was an old neighbor from my home back in metro-Detroit. She was around from the time I was born, and remained a family friend even after she moved to California. I remember a midwestern woman, brown hair and modest. I have not seen her since she left Michigan probably fifteen years ago.""Jan how are you doing?""""Miller, I'm in the area. I'm with some friends. We want to see you tonight. Fetch me three of your most fabulous friends, and let's have a night. Don't worry about prices, darling. Dinner is on me.""CLICK!I was so confused.

2083,19,28,5.0,"When Face to Face NYC informed me that I could use this sweet goodness in order to make my girlie bits smooth and soft, I was, well, intrigued.Sugaring has existed in the Middle East for thousands of years, but is very new to our parts. (In fact, only a few salons in the city do the treatment.) An alternative to waxing, it is a form of hair removal using all natural (and edible) ingredients -- sugar and honey. Sugar has huge antiseptic and healing properties, as well, which means that if you have super sensitive skin, the redness will go away much sooner.Sugaring also hurts way less than waxing, though your first time applying it to your bikini area is going to hurt, no matter what. Especially for a girl who has always shaved (My aestician explained to me that this is because shaving an area for years gives it a ""beard-like"" result, regrowth-wise, and makes removing that hair sort of like ripping a band-aid from skin. Repeatedly.)That said, it wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting. (Images of writhing legs and cries for my mommy were in my thoughts all day.) It did hurt, and sting a bit after, but the entire process took about a half hour, and I will not have regrowth for about a month. This is very nice when you are used to daily visits with your razor. And even nicer, sugaring weakens the hair root, so less will grow back and when it does grow back, it will be thinner, softer, and much more agreeable to the sugar. (ie: next time, I may not even need those tylenol beforehand!)Lessons I learned during my very first Brazillian bikini sugaring:1 - Apparently my naughty bits were very excited to meet the sugar, and parts got moist. Even more interestingly, this is very common. (You'd think being naked in front of a stranger with hot substances would give the area pause&#823; ;) The problem with this is that when you are sugaring, the area must be completely dry and oil-free. Otherwise, the sugar sort of sticks and has to be dried with powder to be removed. I hope I don't turn into a baked good.2 -Because sugaring involves completely organic, water-soluable ingredients, it also can remove dead skin cells. So, while you think you are just getting your hair yanked out, you are really getting a great exfoliation as well. I love 2-4-1 deals.3 - Let your hair grow before waxing/sugaring! I only stopped shaving about a week ago, and because of that, there were some fine blonde hairs too short to get. Without enough regrowth, you can't get your best results. And, by the way, if you have too much regrowth, you better trim, or you'll have trouble as well.Much like giving birth, the euphoria of the results was so plentiful that I was able to hit two parties immediately after with a bounce in my steps and forget the pain -- which was in itself not nearly as bad as the hype. If you do go to Face to Face, ask for Diane. She's super sweet and happily will talk you through things. Which is pretty nice, with the whole stranger pouring hot liquids on your privates, aspect.",33,0.9969

I was convinced that I'd be under the river on the L or whatever when the tunnel would collapse and flood with water and we would all die a horrible, screaming, terrifying death.What can I say? I'm kind of morbid sometimes.Anyway, on a recent trip to Brooklyn, I stood in the very first car and watched as we made our way across the river. And you know what? It wasn't scary at all. Unlike in my neurotic fantasies, there were no gaping cracks spurting filthy water onto the tracks. Clanks and creaks didn't emerge from the walls as they strained to contain millions of gallons of brackish liquid.

I'm not sure why- probably for fear that I would ravage her and turn her into a mindless, sex-crazed stalker. Or it could be that she's related to the bride and kind of young. It's a toss up. So, when they told me they wanted to eat Indian, I needed to make sure that the chosen restaurant would be worthy of their patronage. I didn't want to take them to an Indian restaurant with typical Indian decor- I can't stand it when ethnic restaurants try to appear more authentic by decorating with crap that I imagine would be found in the Walmart-equivalent in their home country. Oh, a velour painting of Lakshmi? The curry must be delicious! I digress. Brick Lane was great. Upscale decor, clean, well-lit (surprisingly hard to find in an Indian restaurant) and not playing sitar music (no offense to sitar music afficionados).

Mind you, there is nothing overtly suggestive about the proposition, for Fika, while a verb, is Swedish for: ""take a coffee break"". My inability to do so stems from a funny incident in Istanbul, Turkey. I got into a cab and asked the driver to take me to a certain shopping mall. The cabbie turns around to me and with a broad smile says, ""Fiki, Fiki?"" As I don't understand Turkish I smile back and shrug my shoulders. He repeats: ""Fiki, Fiki?"" Global citizen that I am, I think he is probably using the Turkish equivalent of ""Rafiki"", which means friend. I nod and the cabbie drives me straight to a less reputable part of the city where I can get some cheap ""action"". As I look around bewildered, I realize that apparently single men who get in the cab in the evening are only looking for ""Fiki, Fiki"", which is evidently a distortion of the Queen's not so chaste English. I tell the cabbie (who can otherwise not speak a SINGLE word of English), that I had missed the memo on what the term meant, and that he should drive on. No, seriously, I did ask him to drive on. But, let's ""focus"" {ever heard a Colombian or South American pronounce that? :) } on Fika shall we? Even though, it is well hidden in a less frequented part of Mid Town (but for staff from the nearby Bank of America), Fika is a place for excellent coffee and espresso drinks. They use 100% Arabica beans that are flown in from a premium Swedish roasting company. I never realized till I visited the shop that the Swedes are amongst the highest per capita consumers of coffee in the world (Ranked 6th!).The coffee break in Sweden is a social institution that is the equivalent of the English afternoon tea. Thus, it is expected to be enjoyed over sandwiches or cookies. Fika has a selection of salads in addition to sandwiches that are made from Eli's bread, the only thing within the shop that they don't create on the premises. Otherwise, they take pride in saying that they cure the salmon, hand roll each chocolate truffle, and make each chocolate bar themselves. Their most popular truffle is one with a coffee cream filling. Other versions include raspberry, dark chocolate, baileys, hazelnut, coconut rum, etc.My favorite pastry at Fika is the ""Chokladbollar"" the chocolate ball that is slightly larger than an unmentionable (*), made from oatmeal, coffee, cocoa, butter and rolled in shredded coconut. This, along with ""Kladdkaka"": a sticky/moist Mudcake that is much like a brownie, provide a fusion of taste and texture that I thoroughly enjoy. Both are lip smacking good! Of the many varieties of cookies, I love the ""Drommar"", which has a crispy exterior and chewy interior. There are many others: Molasses cookie, Almond Dreams, Ginger snaps etc. to provide the perfect complement to your cappuccino.I will confess that the other reason I enjoy Fika is the sweet and friendly Swedish staff. In my, perhaps ""Bizarro"", world blondes have always been smart, competent, driven to overcome lazy stereotypes of them. It tickles me that despite the serious expression of deep concentration on her face, the ""barista"" will either mess up the pattern on the (well made) cappuccino, forget the name of the cookie, hand me back more change than she should, or make some small faux pas. I watch with the slight, amused smile of someone thinking ""In blonde, we trust"" and immediately (realizing her mistake) such a warm, wonderful, somewhat flirtatious smile comes my way that one can only nod politely and smile back. I thus walk a longer distance to Fika, as opposed to getting equally good espresso drinks, made by two Italian dudes at Zibetto Espresso Bar.And, as God gave us rationalization I tell myself it's all due to the pastries and cookies. Really, it is. Or, maybe the excellent, foamy Cappuccino. Or, the seating. Ah, whatever...(* I trust yelpers will commend my integrity in avoiding a Non sequitur reference to ""Swedish Meatballs"", just to win RoTD :P)",27,0.9983

I had my first one with Regina and have remained faithful to her ever since. She is THE BEST. And I'll tell ya why:1. She will ask if you're okay every 30 seconds, just to make sure.2. She has fast hands, and she will even brag about it. Trust me, the faster the better.3. She can do a Brazilian wax in under 10 minutes. Last time we timed it... it took only 6 minutes!4. She is highly skilled, so it won't hurt too much and you won't end up with painful ingrown hairs later. (Sorry if this review gives too much information, but I think this is the kind of stuff that ladies need to know.)5. She is super nice and will make you feel comfortable, or at least as comfortable as possible.And now, for your enjoyment, some hilarious quotations from Regina:""You won't notice... But your boyfriend will!"" (said while being meticulous.)""I can do a wax faster than you can brush your teeth!""Seriously though, she is great. The whole staff at Maria Bonita is really nice.

2106,14,15,5.0,"The first bite of their chicken turned my dinner conversation from its usual witty, worldly banter to a lower-pitched version of the old Japanese-to-English translation for the female judge on the Japanese Iron Chef (here's an Iron Chef Japanese clip for some reference - youtube.com/watch?v=JWwd…):""Oh my god. I have never had chicken prepared this way before. This is so tasty. i just want to put the chicken in my mouth and savor its flavor for a fortnight or more. It is so juicy - it is as if the chef talked to the chicken before it was killed and asked him to be extra juicy and the chicken had so much respect for the chef that the chicken complied. I never realized chicken skin was so good - I thought it would be more feathery. I wish chickens grew as big as ostriches so that there was more chicken skin to eat....""On a less hallucinatory and more succinct note, this place is great. You order an app or two and a whole load of skewers which - at $3 a pop - can'tt really break the bank. The skewers contain about three bite size portions of meat each so you can share. It's like combining the best of the sashimi experience (simple adornment to the protein, you just shut your mouth and savor each pure bite) and the sushi roll experience (you can divvy it up b/w people or have several tastes per order).The place is small and cozy. I recommend sitting in front of the preparers. The man on the grill is so focused - I've never seen someone turn chicken on a grill with such care (a bit different than the guy with the clippers at Chirpin' Chicken flipping the birds....now i realize why that's considered obscene...). The spice - looks like salt and freshly ground pepper - are carefully placed on each skewer while on the grill. Granted, it's not as dynamic a show as when a hibachi chef makes a onion and oil volcano but it's still cool to watch.Service is great. The place is small - expect a wait anytime after 6:30 or so.Here's the play by play on dishes I tried:Totto Salad - Delicious. Mostly greens with a few slices of chicken and tomato. But the shiso leaf dressing. Incredible.Kaisou Salad (seaweed salad) - nice size for two. not a HAVE to have but a nice way to start the meal.Totto Kimuchi (kimchee) - Nice crunch and spice. Again, not a have to have but a nice start.Gyoza (pork dumplings) Pretty good but not in the same league as most of the other items.Maguro Zuke (squares of tuna sashimi) - Really good. Miso Dare Mune Niku (japanese style - organic chicken breast topped with scallion and special miso paste) - Holy crap. Soooo good. Moist, flavorful. My favorite chicken skewer.Mune (chicken breast with wasabi) - As juicy as the Chicken w/ scallion and miso paste but less flavorful. I'd order two of the Miso Dares before ordering another one of these.Kuro Buta Negi Pon (organic pork w/ scallion and ponzu) - Nicely flavored. Shocked to say, though, that I Iiked the chicken flavor more than pork. Nothing makes sense to me anymore. Cats playing w/ dogs. Religion making sense. Fox News telling the truth....Tsukune (chicken meat ball, in plain or brown sauce) - Really tasty. Pounded flat and looking like more dark meat than light, it was still quite juicy. Definitely should try.Kawa (chicken skin) - Tasty stuff. A little saltier than the chicken pieces. I expected really thin pieces like you flake off a BBQ chicken but these were quite thick and created a chewy, almost gummy texture. Not a must have but worth trying.Hiza Nonkotsu (chicken knee) - 1/2 meat, 1/2 cartilage. Liked chicken skin more.Piri Kara Mune Niku (korean style - organic chicken breast topped with spicy red paste) - Very good. Didn't like it quite as much as the Japanese style, though. I liked Japanese BBQ better than Korean BBQ?....less a shock than chicken better than pork but still a bit surprising...Steak Skewer - Forgot the name but it was $4.50. Worth a skewer but not as standout as the chicken. Asparagus Bacon (asparagus wrapped in a slice of bacon) - The asparagus couldn't be crisper. The bacon couldn't be rarer and smokier. Yeah, this was good.Yaki Nasu Miso Dengaku (eggplant w/ miso paste) - Finally had good miso eggplant in NYC. The miso paste is perfect and the eggplant is cooked so it's more crispy than mealy. Me likey.For drinks, my shochu and fresh grapefruit juice was delicious - it was the first time I ever was handed a half grapefruit and a juicer and asked to add my own juice.Five stars...Yakitori Totto....I don't know if you're massaging those organic chickens like a Kobe beef cow or that's a crack rock you're grinding in the pepper grind but, whatever you're doing, keep doing it.",17,0.9993

Very elegant, old fashioned environment - beautiful carved wood, original windows, comfy armchairs and couches, a gorgeous long bar - and add to that various string instruments strumming delightfully. The crowd was older, being in our mid twenties, we were definitely the youngest in the place - but I liked that. There were alot of accents (British, Australian) and professorial types. It fit. At midnight-ish on a Fri night, it was populated; neither crowded full nor sparsely empty.It was a bit hard to find; it is NOT within the Grand Central Terminal as the info map indicates, it's on the street level a few doors down from the entrance to GCT, on Vanderbilt st.The hostess ushered us in welcomingly, despite our relatively casual attire (nice jeans and dressy tops, boots), and that seemed to be the uniform of the place - lots of jeans, blazers, and boots. Comfortable but not too casual.The drinks are damn pricey - $12-16 for cocktails, $10+ for wine - and I balked a bit at first. Their vintage cocktails did sound very intriguing, however, so my friend ordered the Robber Baron (rum, midori, lime juice, fresh mint) and I chose the Roaring Twenties (rum, ginger liqueur, grenadine, lemon juice) - at $13.50 a piece. These drinks though - we both heartily agreed they were WELL worth the price. My friend's midori-mojito was enormous and delicious; the midori is really an excellent touch. The ginger liquer in my drink was tasty and good for my queasy tummy; I don't really like rum, but I thoroughly enjoyed my well-balanced concoction. We estimate that each drink had AT LEAST the equivalent of 3 oz of 80 proof alcohol - quite possibly more - one drink each got us significantly buzzed and we both have high tolerances.

Instead, I'd like to tell you all a little story about the night that Pommes Frites broke my boyfriend's heart. (Cue the violin music, please.)It was a cold and blistery night on that New Year's Eve two years ago. My bf and I were hanging out with one of our couple friends who brought along their out-of-town guests, another couple. After a few live sets at one of those tragically hip East Village music bars, we ventured over to Sharaku for dinner, where we realized that we had very little in common with these out-of-towners. We were also slightly taken aback at their apprehension in trying most items on the menu - no seafood, nothing raw, just...vegetables? They do realize it's only Japanese food, right?Afterwards, we walked down Second Avenue and ended up at the Telephone Bar, where we continued to have very little to talk about....except for the awesome goodness of Pommes Frites, where we were determined to take everyone after a sufficient amount of alcohol had been consumed. It was going to be the one glimmer of hope in this evening of awkward conversation, our only salvation for delight and fun.So after my bf and I had talked it up a considerable amount, we finally made our way down to Pommes Frites...only to find that the metal gate was down and it was closed. And this is when I heard my bf's heart break. *Crrrracccckk*""What?! CLOSED?! How can it be closed?! It's New Year's Fuckin' Eve! Everyone's out and about getting their drink on, and everyone KNOWS that the best way to cap that night off is to indulge in some greasy, fatty fries dipped in a myriad of deliciously delectable sauces! What the #$@! Now what?!"" [I'm paraphrasing, of course.]I had never seen my bf so upset about food (or the lack of it) before. I wanted to comfort him, console him. But I didn't know how. He kicked the metal gate a few times, as if that would make the french fry friers (okay, technically Belgium) magically appear, but we all knew it was a lost cause. He cursed, he crossed his arms, he frowned. And we all watched as other New Year's Eve revelers came by only to face the same disappointment we did. It was a sad sight to see - a dozen or so drunk New Yorkers standing on the street, waiting and hoping it was just a trick of the mind.In the end, what could we really do? What we were looking forward to all night, our version of the ball dropping, had actually dropped the ball on us. I don't remember how we ended the night after that letdown...perhaps we had some pizza at the corner, or maybe we went for some more drinks. I think we just called it a night. A pitiful, disappointing, awkward night.Since then, my bf has forgiven Pommes Frites. How can he not? They're just too good to resist. But I think we learned our lesson on that fateful New Year's Eve: Don't ever start a night drinking in the East Village if you know you can't end it at Pommes Frites. And don't let your cool couple friends sucker you into hanging out with their weirdo couple friends on New Year's Eve.",11,0.9344

Here is where my cheap dad would load us up on food, then buy us one soda to share for all our hard work (we didn't know the difference back then and he now says we should have thanked him because none of us are fat LOL).About two months ago, I came by Red Hook to see what all the new buzz was about. I was totally impressed. Sure, it looks like shit (as usual), sure it's probably not the cleanest place on Earth, sure they allowed you other mongrels from other countries to represent the rest of South America, but for sure the food is still as good as it ever was.I was also surprised to find out that the city spent some money making the parks there look a little better.

2122,19,10,5.0,"For most people, karaoke is a simple endeavor where someone belts out a tune on a microphone while following along to the lyrics on screen. Japas has managed to turn this gimmick into a sophisticated, simplified one and combining the best in music variety, social conviviality, and affordability all rolled into one venue. It is easily one of the best karaoke venues in the city and deserves all of the high praise it can get.This particular Japas is the best of the 3 locations as I understand it. They have monster sized private rooms and a nice outside bar for folks who prefer to sing outside rather than amongst themselves. Each of the private rooms are spacious, utilize a functional layout so people can pass in and out freely, and tables are broken up so that people aren't having to revert back to one area like a coffee table. The sound system is fabulous with a powerful punch of bass while maintaining a crisp level of clarity. In the larger rooms, there are two screens, one in the front and back to allow folks to look wherever they need to without someone blocking the way. In addition, all the mics are wireless, which is a major plus. The music selection is about as diverse as I've seen with songs from around the world (Japanese, Chinese, English, Spanish, Tagalog, Korean, Vietnamese). For $30 a person, one can enjoy 2 hours of unlimited karaoke with a ton of bar food (chicken wings, sausage, french fries, egg rolls, chicken fingers) and sushi (california rolls, eel/advocado, salmon, tuna, spicy tuna, shrimp, etc) and UNLIMITED ALCOHOL (Sake, Sapporo, Asahi, Coors, Michelob, Rolling Rock, Budweiser, Corona, Heineken, Bass, House Wine, etc.). This deal is just too fantastic to pass up, especially when the food is actually good.My first time here was marred slightly by the fact I had several members of a party not show up, leaving the remaining folks to have to settle their portion of the bill. Service was gracious enough to neglect their portion and credit me another hour (by starting me later). They endured all of the indecisiveness of our group and really made the difference in our overall experience. They were fantastic and without a doubt I will be back again more times than I can count.",28,0.995

For 10 people, the tab was $70 per hour. We belted with fervor for three straight hours - which earned us a free fruit platter on the house. At the end of the night, when we were at the front counter to pay our dues, they brought out the old school Korean yogurt drinks which earned THEM some major brownie points.

2125,26,28,5.0,"Stephen Colbert shot me in the face.No really, here's how it went down:I went the night that Kucinich was on, and my god was the wait long. They packed the entire audience into the past-the-metal-detector-but-not-in-the-studio-yet room, where we waited. And waited. And waited. Then one of the crew came out and told us that they were doing something 'highly technical', and since Colbert is a perfectionist, they're rehearsing it heavily. And that we should be let in any minute now.So we waited. And waited. And waited a little more, packed in like very friendly sardines. And waited. Normally, i'd just have been irked about this, but since i broke a toe the day before, it was actually rather painful. And yes, it's my own damn fault i didn't pull the, 'i broke a toe, can i have your chair?' to one of the chair-sitters on the sides.Anyway, they eventually let us in. We sat, we dawdled, we listened to the rock music pumped in to deafen the audience to the workings of the cast and crew.Then, the warm up comic. Like the comic at The Daily Show, his primary source of 'humor' was making fun of audience members. He repeatedly told a guy sitting in front of me that he looked like the Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVey (or however that's spelled). That just wasn't amusing. He had some good lines, but since i bet he uses them every week, i won't repeat them here. I get that some people seem to think mean humor is funny, but i just don't.So, by around 6:45 (when i was supposed to be at a yelp Free Beer at 7), Colbert comes out. Yay! He did a Q&A, and wow, the charisma just pours of this guy. He can be my presidential candidate any day.After a round of apologies for the delay, and promises that the show will be hilarious, Stephen tugs on his WristStrong bracelet with an innocent, curious look. The crowd goes wild. Stephen starts pulling them from under his desk and shooting them into the crowd like rubber-bands.And now, as you've probably realized, this is where he shot me in the face. He wasn't aiming in my direction, so i wasn't paying attention, then one bracelet hit me on the cheek, like an inch below my eye. It stung a little, but the worst part was that it bounced off my face and the person behind me got it. Very sad.The show, well, if you're reading this you've probably seen it before, so you know how funny it is. I don't really need to bother much with that.And yes, even though Stephen Colbert shot me in the face, i give his show 5 stars. Sure, we waited for ever, but that doesn't seem to be the MO, so i won't deduct for that. And sure, he shot me in the face, but i doubt that happens too often either.

2127,17,3,5.0,"I'd brought a bunch of reading to the US Open, expecting to be bored. I was soooo wrong.For several years I've tolerated my tennis-obsessed husband using up all our Tivo space. Glancing at the occasional shot on our dinky TV, I never did grasp tennis's appeal beyond the hypnotically rhythmic tap-tap-tap. But this year's US Open was a revelation. Because almost all the courts were general admission, it was surprisingly easy to grab seats courtside (or very close).  When you're actually there, with balls hissing past you at 130-140 mph, while Greek Gods are sprinting and sliding and sweating and jumping and slamming the ball with tremendous force -- It's awesome!  We bought $138 ""Holiday Twilight"" passes, which covered Sat, Sun, and Mon nights of Labor Day weekend (mostly 3rd and 4th round matches). The passes gave us entry starting at 4pm to all the courts except Ashe, and reserved Ashe seats starting at 7pm - i.e. two Ashe matches each night. We took in more than 24 hours of tennis in all, about $5.75 an hour.  My top three matches: 3. Carlos Moya, at 31 the oldest player left in the US Open, won an epic, grueling 4-hour, 5-set match against Philip Kohlschreiber. The players' sheer stamina was impressive.  The match was so suspenseful that even folks in the neighboring Armstrong court were pressed against the rail, trying to catch a peek. My favorite moment? When we were courtside and Moya took his shirt off right in front of us. Pic: yelp.com/biz_photos/hU8t…2. This Latvian kid, Ernests Gulbis, came out of nowhere to destroy Tommy Robredo (the #8 guy in the world), with his 139mph serve and elegantly gentle drop shot. The grandstand crowd started sparse but got progressively bigger as spectators called and texted their friends, ""You've got to see this kid."" The woman behind us even exclaimed, ""I've just seen the future of tennis, and his name is Ernie!""  So cool to see a new talent arrive. Plus he looked exactly like Michael Cera of Superbad and Arrested Development. Endearing.1. Roger Federer played a beautiful match against Feliciano Lopez in the Round of 16. Lopez, a lefty, was terrific and actually won the first set. Federer won the second set 6-4 to tie the match, but Lopez was still playing extremely well. In the first game of the third set, Federer was down 0-40. My husband and all the other Federer fans around us were very tense indeed. But then Federer turned it ON. He won that game, and then, astonishingly, won the next 30 consecutive points on his serve. He was truly a joy to watch: so graceful yet powerful, and smart about his angles.  I saw him after twenty-something hours of watching other players work hard. But Federer, he glided around that court like he was from freakin Krypton. David Foster Wallace does not exaggerate: nytimes.com/2006/08/20/s… Tips: - If you can't decide between matches in the Grandstand and Armstrong Stadiums, sit in the last row of Armstrong. You can keep an eye on both courts from there.- Check out the Practice Courts, because you never know who you'll see. When we stopped by, Lopez was practicing for his Federer match. John McEnroe was also there, hitting balls with some kid. A couple dozen fans had gathered. When McEnroe's ball went out, the fans yelled ""Out! Out!"" McEnroe obligingly threw a fake tantrum and tossed his racket. Amusing. My only complaints are that ""USA! USA!"" chants can get tiresome (yes, James Blake fans, I'm talking about you), and that Ashe Stadium is simply too big. You have to be some sort of corporate titan to get anywhere near the 1st or 2d levels (where zillions of corporate seats remained empty despite having been ""sold out"").  But we proles still had fun in the nosebleeds. It was rowdy, and we could appreciate the angles better from up high.",18,0.9982

Like Babeland, formerly Toys in Babeland, my shops catered primarily to women, and furthermore, my shops were located in affluent suburbs of Washington, DC. If you think it's awkward for an NYC woman to buy a vibrator or a butt plug, try being a senator's wife. The best thing about sex is that it feels good when you do it. That said, imagine how sad it is when furthering the ""feel good, do it"" end is hampered by any one or more than one of the following:+bad lighting+careless or apathetic sales staff, if there are any+leering people of the same or opposite sex+tacky displays+inappropriate merchandising+nobody around who reminds you of YOU+lack of privacy+discomfort with the merchandise+lack of familiarity with the merchandise+dirty surroundingsThen imagine how nice it would be to examine, ask and otherwise familiarize yourself with any product, much less one that is going in, on or around you, all in perfect comfort, in nonjudgemental surroundings, with people who are actually trained, and enthusiastic about the fact that you want to dress up like a dominatrix and whip someone. Consentually. It's heaven. Believe me, being on the sales end is heaven, too. It's depressing how many people have crappy sex lives when all they need is a little encouragement and support. Adding some life to people's bedrooms where and when it is needed is nothing short of fulfilling life's work, and I really recommend it if you're looking for a career change.Babeland strives to meet all of their customer's needs. You can try things out--touch them, taste them, see and smell them. Handling is encouraged. It looks like a penis--so what? Grab on and feel how it vibrates, imagine it in your bedroom and head to the cash register. No need to be embarrassed. They know what you're doing with it, and they do it too. Babeland also offers many classes, lectures and talks on various sex and sexuality-related topics. Some are a little titillating, but most are informational and informative, and are real gems for those people looking to become more knowledgeable about some of the more outre pastimes people pursue in private. The most important thing to take away from your visit here is to remember that you're NOT the only person in the world who wants to do **insert kinky or benign sex act here**. If you were, stores like this wouldn't exist, and that little rubber toy you're about to buy wouldn't come in 12 colors, including sparkle and glow in the dark.",24,0.9811

I'm so impressed with most of the contestants on that show and Perilla is probably not going to be the only hit restaurant to come out of that show. OK... enough of a plug on the show. On to the restaurant review itself...I went to Perilla for my b-day dinner recently and had a fabulous meal.  The appetizers were very impressive. The four of us shared 3 different dishes and I loved all 3:- Raw yellowtail w/ cucumber salad, cilantro, tomato water & yuzu: very fresh yellowtail and a refreshing, slightly tangy / tart dressing - Crispy Berkshire pork w/ mushrooms: so delicious... esp the crispy parts- Spicy duck meatballs w/ yam gnocchi and topped w/ a raw quail egg: super good, love the bit of kick / spice in this dish... i'd say this is a must-have at PerillaI'd go back in a heartbeat for just these appetizers. But let's move on to main entrees. Here's what I got to try:- Grilled Colorado lamb w/ a parsnip mousse, red chard & tiny little onions: i should've gotten this medium-rare instead of medium but it was still super juicy and very nicely prepared... all the ingredients went so well together, even the parsnip mousse which i didn't think i'd care for- Roasted organic Chicken w/ asparagus, hazelnuts & apricot puree: very good for chicken but nothing I'd highly recommend, though my friend loved it- Whole grilled branzino: very simple preparation but a solid fish dish... huge portion; would recommend for 2 ppl to share with a side (i.e. farro risotto)We also had an awesome bottle of shiraz with our meal that we all really enjoyed. Wish i could remember the name! The desserts were pretty good (incl the delicious little oatmeal raisin cookies that came w/ our check) but not super memorable. But I think that had alot to do w/ the fact that I was really full and not really paying too much attention to the few bites of dessert I had.The only minor complaints that I was thinking about taking away a star for was the slowed down service towards the end of our meal and the somewhat insipid interior. Don't get me wrong, the place is designed well and I like the narrow dining layout and love the round banquette tables nested in the booths lining one side of the wall. But overall, it wasn't anything all that impressive. However, I am not subtracting any stars since the focus here is on the food. After all, Harold D is a chef (a ""Top Chef"", no less!), not an interior designer... hmm, maybe next season's Top Chef winner should hook up with the winner of Top Design, and waiter outfits can be designed by the winner of Project Runway!

Being Memorial Day Weekend and on such short notice, my expectations for finding a rental at a reasonable rate was pretty low. I have been working on some artwork lately that requires the use of a car pretty often and a few people suggested Zipcar. My constant wanderlust and growing impatience with New York convinced me that Zipcar might be the right idea. Signing up was easy easy easy. The online form takes just a few minutes to fill out, and I got approved (they check your driving history) within 24 hours. Picked up my Zipcard on Tuesday and logged onto the site to make a reservation, nervous that I wouldn't be able to get a car. Not a problem! Many cars available at different times. I booked 2 Mini Coopers, for Wed and one for Friday-Saturday with no problems. This morning I went to pick up the car and again- no problems. The car (like most Zipcars in NYC, i think) was in a parking garage. No forms to fill out, nothing to sign, no exchanging of anything, it was super easy. I felt like i was stealing something. I ran my errands, took a long pleasant whiff of freshly cut grass out in the suburbs, and dropped the car back off at the parking garage with the same amount of ease. Wow, how could anything in this city be so easy?! I'm looking forward to Friday. The only downside-- it was TOO easy.

The majority of the seating is at a long bar which was staffed by 60mph moving, ridiculously friendly people. But to the business end... The lobster roll was very buttery, but had the golden ratio of lobster : mayonnaise (which in my mind is about 892 : 1). The fries were a bit thicker than the two aforementioned institutions, but crispy throughout and well salted. The pickles were a little surprising. They were crinkle cut like Ruffle's potato chips and had a brownish hue (which in NYC I generally associate with the East River) and yet had this delicious vinegar and peppercorn mix on them. Oh and did I mention that I was sitting next to Danny Meyer (yeah... Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern and 11 Madison Park Danny Meyer) and he liked it too.

I'm sure that's not the first time that's been said in the West Village.I went out tonight to meet my friend Dennis who I hadn't seen for over a year, and I recommended that we try Piccolo Angolo. From all that I read here on Yelp I knew that we were going to have a a great dinner. I got there before meeting my friend to scope it out about 8:00. It was packed. I asked if they would be able to accommodate two, which seemed to amuse the host. He informed me that they only take reservations. The only thing he had open for the rest of the night was a 9:30. I took it thinking that we probably would dine elsewhere.I met Dennis at 8:30 and we decided to try to get into Bar Pitti. We got their a little before 9:00 and it was its regular zoo. They told us that it would be a half hour wait. Since it was would be about the same we decided to take a slow walk back and use the reservation at Piccolo Angolo. When we arrived we were promptly seated. To start we shared the Stuffed Mushrooms (stuffed with ground pork) and we both ordered the Linguine Con Polpette (Meatballs) for main. The mushrooms were a refreshingly different take on the dish. Usually they have more breadcrumbs than I like. These didn't appear to have any. When the Linguine with Meatballs arrived we were both shocked. There were two and they were sized somewhere in between a baseball and a softball. I joked with the waiter, ""I asked for the large meatballs"" I said. He smiled, probably for the 50th time that night, from the same joke.This dish was perfect. The meatballs were delicious.

2138,16,17,5.0,"The sport of cycling is in a shambles, and we need a few strong legs, a couple of sturdy wheels and a clean urine test to restore America's dignity and allow us to compete in the Tour de France. If you are as tired as I am of watching the utterly painful, and interminable public unraveling of shamed Tour de France loser, Floyd Landis (the only person I can think of in modern athletics who has blamed the presence of synthetic testosterone in his bloodstream on everything from bourbon to a French conspiracy against him), then it's time to act! The bike path inside Prospect Park offers a great introductory course in cycling...not too rigorous, and ripe with plentiful glimpses of the majestic park for the hardworking cyclist to admire in passing. Of course, as any good cycling course should, Prospect Park's bike path has a few endurance obstacles that will challenge a good cyclist to kick their pedals into high gear and elevate their game. There's one hill in particular (it's about 3/4 of the way through the path if you start at the Garfield Street entrance) that is likely responsible for many strained calf muscles and asthma attacks. Once I reach it, I usually have to stop for a few moments before making my ascent so that I can mentally prep myself. Avid cyclists would likely scoff at my difficulty reaching the apex of a hill they'd regard as a mere bump in the road. Personally, I find the climb much less agonizing if I can somehow distract myself for the duration of it. The most effective technique has been an imagined scenario whereby a pack of hungry wallaby's escapes from the Prospect Park Zoo and follows me up the hill in vigorous pursuit of some delicious leaves tucked into my back jeans pocket. Their salivating little wallaby mouths violently snap at my posterior as I pedal for dear life. This works...I swear. There's nothing scarier than a small animal with a big appetite!Cycling enthusiast or not, the Prospect Park bike path has something for even the most novice of riders. Me? I'm firmly in the novice camp since I haven't rode my bike in Prospect park in over 3 years. It's the wallaby's, man. They hold a grudge :(",15,0.793

They have great drink specials, like the ""Frat Boy"" and the ""Sportsman"".This is where I discovered that one can mix vanilla vodka and orange soda and end up with a seriously delicious drink that is so easy to consume that if you're not careful when you re-create it at home, you'll make all your underweight girl friends barf.

They have everything from Neutral Milk Hotel to the Misfits, with Hank Williams and T.Rex in between.

2141,13,22,5.0,"Valhalla is apparently the name of the hall from Scandinavian mythology for slain heroes. It's also a pretty catchy name for one of NYC's best beer snob bars. On a rainy Saturday with a couple of hours to kill, I spent some time in a nearly empty Valhalla and immediately took a liking to the place. There were 30 imported and craft beers on tap, with 12 of them being from Belgium. I opted for a Karmeliet Trippel and a Corsendonk Brown, both of which were served in the proper type of glass. As others mentioned, a super-hot, but very knowledgeable female bartender was working that day. Two large TVs were showing a baseball game with the sound muted, which was a nice touch for those of us who don't watch baseball and don't particularly care for the sound of yammering announcers talking about batting averages to cloud our enjoyment of snobby Belgian ales. In keeping with its rather classy atmosphere, Valhalla offers flights of beers, something I've never seen before. For a very reasonable price, you get a selection of beers with a theme (Belgium, Around the World, etc.)The guy next to me ordered a Budweiser.A BUDWEISER.This is about like going to Peter Luger's and instead of ordering a steak, asking for a nice can of Spam, or just asking if you could instead lick the floor of the kitchen with your tongue.

We went through the entire wine list glass by glass... tasting and swirling and discussing the beautiful Alsacian white. The bartenders were top-notch, albeit a bit smug, but I suppose I would be snug if I had that sort of bartending job, too. The food was divine. The carrot and calamari salad was delicately tossed with an intriguing meyer lemon vinaigrette which smelled acidic with notes of wasabi. The corn soup was a rich, heavenly blend of sweet corn, cream and oyster mushrooms topped with smoky bacon shavings. This soup was so good I just want to bathe in it. That good.For our second course, we had the fontina stuffed meatball over a potato puree which was great. I wouldn't say it is the best meatball I have ever had, but I think that is due in part to the recent New York City meatball craze of 2006-2007. The pork chop was stunning. This was one of the most flavorful pieces of meat I have eaten this year. Plump and fork-tender, smoky, succulent and without a doubt meaty, this was plated on a warm zucchini and served with crisp haricot vert. It was perfection. Ugh.

2146,22,27,5.0,"Anyone who knows me knows that 50% of my waking hours is spent inside a public library. It's not that I read. I do, but not as much as my time spent in libraries would indicate. It's because I'm poor and cheap and I try to make up for it by feeding off of public resources as much as I can. And really, the NYPL is a glorious system. Why would anyone RENT a video from Blockbuster when you can place it on hold and get it at the library for FREE? In any case, Jefferson Market is one of the more unique libraries among the NYPL system. It's decked with stained glass windows, has a very cool spiral staircase, and houses quite a neat collection of materials. Having come here regularly now for about a year and a half, I've picked up a few things. For example, the security lady does this thing. The library opens at 12 on most days...and usually around 11:55, there will be a group of people waiting outside (we have no social lives, it's true). She will not open the doors until the clock chimes at 12. This is observed STRICTLY. She will stand there and jingle her keys, as if saying, ""haha, look at the power I hold over thee, you lowly creatures,"" with this smirk on her face. I've gotten used to this by now and I usually show up around 11:55 just for the show. It's quite amusing and she's actually really nice once you get to know her. I've also become a ""regular"" here. So if I'm MIA for a week, someone will inevitably say, ""haven't seen you in awhile."" This is not a good thing. Because once they get to know you, they will want to talk to you, and then all sorts of things can develop. One time, I was here, and the guy says to me, ""ah, you have one item overdue...would you like me to renew it?"" Me: thinking *I don't remember having anything overdue, what's he talking about?* I give him a quizzical look. ""It looks like you have 'Alternatives to Sex' overdue?"" Alternatives to Sex. Now. I remember. Having realize what that title might imply (it was actually a contemp. fiction novel; quite a good read), my face immediately goes red, but I try to play it cool. ""Oh right. Yes, please do renew that."" Then, he says, ""you also have items here on hold for you."" So he goes into the backroom and takes out whatever I have on hold. As he scans out a dvd I placed on hold for a film study thing, I notice that the cover for it is quite explicitly sexual. (How come I don't remember this cover when I placed a hold on it???) He does not look at me, but by now probably thinks of me as extremely sexually repressed or some such odd thing. But again, I play it cool. ""Great, thanks a lot,"" I say with utter normality. Only to bump into a bookcase on the way out and dropping everything on the floor, thus making a scene, as I usually do, and casting more unwanted attention to myself. I have inadvertently made myself out to be The Awkward Girl here. But in all seriousness, I highly recommend this branch; if you need some quiet time to study/read/do nothing for an entire day, there are plenty of comfy tables and chairs.",18,0.9933

Food was excellent, wine was perfectly paired, and the atmosphere was lively. Oooohhh, and I tried a third of the menu. Always a plus. And lemme just say to the fishes harmed in the making of my meal - be proud, be honored, because you, my little fishy friends, are part of something special. Something that other fish can only dream of.For starters, or as the Crave people like to say, what you order before your order - I tried the spicy yellow fin tuna set on top of planched seared yucca with a lime butter ceviche. Man, that was good. Tender tuna. Creamy yucca. You really just have to try it. I also tried the traditional shrimp ceviche with charred corn and hearts of palm in a cilantro and fresh lime ceviche. Well, of course, that was just excellent. And when they say charred corn, they actually mean ancho spiced popcorn. As my friend put it, ""I had to get the traditional ceviche. It comes with popcorn!"" Well said. They also had oysters on special, in a tomato and young ginger sauce. Didn't actually taste one, but my fellow eater's eyes rolled into the back of her head. I think that's a good sign.Entrees came next. I had the artic char with truffles (i totally just said truffles), strawberries and caviar in a champagne and sea salt ceviche. It sounds interesting doesn't it? I was a bit skeptical but I had to try it. Champagne and truffles? You might as well offer me some crack with my meal. It was amazing. I mean, really. Amazing. As Ron Burgundy would say: ""By the beard of Zeus!"" It was that good. Also got to try the kona kampachi with curried chickpeas, cucumber and green mango in a mint, yogurt and fresh lemon ceviche. Also very tasty. I may have had some trouble spearing the chickpeas with my fork but that's just because I'm slightly retarded when I'm hungry.Also tried the pupusa with spicy florida red snapper slaw with naam pla, lime juice and kalamanzi ceviche. I'm not usually a fan of snapper but it was quite good in this dish. Really, it was the perfect summery dish - a heaping mound of citrusy cole slaw over flat bread.My friend also had the filet mignon slider with manchego cheese, house made sour cream and chive potato chips in a worcestershire sauce and lemon juice ceviche. There was more eye rolling. I had a chip. It was tasty.We only tried one of their sides. The grilled red corn with queso blanco. Well, I had it. And I didn't share. It's not that I'm selfish, it's just that it's, well, corn on the cob. Really not easy to share with others. And to be honest, I don't think I could've shared it. I love cheese on my corn, and when there's a sizeable layer covering the corn and it tastes like heaven, I'm just lucky I don't eat the cob itself.To drink, I had the Las Brisas wine and it was described well on the menu - peachy and floral. By the second carafe, I may not have noticed the peach as much, but again, a personal issue having to do with lack of self control. Others had the white sangria which looked refreshing and delicious. Unfortunately, they don't serve cocktails, but I think you can get pretty toasty despite their lack of a liquor license.Our waiter had a touch of the ADD. But, to be fair, there were a lot of shiny things in the place. And, when he could bring himself back to paying attention to us, he was quite funny. I learned that: 1) the filet mignon slider is much better than white castle sliders, 2) that the kampachi is flown in from Hawaii every day but that it does not fly itself, people do that, and 3) that my crewneck sweater was, indeed, too provocative. All excellent insights.The space is a bit cramped. There's really only room for maybe 20 people in the whole place, and out of those 20, only about 6 can sit at a table. The rest are relegated to sitting at the bar, which is arranged similar to a sushi bar. I thought it was quaint, but I definitely wouldn't suggest taking a large number of people here. And, it's quite expensive. All that stuff I listed up there? That was for 3 of us. Mmm hmm... 3. I'm not even going to tell you how much I paid, all I will say is that it was worth it.So, we get the bill, right? And guess what comes with it? Free dessert. This amazing frozen spicy chocolate something (ice cream mebbe?) with flavors of caramel mixed in - UNFREAKINGBELIEVABLE. I can see why they put it in such a small bowl.

My favorite is the pork belly hot pot-- mMMMmmmMmmm. .. though it is a little on the saltier side.All this can be washed down with good sake (glass or box), cocktail, flavored soju and beer (not necessarily all at once). The service here is attentive, though they do get busy during prime dinner hours. There may be a wait between 5-8pm, especially if you have a larger group. Otherwise, this is also a great place for singleton dining. All in all, it's a fantastic find and the price tag is reasonable. I ended up leaving here with a tummy full of food (and leftovers to go) and a warm fuzzy feeling from all the sakes,... ahh- how I miss that feeling now sitting alone in my cube.*not true for my tummy",8,0.9928
2155,29,28,5.0,"In the ongoing hunt for the perfect falafel in NYC, Cafe Rakka makes the short list. The catalyst for me joining yelp was to defy the recent spate of sub-5-star reviews this place has received. Most recently, my own sister trashed them. I blame her flawed perception on the drugs.To be fair, I haven't been in a while, but it used to be that no matter where I was in the city, Cafe Rakka was worth the travel time. Rakka was a standby place to bring a girl for a getting to know you inexpensive city date. Bad falafel does not get you laid and this place came through for me.On one such outing with a girl to Cafe Rakka, we ordered 2 falafel sandwiches. She replied ""no thank you"" to the gruff ""hot sauce?"" Of course I told the guy i wanted hot sauce on mine. He stops stuffing the pitas, looks me in the eye and says ""I know your sandwich."" My date looked at me like a celebrity. Cafe Rakka knows my goddamn sandwich.On to the food. The falafel is not always the same, it varies depending on who makes it. You can make requests (toast the pita slightly on the grill, let the balls get a little crispier, etc.) since these are usually made to order unlike a production line like Mamoun's where they practically hand you a falafel as you walk in the door and move you along.The salad and tomatoes are fresh and the falafel balls are crispy and well spiced. The optional hot sauce, as always, is essential. unlike anywhere else I've been, they mix the hot sauce in with the strata of ingredients, so you don't get all the hot bites at the top. As with any good, well-sauced falafel, you will want to slowly peel back the wrapper as you are eating so as to avoid getting tahini on the crotch of your pants. Tahini crotch invariably makes you look like a sex criminal.During busy hours, out on the counter, they used to leave a free plate of deep fried skinny pita bread slices. They are spiced with sumac, a tangy powder made of dried, crushed, deep red berries. You can order it from the menu (pita bread sticks) for like 2$ and you get enough to share. These are a great accompaniment to a falafel sandwich and are better than any fries you have had, especially when they come out of the frier all crispy and almost burning you.A side of fava bean salad is also good, especially if you ask them to drizzle a little tahini on it. Their hummus is good and has a strong taste of cumin. I add cumin to store bought hummus now.",28,0.9867
2156,27,49,5.0,"Indulge me, if you will, for a story. A story of fatness.My roommate and I used to have a tradition called Fat Sunday in which every Sunday night, we'd order obscene amounts of Chinese take-out and watch Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy (back when they were on at the same time...sigh...oh the memories). One night we had some people joining us, and we decided to switch up the fatness and order something different. In our huge stack of take-out menus we found Empanada Mama, and thought, hey, why not.Now, there weren't all that many of us, (maybe 4?) but we ordered A LOT of empanadas. I mean, a lot. So many that we decided when the delivery guy arrived we would yell something like ""Hey guys! The food's here!"" back to imaginary people in our bedrooms so that he wouldn't think we were total fat-asses for ordering something like 24 empanadas for 4 people - yup, that's 6 per person. We call it Fat Sunday for a reason, people! But here's the rub (and the fat). We ordered so many so that we could try as many flavors as possible (and, of course, to be as fat as possible), but they left out one flavor, leaving us four empanadas short. We paused. Clearly we had plenty of empanadas (this loss put us down to what, 20?) but we had paid for all of them and wanted to try all the flavors. Should we admit true obesity and call back and demand yet MORE empanadas. Yes, damn it! It's Fat Sunday! So we did, and they obliged promptly. And were they delicious, hot, cheap, and oh-so-fat? You betcha. A great little place to stop for some fried latino goodness and not do any damage to your wallet. Unfortunately I can't say the same for your waistline.",25,0.9829

2159,9,4,5.0,"Ahhh there is nothing like torturing your body like swimming, biking, and running all in the same day. I just finished my second NYC triathlon and living in San Francisco this has become my destination triathlon each year. My wife who doesn't compete also wins by spending the whole week in NYC seeing museums and shopping. The distances: Olympic Distance Tri, 1 mile swim, 25 miles biking, 6 miles running.The swim: A point to point swim in the Hudson River!! Doesn't sound appealing at first but the river isn't that bad. The swift currents makes anyone a fast swimmer so your mile PR'S (personal record) are easy to achieve. The only problem is the last 100 meters the waters are shallow and the river bottom is kind of tarry, so it is suggested to try to swim all the way. If you're a bad swimmer, just let the currents take you downstream.The Bike: A 25 mile trek up the West Coast Hwy with appox 2200 feet of total climbing. It's a fun rolling course with river views, and downhill straightaways. The last turnaround you get a view of the NYC skyline. The Run: The first mile you have 72nd street all to yourself and the run is very surreal. People line the streets to cheer you on. The course then takes you to Central Park and you run a big loop around Central Park. It's very cool to finish the race there.Once you finish, the racers are treated like VIP kings. Free food, drinks, tee shirts, caps, wet ice cold towels and a medal. There is even a tent with Swedish Masseuses students who give 30-45 mins FREE massages. The race is very organized and professional. It's neat to see some of the world class athletes racing with you. It is timed using a computer chip so loved ones can receive text messages of your progress. There is even a 10 second video of yourself that gets sent to you at the finish line.The Bad: NYC can be hot and humid during July so the racing conditions can be hard. I cramped up both years during the run portion but I did finish.All and all an enjoyable event which I plan to do each year, gives my wife and I an excuse to visit NYC!",9,0.9955

2162,13,8,5.0,":::Choir of angels:::Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!It's here, on little tiny Jones Street. The best damn meal you have had in ages, served without pomp, circumstance or pretense, in clean, simple, unfussy surroundings. I know. How hard should it be to find seasonal American fare that doesn't require the sale of a kidney or come with a side order of supercilious? Not hard at all, now that Harold Dieterle and his crack team of sincere foodloving staff are ensconced in this gem of a restaurant. Where to begin? Well, look, I watched ""Top Chef"" and I was a huge Harold fan. His food always looked like food I wanted to make and eat myself. The restaurant delivers exactly the kind of food you would expect him to create: genuine, well-prepared, creative and traditional, all at the same time. Looking forward to coming here tonight was a wonderful anticipation, and for once, the reality exceeded my expectations. We began with a drink at the comfortable bar. We had reservations for 6:45 but we got there early to relax. The bartender (I can't remember her name, was it Erin? ) recommended several wines to me, allowed me to try them all, and then Jamie the maitre'd came by to offer her suggestion. Jamie lives in our building so I took her seriously, since if she made a bad choice for us, I would give her what for in the elevator. I went with a lovely Tempranillo, because I wanted to have lamb, a Museum Real from Spain, well priced at $9 a glass. Silky, velvety and richly fruity, it was a wonderful start to the evening. Peter had a Lagavulin which was quite overpriced at $20. When seated, we listened to our server and Jamie while deciding. We had read all the reviews, including the Times review, which they were all somewhat disappointed with, and we both had items we wanted to try. I began with the Berkshire pork belly ($10) and Peter had the duck meatballs served with a quail egg ($10).  We didn't think the meatballs were that memorable, but they were tasty. The pork belly was an enormous cloud of meaty fat, perched upon mushrooms and braised greens which cut the overwhelming richness of the belly, which was enhanced by a vanilla gastrique which was very nicely done and understated. The portion was so large and the belly was so porky and rich that I was unable to finish. Which was sad!For main dishes, Peter ordered the skate wing with pastrami and cabbage ($24, I think), and I got the Colorado lamb chops and breast served with parsely root mousseline and cippolini onions ($29). The skate was easily one of the best, most imaginative and yet traditional dishes I have had in recent memory. The pastrami enhanced the delicate skate and the cabbage supported the unusual texture in the most remarkable ways--I can't say enough about it, and the portion was enormous. My lamb was perfectly cooked, with the breast meat richly shredded in the greens of my dish, and the onions providing a savory,slightly sweet accompaniment to the gamy lamb. The only letdown was the parsely root mousseline, which really did nothing at all for the dish, due to the nonexistent taste. I was disappointed that it didn't work because I think it was a good idea. We also ordered a side of faro risotto. This had to be one of the best dishes I have ever had. Faro is like a wheat berry...chewy, dense, nutty and a wonderful texture when chewed. This risotto was simply divine. Artichokes, soft as puppy ears, dotted this garlicky, creamy, parmegiany pot of savory goodness. It's topped with some grapes, which we ignored, since we don't like sweet with savory.Service was friendly, eager, warm and genuine. Bread was whole grain and delicious, served with a green, fruity, grassy olive oil and a tiny wooden ramekin of salt. Water came with reckless abandon and plentitude. The bathrooms were cute, albeit small. The manager strode up and down the narrow restaurant constantly, asking whether everything was to our liking, asking if I needed more wine, folding napkins and overseeing a very well-run dining room. The hum of satsified diners and the well-chosen music provide enough noise to be animated but you won't find yourself straining to hear your companion.We were simply too full to have dessert, but they looked and sounded lovely. Harold was too busy to come out and say hi, but given the care and effort laid bare on every plate, I was happy to hear it. This is a wonderful place to come for a nice evening meal on a regular basis if you live nearby, and it is good enough and refreshingly honest enough to make a point to come here even if you live out of town. There were several families with kids there when we visited, and for nice, well-behaved kids, this is a great place, because the food isn't ""weird"" or overly presented. Note, I said nice kids. Don't bring a screamer here, please.  The prices are a hair under what you would expect them to be, and the food is quite delicious. Well done!",21,0.9995

And their bun won't get all soggy and fall apart in your hands. Not that there's anything wrong with licking your fingers clean, I just dislike soggy bread...3) ""Mini"" size for those with undersized stomachs (or for those gluttons who want a burger with their mac and cheese)4) Mac & cheese - amazingly rich, plenty of gruyere cheese and bacon, and perfectly browned on top. A must try.Cons1) I think the place holds a total of 20-22 people, so at peak times, expect to wait. A long time. Delivery takes a while (45 mins - 1 hour at peak times). Pick-up is a good option (15-20 mins)2) The onion rings - batter is too bready and there's too much of it. Fries are better, but occasionally over-fried.3) Salad (alternative to fries and onion rings) is a little uninspired - some mixed greens and dressing - no other veggies mixed in for texture or anything.

2164,12,2,5.0,"generally i don't bother to write reviews for places that have been reviewed this many times already, because usually i don't have much to say that hasn't been said before. but on this occasion, i have a few items to point out:1. i don't understand why everyone is complaining that this museum is so difficult to navigate! it's really not, i promise you. admittedly i've been going to the brooklyn museum for my entire life, but any art museum as full as this one is going to be a bit overwhelming on your first visit. do you really think the Met is any easier to navigate when you're there for the first time?2. the brooklyn museum is, as far as i know, the only museum that has visible storage facilities, which are AMAZING (you can find them on the top floor, off of the permanent collection.) the museum's renovations a few years ago were not limited to the entrance, and they added this visible storage facility because such a small portion of any museum's collection is ever on display at one time. it's a climate-controlled room filled with glass cases, and densely packed in those cases is so much artwork -- paintings, sculpture, furniture, pewter pieces, there's even a bicycle. there are also computers throughout the room so you can look up more information on a piece you like, using its catalog number because the cases are so full that there isn't even room for labels identifying each piece.3. let us not forget the battle with giuliani in 1999 when the brooklyn museum a) hosted the Sensations exhibit, despite the controversy that came with it (it was called Sensations for a reason), and b) continued to host the exhibit even when people protested and giuliani threatened to take away the museum's city funding. they held strong, in the name of art and freedom of speech, and i will always admire them for it.",9,0.9769
2165,18,16,5.0,"There are plenty of reviews that have been written canonizing this pizza. And a few that provide the inevitable backlash/contrarian view to combat all the hype. This review aims to use the elements of the Di Fara experience as ingredients towards a larger contemplation of man's quest for perfection - consider it an homage to Dom's attempt to honor his fantastic ingredients via his pizza-making.....except with infinitely more pretentiousness (extra cheese?) and infinitely less virtuosity (canned sauce).""What is the price of perfection?"" I ponder during my long wait for receiving one man's (a spry, near septuagenarian Dom Demarco) attempt at creating perfection within an edible 15 inch circle of tomato, cheese(s), and dough. Now this isn't my initial thought, mind you. I entered with my heart a-thumpin' as I finally found myself at the oft-proclaimed best pizzeria in New York. My initial thoughts vacillate between: 1) an internal loop of ""I'm gonna have Di Fara pizza"" that resembles both Eddie Murphy's old ""I have some ice cream"" stand-up bit and commercial pleadings of cartoon dogs for Snausages and Kibbles & Bits2) concern over whether the wait will drive the rest of my family crazy (My cousin had a party about 2 miles away and, after hearing how excited I was about the pizza, my mom, dad, 2 sisters, and sister's fiancee decide to join me in the experience).These pragmatic concerns are taken care of by the key decision (after 30 minutes of waiting) to take 6 slices (1 for each of us) in lieu of our first pie (I had ordered a 2nd pie to go). The slice was great but too complex to make any grand assessment of it. I'm left longing for another slice as I bid adieu to my family who head back to the land of malls and hair spray (NJ).As I wait for my pie to go, I start to take in my surroundings. There's nothing fancy or romantic about the place - the only thing distinguishing it vs other northeastern pizza joints are the various framed articles touting Di Fara. (Not that other pizza places don't toot their own horn - if I had a nickel for every pizza box I've seen with the 'You've tried the rest. Now try the best' line. At least Di Fara employs third-party assessments...). But this place is different in two key ways:1) There isn't a dough-slinger or chef behind the counter - there's an artisan. You can tell it in the way Dom grates the buffalo mozzarella onto each pie (vs. having the bucket of grated mozzarella cheese to sprinkle on). Or the way he chops basil and grates another type of cheese (grana padana) to top off the finished pie as classical music plays in the background.        2) There isn't a line of customers waiting for a pie or some slices. There is chaos. Perhaps due to naivete, I pictured the wait for a Di Fara pie to be a communal experience. People bonded together for one common objective --- sharing a mutual respect...yadda yadda yadda. But I'm not seeing a lot of that. Whatever positive motivations everyone brought to the pizzeria have all but disappeared thanks to the long wait and the infuriating lack of an equitable ordering system. And it's this yin/yang battle separated by a pizza counter that gets me thinking about the price of perfection. Watching Dom apply his craft is a treat and I can only hope he finds inner peace and tranquility in it. But the desperation, conflict, and opportunism (people try and often succeed at getting their pie before others) on the other side of the counter feel like a microcosm of other quests for perfection. Blood diamonds (perfect jewel). Ethnic cleansing (perfect race), Enron (perfect scam). Steroids (perfect male body). Eating disorders (perfect female body), The unnecessary zaniness that Balky inflicted on Cousin Larry (perfect strangers), etc. Is the quest for perfection - even one much more noble than all the above examples - ever worth the cost?After probably 60 minutes of such philosophizing (on top of the earlier 30 minutes), I finally get my pie and can find out whether the pizza truly is worth it. The first slice is fantastic. The interplay of the two cheeses has such a sharp, rich taste to it. The San Marzano tomatoes taste so rustic and earthy. The basil complements both the cheese and tomatoes. The crust has a great char to it. It's like no slice I've had before. Another slice confirms the assessment --- this could very well be the best pizza I've ever had.But I'm still not totally satisfied. I don't know if it was the hype, the wait, self-inflicted nihilism or a bit of all three but this odyssey didn't end up being about a search for the best pizza --- it became about a search for the perfect pizza. And perfection is too much to ask of anyone - even Dom.",17,0.9989

These are the big ol' brioche shaped like crowns, not some dinky crap brioche you've been conditioned to accept as normal.Besides a decent cup of coffee, this is pretty much all they sell. There are three people working in a coffin-sized newsstand--but they certainly keep busy with all the brioche-hungry patrons. They were really nice to me.

Get in a cab to meet friends on the lower east side. When cab driver asks where to go I say ""I don't know!"" Cab driver pulls over until I call my friend and figure it out. Cab driver continues. I wonder if cab rides are always so bumpy and nauseating. Get to the lower east side, realize I have no money, run out to use an ATM, throw up. My boyfriend sees me, realizes I am not fit to socialize, gets back in the cab with me and proceeds to take me back to Williamsburg. I wonder if the Williamsburg bridge is always so bumpy and nauseating. Roll down the window and THROW UP WITH MY HEAD OUT THE WINDOW as we are going over the bridge. Cab driver is pissed. Boyfriend is pissed. I am drunk. Go home. Pass out. Wake up with massive hangover. This, to present date, is my drunkest evening ever in New York.Intermission: Summer 2006.

This generation has not yet forsaken us"", he told me that I was a bit early and if I wanted to wait for the rest at the main exhibition hall. I nodded and was led to the hall right in front of the entrance.... I was alone; books were displayed on glass display cases, and it was a book cover exhibition; various rare and on occasion, unique editions of strange types of covers made with many different materials (metal, carved wood, plaster, etc....) the visual effect was stunning, and I could only wonder what the contents of those book might've been. The class arrived. We could get the elevator to the third floor or climb the elegant staircase. I chose the latter; up I went and saw paintings of famous book collectors, writers, and other ppl who surely were notables on the history of the Grolier Club and Books. The second floor houses a library and another exhibition hall and hallway; we had our class in one of these cozy studies, filled with old and rare books, and a cart in the corner with coffee and water. I felt right at home. We were then told the history of the Grolier Club. Founded on 1884, it is the biggest and oldest society for bibliophiles and book collectors; members are allowed to donate their collections to the Grolier Club post mortem, and enjoy many privileges, such as the use of the collections, libraries and premises at large; although they told us that the main exhibition hall is open to the public as well. We got to meet the chairman of the Grolier Club, one of the curators and other notable members; and they all had this incredibly chipper attitude, totally peaceful, educated, candid and humorous.

A truly special experience, that I loved.Located above Ito En tea shop (review pending), Kai has a very zen-like environment. With green tea leaves infused and incense burning, you are immediately calmed and feel soothed. The hostess was warm and friendly - what a great way to enter a restaurant. We are immediately presented with hot towels to clean our hands. You can either order from Kai's a la carte menu or go with one of their omakase chef tasting menus. Of course, we go with the large tasting menu, which takes about two hours to complete. We told our server we had to leave by nine to meet with friends, and she was very cognizant of it during our whole meal. We had the Ryuko Junmai Dai Gingo sake, which was very smooth. Our tasting included:Homemade tofu and sea urchin - I never knew how fantastic homemade tofu was. So soft and creamy, it went perfectly with the sea urchin.Marinated vegetables in a ponzu vinaigrette - came with zucchini, carrot, asparagus, tomato, and pearl onions. A fresh palette cleanser.Traditional clear soup with flying fish roe quenelle - This dish had almost a matzoh ball texture, but better! The broth was amazing!Sashimi - Blue fin tuna directly from Japan, shrimp, Hawaiian Komaru and Long Island fluke.  Blue fin tuna was by far the best piece of sashimi I've ever had (Have not been to Japan yet).Soft shell crab and avocado wrapped in rice paper with tomoato and shichimi togarashi relish - very good warm dish. Crunch of the crab and creaminess of avocado go very well together.Broiled red snapper with Japanese raw ginger.Traditional Japanese flounder tempura, eggplant with ponzu sauce.Waygu beef with fried white asparagus served with homemade sweet barbeque sauce. This is what all beef should taste like... seriously. Soba noodles in oolong tea broth with wasabi and green onion - BEST soba I've EVER had.

2186,18,6,5.0,"when i was in europe- my friends took me to Maoz in Barcelona. i was so in love with the place, i was loathing NYC for not having a Maoz! even with a recent trip to London & Paris this past fall, i visited Maoz in both cities. then in December '06- on my way to Barca (now closed!)... the small pizzeria closed down and was under construction. what did i see under the ""Coming Soon"" sign? Maoz vegetarian!!so, i've been waiting in anticipation since December for the fabulous buffet-style salad bar with their famous falafels to make an appearance in March. i've never tasted a falafel ball so delicious before! it's not greasy and hard (from over frying), the spices and ingredients are complimentary to each other, and it's soft enough to instantly melt in your mouth as you devour the pita sandwich. it comes with veggies inside already- but you get to load up on the salad bar with any sandwich/eggplant/hummus salad you purchase.with no further introduction... this is my first experience in Maoz of NYC:located conveniently on Union Square East (across the park) next to Children's Place, Trevi Deli, Wine & Liquor store, and Zen Palete... it's a small but pretty noticeable place on the block. The neon-green & white patterned wallpaper is the first thing you'll notice as you walk by Maoz. there's a small table/stool area for chowing down inside- but it gets pretty hot, crammed, and busy in there. you're instantly greeted by a small but fully loaded salad bar. i was the only person inside the restaurant at the time- the cashier immediately struck up a conversation with me as i'm admitted to him i've been waiting for this to open for months!!! my mouth is watering as i'm reading the menu- i should know what i am supposed to order! i'm an experienced Maoz customer! not the case... i was too happy and excited that i forgot the whole menu. i ended up with a Junior Meal Deal (in europe it's called the Small Meal and 4.20 pounds) for $6.75. it comes with a soft drink of your choice (or fresh juice for $1.00 more), Belgian chips (french fries) cooked to perfection, and.... the best part of the menu- free salad bar with your falafel pita sandwich. you can put anything and everything on that pita of yours (your choice of wheat or white pita). the regular meal includes grilled eggplant & hummus, but i was more interested in filling up my sandwich with grilled cauliflower, cole slaw (which is amazing!!!!), tossed carrot salad, tahina, yogurt sauce, cucumbers, and hot sauce! the sandwich comes in a nifty paper holder- good for your sandwich to stand up as your piling on the delicious condiments and veggies in there. the server handed me the Belgian Chips (fries)... basically like Pomme Frites (with sauce). I asked for a bag and they gave me a heat-saving pocket. i love that. I walked to work (which is on the same block and literally 30 seconds away) and stole a fry from the bag as i'm entering the elevator. i ran over to the break-room ripped open the bag. let me tell you- the sandwich was so good- i couldn't put the pita down! not even to snag a few Chips in my mouth... or open the bottle of water. the falafel was delightful. not too hard and crunchy, but not soggy and crumbly. i ate with pure satisfaction. the sandwiches, salad boxes, soup, and the Maoz falafel ball are all sold separately if you don't want a whole meal deal. oh yeah, you forgot that it's a vegetarian place, huh? haha. well, the food is so fulfilling and delicious- for you non-vegetarians: it's still a fabulous meal. try it. you'll probably see me in the window chowing down.",20,0.9983

We're the definitive foodies, We've been to Bouley, Boulud etc., why am I feeling like a complete fool right now? Why can't I think straight? I couldn't even listen properly to what he was saying""To which, a friend responds, ""You know, for the life of me I can't figure out! I need a pen to mark through the options on the menu, and then select through a process of elimination. Looking at these options and food descriptions, and with his words still ringing in my ears, I just can't think straight.""I respond, ""Ok, so we must let the left brain take over now. Let's start reading aloud what these options are and what they could be like. As we start hearing our own voices, things may become clearer"".That's the magic of Jean Georges! People talk about food that appeals to all five senses, Jean Georges actually delivers that experience. From the intense aromas (I still remember the truffle...ooh I've never remembered a non-dessert food item like I remember their truffle!), to the passionate description of the dish, from the nuances of the arctic char to the textures of the egg caviar, the explosive scent intensity of the various broth items to the smoky froth that lightens the foie gras... There's no blending in, but flourishes, big and small, that all vie to grab your attention.In case you chose not to go with tradition (the centuries old menu) I strongly recommend to go with the server's recommendations. Also, the sommelier is extremely knowledgeable and made an excellent suggestion on a Chateauneuf-du-Pape Reserve 2003 from Rhone.As we got to my favorite part of the meal, I looked at the available options which amounted to dessert-within-a-dessert: one could go with a theme (Chocolate, Citrus, Late Harvest, and Winter) and in that theme one would get 4 different desserts. Obviously, chocolate intrigued me (Molten Chocolate cake with Vanilla bean; Granite, coffee-cardamom meringue; milk chocolate Peanut cake with salted caramel ice cream; white chocolate with mint yuzu and pink peppered sable). BUT, hold on, there's a problem: I don't eat white chocolate... period. So, I request if I may replace that with another chocolate option in the citrus category. Surprisingly, the server says that it cannot be done. However, I am in no mood to take no for an answer. I beckon him and inquire, ""Have you heard the Cinderella story?"" He responds (somewhat bemused), ""Yes, sir"". Me: ""So, you obviously know about Cinderella, her plain looking step sisters and the ugly, wicked witch"". He: ""Excuse me, sir... but there's no wicked witch in Cinderella, just a fairy godmother. You are mixing up Cinderella with Snow White"". Me: ""Precisely: if dark chocolate is Cinderella, and milk chocolate is the plain step sister, then white chocolate is the witch that has nothing to do with the story. So, you see, my point is: White chocolate isn't chocolate!"" He (by now smiling broadly): ""that's persuasive enough for me, sir. I'll see what I can do. Though for a moment, I was wondering about the potency of those Rhone Valley grapes"".At least, that's how I remember the story..for he did end up substituting the white chocolate dessert. But, I must confess all of the desserts were extremely complex versions and full marks to the pastry chef.At this, a friend marveled at my passion for dessert, despite the extravagant meal. So, I shared my philosophy on desserts in easily understood terms (and seek your indulgence for the same): the process of pleasure is similar to that in sex. You have to get in the mood by talking about it, anticipation creates the excitement, it is important in its own right (as opposed to compensating for a bad day at work), one must build up appropriately (as opposed to immediate gratification as a ""sugar fix""), you need to relax and savor the complete experience. And, the ONLY thing which should make you feel guilty is - if you give of yourself fully on the first date. Unless, of course, it's true love!  ;-))",43,0.9915

Little did I expect to find a beautiful place like this one. The decor is modern and sophisticated, with white leather couches and dim neon lighting, alleys of pebble stones on the floor, and a men's room vaguely reminiscent of a teleporter booth. I was there with yelptastic Joolie T, Maritess Z, Audrey J, Maria M and Javier M, and we got one of the karaoke room combos: for $250, private room until closing, bottle of Grey Goose with unlimited mixers, beer and fruit platter... A little pricey but not too bad a deal considering the crazy fun we had in there. The room was pretty nice, but they need to revert those one-way mirrors: people outside can see you, but you can't see them... so strange. Soon enough the disco lights were on and we were all rocking to Korean pop, Grease and Madonna. I wish I could remember more of what we sang... I guess the Grey Goose did its job. What I do remember, though, is putting on a dance show with Maritess that would have made Britney blush. I had no voice when we finally left at 4am.",18,0.9487

Most NYC film houses fail miserably in the charm department, creating stuffy, impersonal atmospheres that cater to a raucous clientele who would rather spend two hours hurling a litany of obscenities at a screen than actually watching a film. If movie chain giants like AMC and Sony are alarmed by the home theater revolution spearheaded by Netflix and other DVD rental services, they should be. Most people are quite tired of shelling out top dollar for a movie ticket, only to endure the misogynistic humor stylings of some 15 year old who just snuck into the theater. Eventually, I grew weary of waiting for films to come out on dvd JUST so I could avoid being trapped in a darkroom with a throng of unruly, squirming puberty pirates. Time to take back the theaters, my friends!!! But where to go? RBP11 shone like a beacon in the vast, dark terrain of movie going mayhem.Despite being located in close proximity to Ground Zero, RBP11 has managed to survive in area that saw so many businesses financially decimated in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy. When I started noticing a large number of tourists congregating at the WTC site to make a morbid, post-mortem examination of a neighborhood in mourning, I decided to take a break from visiting the area. I found RBP11 when I couldn't obtain ducats to some overproduced blockbuster that was selling out everywhere else. I didn't wait on line for very long, and with some time to kill, I decided to check out some of RBP11's non-cinematic offerings such as the restaurants and hotel(!!!) situated in the complex. I can't remember off hand the exact names of the restaurants, but I was taken aback by their presence in a cineplex, nonetheless. And the hotel? Wow. You could go to bed right after the movie if you made reservations :) The theater itself (at least the one I was in) was quite impressive. Cushy seats with a reclining feature, and enough legroom so your knees won't be crushed if the person in front of you leans back. Best of all, my fellow moviegoers conducted themselves in a civilized manner. Not one cell phone went off. Can't ask for more than that!

They have one of the hottest broilers in the city, so the steak is marvelously seared on the outside. Their seasoning is simple and stellar. You don't need steak sauce.

2200,16,5,5.0,"An Ode to West Harlem Pizza...Just wanted to expand on Lindsay's review. The reason there's no listing for this place is because it's not listed under Paul's Pizza but under the name of the Greek owner. I just made the update to Yelp.History lesson! This pizzeria has been around for 32 years. It's original location used to be the northeast corner of 138th St and Broadway where McDonald's now stands. This place used to be the epicenter of Pizza in West Harlem back in the day. The setup they had is not much different than what you'll find now. It was a long counter from one end of the place to the other and tables with small, revolving stools. What was so cool is that ALL the CCNY students would end up eating here as it was on the way to the train station. It was an awesome corner to people watch. My 'buelita used to take me here to eat almost everyday (God, today has become all about my grandma). It's been owned by the same Greek family for all those years. By extension they became honorary Dominicans (their spanish is ridiculously on point). This was the type of place where you'd have those diner ""characters"". There was the harmless, but crazy old greek guy that would sit in the corner drinking coffee all day and talkng to himself. Yet he would mop the store down at the end of the day. You had the old-school Dominican drug capos that wore nothing but Pierre Cardin shoes, Oscar de la Renta slacks, and guayabera shirts with the obligatory Old Spice smell emanating from them. You also had new dominican arrivals being introduced to their first slice of new york pizza. About 12 years ago there was a massive fire that destroyed most of the building. The place closed down and in about a year opened up at the current location. Same folks.This is by far the best pizza I have ever tasted in New York. It's no-frills here. I mean they even have the same stools from the 80's. Very barebones. But the family that owns it are the best. Case in point. The other day my brother & I got the craving and walked over. We wanted a fresh tomatoe pizza. Just so happens that's not on the menu. But the lady said, ""Get some tomatoes from the store and I'll them on for you."" I went to the bodega next door and bought two big tomatoes. She sliced em' and diced em' and put em on the pizza. I have never tasted such a juicy and satisfying pizza, and I've been buying from them since I was 5.Only thing that sucks...no delivery. I have always moaned about it to them. They don't seem to be budging anytime soon.lol. The good pizza compensates for it. (I still gave them 5 stars!)",22,0.9834

This experience was phenomenal from making reservations to the last good-bye as we walked out the door.The name comes from Christina Rossetti's nineteenth-century poem ""Goblin Market,"" where hideous little men hawk their wares to the ruin of young women. This could, indeed, ruin the New York restaurant experience for you as it's just head and shoulders above most moderately priced locales. So nice, so caring is the service that they make you feel like old friends coming over for dinner. And the space: Charming and quaint with a true old school vibe.While at Goblin Market, try a bottle of the Tempernillo (one of the many fantastic suggestions from our server). For apps, go for the Shrimp Risotto or Chicken Pot Pie. For dinner, I would suggest opting for the Bass or the Miso-Glazed Steak. Actually, the Pork Tenderloin is dreamy as well.

Medium sized, dimly-lit atrium bar leads to large dining room in the back. There is u-shaped booth style seating along one wall, great for groups of 5 ish. This is definitely not a casual dining place but not a cocktail dress night either. Be safe and wear dress pants. or i keeel you. jk. First eye-opener is the bread basket. I realized later it's the same bread that's served at Lucy's Latin Kitchen in Union Sq. Except Lucy's has some unwritten policy of one bread per guest, whereas here you get a basket bonanza! Great unusual dipping sauce. I don't know what the heck is in it but it's a light happy-feeling sauce. I recommend: Appetizers: Chicharron : a crispy calamari, and the Empanadas (has great lobster filling!)Ceviches: Mariscos: ohh yeah. lobster and shrimp Conchitas: scallops all with great complimentary sides. all has the slightly sour taste, but that's how they all normally taste. mm..Entrees: ( all $19 to mid-$20 ish) i LOVE the Vaca Frita Al Caballo. This is where steak is done right. holy cow. literally. I had the Cordero once which is braised lamb shank. Ehh was not that impressed. It has that applebee's fajitas style serving, u make your own little burritos or whatever, but it was just a lot of work (i don't like to work when i eat, cutting steak is as far as it goes) but i think it came with a mole-type sauce. (smokey black bean(?) type sauce) and i'm not a fan of moles. on people or on my lamb. jk.=)My friend had the Chuleta, pork chop, which was pretty damn good. i tried it when she wasn't looking.

Yes, in many ways and on most pages. I mean the magazine, not Yelp. From the ads for Searle and Vuitton to the Strategist section to the Real Estate section at the back. But hey, New York caters to the wealthy, I always say, so a magazine bearing the city's name must accurately reflect the city, don't you think? I think. Time Out NY? That doesn't reflect New York. That reflects Williamsburg. But there is no other magazine, that I know of anyway, that examines New York politics and stories like NY Mag does, and that's why I love it so. it is really a cover-to-cover read. The Arts section is another reason to love it. I like the listing of sales that comes right after the Strategist, and the restaurant section is really thorough. Whenever I have used the section to pick a place for brunch or dinner, the recommendation is spot on and everyone goes away happy. Last but not least, I love the crosswords by Maura Jacobsen. They are my favorites because they are somewhat easy, yet I always feel mighty special when I actually finish one, and some of my friends think I'm hot shit for doing them at all! I do so like to daydream about lottery winnings and how much house they would buy, so I peruse the real estate section often. It also makes me happy that New York magazine only dedicates one page to social events and not the last 50 or so, like Ocean Drive. Ugh. Although NY mag has The Matrix, but i find that really interesting and funny, and I hear myself say things like, ""I know, right?""I look forward to getting my New York magazine every week, and wherever I may roam, I will maintain my subscription. I hope those TONY guys will read this and, for the love of Pete, stop sending me ""This is your last chance"" crap in the mail.Happy 100!!!!PS - At the risk of losing my ""Useful, Funny, Cool"" thingies, I wanted to thank all my peeps who congratulated me on my 100th review.

2209,18,12,5.0,"Growing up as I did in a setting where the best toys were the ones that magically came from ""abroad"" through my father's tours, I learnt to respect and value toys as a toddler--in much the same way as adults respect their art collection or their blackberries--especially when they pay attention to their berries to the detriment of good conversation with their friends. Like many of us, I have friends who do just that. But I digress. Toys have never ceased to fascinate me. I had a choo-choo train that would produce smoke in a puffing pattern. And then there was the Apollo 11 and a Volkswagen beetle. I graduated to a full-fledged train set, thanks again to my father. And there was the Rubik's cube. I had a friend, who was a whiz kid who cracked the code of the cube and solved it in less than a minute, consistently. I digress again.Well, back to the review. I used to think Franz Carl Weber in Zurich was it when I lived there. And then Hamley's in London seemed even better. But FAO beats them both. Yes, Hamley's is bigger, but big is not always better in toy stores.I would think FAO makes the largest share of its profits on the rich kids around Central Park South who can afford customized six-foot tall horses and life-size Barbies. But their flagship store location here in New York is a glorious treat for a wide range of ages. 0-99, although you occasionally see folks beyond that age range wandering around the store.The great things about FAO are 1) the toys are top notch 2) they encourage you to play with the toys on display and 3) they have uniformly good service. FAO doesn't like being labeled a toy store but a ""Top 10 attraction in New York city"", which it clearly is. Oh, a fourth plus point--as you browse their selection, you can munch on goodies from FAO Schweetz that is housed within the store.I think FAO is to New York what 'nip and tuck' is to celebs.

Now, coming from California, I thought all pizza was supposed to have a yeasty bready crust and have copious amounts of sauce and gooey cheese.

I loved them. And I loved the general vibe of SSSB. Relaxed atmosphere with comfortable chairs and tables, good coffee and lots and lots of delicious cupcake morsels. I think that one of the things that I like most about SSSB is the variety of cupcakes. I'm tired of just vanilla and chocolate and different colours of icing. I want a little excitement and that's what I found here. I tried the chocolate, red velvet, pistachio and pumpkin cupcakes (yes, I'm fat today) and what I've discovered is that the ones that retain the moist goodness, a feature that we all search for in cupcake production, are the ones with nuts or moist fruit/vegetable in them. The pistachio was my absolute favorite, with the pumpkin being a close second (LOVE the cream cheese icing). I think I'm kind of over red velvet at this point, although I still love the idea - they're just so often dry, but here they were pretty good, just not AS good as the others. Are these my favourite cupcakes in the city so far? Yes.",8,0.9891

Being a sushi aficionado, I am very particular about my fish and Yasuda is one of those establishment where you cannot even begin to fathom what you are missing until you experience it. Do believe all the hype and the accolades. It is ridiculous how fresh the fish tastes and the service is top-shelf.Need convincing otherwise? Just sit at the bar and order the omakase. It's so good that you will accidentally scream out Yasuda San's name while you're having sex with your girlfriend. And that's okay, because your girlfriend will do the same because she ordered the spanish mackerel and kanpachi sashimi. The spanish mackerel at Yasuda simply melts in your mouth and is nothing short of orgasmic. Yes, go ahead and order a plateful, no one is judging.For those that are budget conscious, there is also a $20.50 sashimi or sushi pre fixe dinner. If you do decide to go with the budget dinner, good luck trying to stop your inner sushi slut from ordering more... I know I can't.

Before I went to Rudy's, it had been far too long since I had a hot dog at 3am. The hot dog was not really hot, and it did not taste good. But to me, it was the idea of the hot dog that mattered--having processed meat products nearby when you are drinking is oddly comforting.The best thing about Rudy's is the crowd it draws.

2221,11,18,5.0,"Pearl Oyster Bar - where have you been all my life? I couldn't have walked into this place with higher expectations after seeing this restaurant at the top of the Yelp rankings but it still managed to exceed them.I got there at 7:40PM on a Wednesday night and was greeted by a very pleasant hostess who informed me it would be an hour wait. On a Wednesday night? Man, this place must be GREAT...Two beers and a glass of cheap ($6) but yummy Spanish wine later, my companion and i are seated. Time check - 9:10PM...an hour and a half of buildup. (Note: we were offered seats at the bar before then but figured we waited that long...)Started by splitting 6 raw oysters (~$9) and a bowl of clam chowder (~$7).... The oysters were amazingly fresh. No tricks. Just 6 oysters on ice, lemon wedge, cocktail sauce, and i think vinegar. I could've downed two plates of these oysters. I don't buy into the aphrodisiac thing with oysters but these oysters were hitting some pleasure center in my brain that doesn't usually get reached by food. But afrodisiac - hell, with these oysters, I could go from A (shucking) to C (smoking) without engaging in any action (B) that rhymes with A.  I'd consider these more of a postphrodisiac b/c I'd have sex with someone just to get these oysters.Ok, if I haven't spoiled your appetite yet - onto the most erotic of the cream-based mollusk soups - the New England clam chowder. Mmm. Thick but not heavy. Clammy but not fishy. Faint smoky bacon taste.  Right amount of potatoes. Could've used perhaps a few more clam bits in there but, as is, it was still as good if not better than any chowder I've had in New England or SF. (thank god it wasn't 'Manhattan' clam chowder, the red brothy imposter that has fooled oh so many chowder-seekers....Guiliani could clean up Times Square but he couldn't correct this injustice and ban that soup and/or remove our fine borough's name from it?)Now to the main course. Lobster roll ($22). A buttery hot dog-like roll overflowing with chunks of lobster connected together by as little mayo as seemingly possible. (I hate mayo so that was great). This was joined with shoestring fries that are so skinny they resemble those potato stick snacks.One bite of the lobster and I'm in crustacean heaven (well, homosapien heaven - I don't believe in an afterlife but if any species deserves a nice one, it's lobsters). I'm not opposed to cracking open a lobster but it sure is nice when you can just appreciate how tasty lobster is without breaking out the shellcracker, a bib, or dairy nectar (drawn butter). So glad I wasn't starving b/c I tantra-cize this experience out some 15-20 minutes (and it's in a hot dog roll - what's the average start/finish time for a hot dog - 2 minutes?). The delicious fries - which I douse with malt vinegar - help extend the moment. I probably talked during this time but it must've been thanks to some autopilot conversation process my mind set up like a backup generator for moments when society requires something more than my preoccupied brain can provide (often exercised during football games if someone dares talk about anything except football).I finish and am shocked to discover that I'm not in a 'wafer-thin mint' state where I fear explosion. I could eat dessert too! The offerings look great - a hot fudge sundae and apple crumble pie seem like fastballs down the middle. A butterscotch prailine parfait (~$7) seems like something I'd never order but the waitress recommends it so giddy-up.  And it's great - i don't like butterscotch and I loved it. Perfect ending to a perfect dinner.By the time I got home, I had to fight the temptation to Yelp it. But the experience wasn't over.

2225,8,3,5.0,"Fried ChickenThis place isn't your normal KFC, Kentucky Fried Chicken, it's more like Korean style Fried Chicken... yes I know, bad joke!So probably amongst the many who will be frequenting here from the outer boroughs and who don't live in the area, will be coming here to try to place out because they read about it in a New York Times article, there will be plenty more reviews after mine, I'm sure. (run on sentence, very so)How is this place? I think it is a very good alternative to the traditional fried chicken out there. I don't feel like my arteries are going to clog up, but that feeling every once in a while is good! It is not heavily breaded, even though their breading is a bit 'fluffy', but crispy. There are several flavors to order from, original, spicy mustard, sweet and spicy, soy-garlic and hot. I had ordered the hot and original, just to see how it tasted without the sauce. The original, obvious tasted plain, but the breading gaving it a little flavor, so it wasn't so bad. The hot is really good, at first you don't really taste it that hot, but afterwards, oh boy.. nice and spicy! The chicken isn't fried too much and since all the parts are dark meat, it isn't dry. ***I've tried all the flavors here already, except for the mustard flavor, because I don't really like mustard. My favorites are the UFC Spicy and the UFC Soy Garlic. The sweet and spicy is more sweet, with a little hint of spicy, but you can't really tell all too much. At times they might run out of certain flavors, as they told me once when I tried to order a flavor that ran out, that most of the ingredients are imported, so if the shipment arrives late, they won't have a certain flavor. So be prepared to choose an alternative.With your order, you can choose from different chicken parts. For a small order you can have all wings (10), a mix of wings and drumsticks (6 wings, 3 drumsticks), just drumsticks (6) or a whole chicken. I prefer a mix of the wings and drumsticks, it makes for a better deal. A whole chicken is a little more than a large order for 16.99. The price, in my opinion is a little high, but for what you get ('healthier' fried chicken, and unique taste), i think it's worth it. For a small order it is $9 and a large order is $16. With each order you get a salad, choice, which you can choose from the marinated radish, coleslaw, macaroni salad or a side salad.The also offer a chicken ranch or parm panini, along with fries (regular and sweet potato) and 3 other salads (premium, chef and crispy chicken) but i didn't order any of those. ***My gf had ordered the crispy chicken salad recently. The salad isn't anything all too special, but she did like the tenderness and taste of the small piece of breaded chicken that was with the salad. The restaurant, isn't that big. There is a table that seats about 3 people and then a bar seating area that seats about 8. When I got there yesterday, there were about 15 people around waiting for their food. But when I went to pick up my food about 40mins later, there were just 3 people around.Right now since everyone is probably going to come here because they read the article about the 'new' korean style fried chicken, it's suggested you call ahead of time to make your order, or you'll have to wait about 40mins for your food. If you don't live in the area, it might just not be worth the trip for the wait. ***Since things have calmed down lately, it only takes about 10-20mins to get your food, so no need to really call ahead if you are in the area, but safer to do so.Upon completing this review, this is the first time I've tried korean style fried chicken and since this might be a new 'fad' out there, I have nothing to compare it to, even though there is Bon Chon in Manhattan. This was the more convenient location for me, since I live in the area. I personally give this place 5 stars, because I have nothing else to compare it to. However, If you really want to try the best version of this chicken, my cousin suggests going to Boom Boom Chicken in Fort Lee, NJ.",15,0.9979

Its downplayed, its not mentioned, its avoided, its mentioned in passing..but what makes everything work here is the Mustard. That stuff packs some amazing punch. Get the $3 cracker and cheese platter. They bring an unopened wrap of Saltines, some good sliced cheddar and some sliced onions. It is amazing how such a simple dish is the perfect accompaniment to the beer. Combine the cracker, cheese and onions, slather on some mustard, and knock off a glass of beer to wash down the heat. Repeat. Share your platter with the friendly crowd at the table you were squeezed into. Make friends, talk about the mustard, the history of the place. Hear how many of the people there were brought there originally by their dad or their grandpa. Make another sandwich..feel your sinus clear. See the sinus' of the people around you clear. Order another round of beers (I prefer the dark to the light) to wash down the mustard. Stack another cracker..or try the ham and cheese sandwich (yes..with mustard). Wash it down with the beer. Enjoy the crowd. Don't try bantering with the waiters cause they are not in the mood. Another cracker and cheese, some more mustard, another beer (feeling no pain now...just a drop of tearing from the mustard)!

There's no debate in my mind, Sugar Sweet Sunshine rulz the Cupcake world!How can Peg and Deb (the owners) resist the heavenly creations from their own shop? It makes no sense to see the ""Olsen twin-thin"" girls when they have the most amazing cupcakes and desserts around them. So, what differentiates S3B's cupcakes from the others? The frosting is just right and smooth --- neither too sweet, nor too stiff. Not overpowering, yet each flavor distinctive. The cake's truly exceptional. Soft, moist and best of all (unlike Billy's) doesn't break up into crumbs at every bite (annoying to manage when there is no seating available).Freshness isn't an issue as they bake day long. They also have a wider selection of flavors --- the ones I found truly exceptional were: Pumpkin, Pistachio, Sassy (chocolate almond icing with red velvet), and Coconut. Sassy and Sexy are both delicious (Sassy over Sexy). Also, as I am extremely partial to cream cheese frosting (Pumpkin) I am not amused when Billy's has none available in their cupcakes. No such issue at S3B.The cupcakes are so amazing that in a period of one and a half hours this past Saturday I polished off 4 cupcakes --- and still managed to enjoy the delicious Pineapple Upside down cake (soft, moist, flavorful, and light)! Compare this to the Supersized Crumbs where I struggled to finish off even one regular Cappuccino cupcake.Their chairs are comfortable and the ambience, warm and inviting - exactly what Magnolia set out to be 10 years ago, but lost its way in the process. The one likely issue is limited seating, especially since the regular patrons stay and chat for hours on end.Like that at Billy's, S3B's service also doesn't enthuse. I ordered a cappuccino while my friend asked for tea. The server responded ""Which tea? We have so many. Do you have 'any' idea of what you want?"" I could have been wrong, but it seemed that he had emphasized ""any"". That called for a lesson in humility, and so I responded: Darjeeling. Sheepishly, he said no. Oolong? No. My friend catching on asked: Orange Pekoe. Yet again, no. ""So what kind of tea DO you have""? Server (by now looking down): ""Earl grey, Chamomile...""They don't have a wash room like Buttercup's, and their location isn't that of Magnolia's or Billy's, but I can't rate them at the same level.

Still, as ""old"" downtown Brooklyn continues to die a slow death and transforms itself into the Ratner City Space Station, Juniors will remain. Don't even BOTHER trying to procure a cheesecake on the eve of a big family holiday. Not going to happen. The lines are three deep...now that's girth (lil inside joke for those who remember me misusing 'girth' in the Mark W. post)! Best part about Junior's is that the cheesecake isn't the sole reason to eat here. They have a pretty impressive diner menu that includes an enormous hamburger that would easily fill the most bottomless pit of a belly. The portion of fries served with a deluxe is generous, and even gratuitous given the size of the burgers. More than anything, I find the wait staff incredibly kind and accommodating given the daily pressures they must encounter with the sheer number of customers. Our waiter returned no less than 5 times...and not in an annoying manner, to make sure we had everything we needed. Also, if you have room, don't pass up any of their old school diner classics like a milk shake or a cherry lime rickey...Junior's blends them all to perfection. Just do yourself a favor, and make it to Junior's before you die. Travel with that ""Death or cheesecake"" spirit, and your meal will be that much more satisfying. Personally, I prefer cheesecake to death.P.s. What was that guy talking about a few reviews down...you know, the guy who was disappointed that there was no sour cream on his cheesecake (WTF!!???!!).

The uni was like cool, creamy butter and probably the best thing that's ever touched my mouth. Including a couple of bottles of sake and beer, it set us back about $100 each with the tip.

I guess I did more of the drinking and she did more of the munching, but whatever:) There was one waiter for the whole restaurant, which at 11pm, I suppose isn't too crazy. Whenever you could flag him down, he was a sweet and helpful guy. Again, the poor guy had up to 10 tables to handle--blaming him for not being the bionic waiter would be silly (I hope the rude people sitting next to us that kept bitching to the manager for free food are reading this!).The food was fantastic. We started with the Samba 7 roll, which better deliver at $16/roll. Well, it did! There's a good amount of lobster in the roll, as well as a powerful kick of wasabe. And the textures (very important in sushi) work together so well.  Then, we ordered the Kobe beef flat bread which is drizzled in the most amazing green sauce and the yellowtail sashimi seviche was to.die.for. I've never had such beautifully soft, buttery yellowtail (okay, so I've never paid $11 for it either;)). The drinks were poured well and were strong. I had so many mojitos my breath was fabulous when I left!

What really puts me over the edge is their Peking Duck. Good god they know how to make Peking duck. It absolutely Is expensive ($55 for the plate, makes about 8 pancakes and then a second course).  But oh so worth it when you can afford a good treat for yourself (or have someone else paying!). You really can't go wrong w/ the main courses. I also recommend the Beef Tse Yang Style and their lobster in black bean sauce. Quite delicious. (The apps I'll admit I haven't been blown away with, but they are still status quo for a nice Chinese restaurant.) Re: the candy-coated fried donuts on the table, I can't really understand how one would be offended by that. The apple donuts come fresh out of boiling water and are dunked into the cold water to crystallize the sugar-coating. As a result, when they are served to you they have this nice hard outside, but a deliciously warm inside. It is a full experience. This is not some grand display that you are forced to watch (I didn't even notice it the first time I had them), it is just how they prepare it for you, in the same way that they will show you a large plate of the duck skin before folding it into the pancakes/hoison sauce/scallion. Service is very impressive / maybe a little over the top. Our waiter didn't take notes, and every time we would order something, he would give us a fullllll description of the dish. Yah. We know what the dish is. We're ordering it. But heck, it's nice to be treated pretentiously every once in a while. ;)Anyways, we're all entitled to our opinions. Is Tse Yang pretentious?

My mother's chicken marsala was so good, I discovered a new love for marsala sauce. Even penne pommodoro, a quite simple sauce of riccota and tomato, was incredibly tasty. The bread is served along side a bowl of olives soaking in oil, and the water is left on the table in an old wine bottle. While Buon Gusto has tables outside, inside is just adorable. Located on 77th between Second and Third, it feels off the beaten tracks of the tired Italian spots lining Second ave. The inside is small, but comfortable, with warm light and dark furniture.

If you buy them frozen, they keep in the freezer and you can either steam them or even microwave them for 30 seconds and they're hot and delicous. These are really like the most delicous and mysterous food ever and the mysteriousness is the best part. You really shouldn't concern yourself at all with what's inside, even though they say it's pork, because my guess is the more you know the less you will like it. They sell other stuff here, too. Stuff that's not frozen, but fresh and piping hot. But if you don't speak or read Chinese, you have to be really adventurous, because it's generally hard to know what is what. There is some English going on, but the store is so tiny that if you don't know what you want right away, you're going to be in someone's way. I like the sticky rice with pork or Chinese sausage and peanuts wrapped in banana leaves, hot and ready to eat. My friend Audrey used to bring these to work and eat them for lunch sometimes and I would stare with my mouth watering and she would toss me a peanut if she was feeling generous or call security on me if she was feeling normal. Sometimes her grandmother had made the sticky rice and sometimes it was her aunt, so those ones were probably a little bit better than the ones from May May. But the ones from May May are really good, too. And if you don't have a Chinese aunt or grandmother of your own, at some point, you just have to accept that they're probably the best you're going to get. At $1.80 a pop, the deliciousness-consumed to money-spent ratio is in the sweet spot. In fact, I challenge you to eat two of these dudes.If you beg for information, the ladies who work at May May will even tell you how to pronounce some of the Chinese names. Sure they look at you funny, shaking their head, when you screw up and they shake their broom at you after your twentieth or thirtieth question and they shout things at you that you don't understand but that probably mean something like, ""Get out of our store you clumsy white oaf in running clothes before you knock all our piles of stuff over.""

Little Branch is the type of ""secret"" neighborhood bar that will really impress a date or some special out-of-town guests. Once you locate the unassuming door, on the corner of 7th Ave. and Leroy St., you find yourself ushered down a small flight of steps into the bowels of the city. A small, low lit and inviting room awaits you at the bottom of the steps. There are a number of comfortable booths lining the far wall, each adorned with a single candle and hooks to hang your hat and coat. If you can't get a table, no worries, as there is plenty of room near the bar. Putting the charming speakeasy aesthetics aside, the main reason to go to Little Branch is for the cocktails. Drink specials are listed on a small menu, and though wine and beer (and even champagne) are offered, you will want to opt for one of the mixed drinks. Each bartender at Little Branch is trained by a master mixologist, and even if you aren't sure about what to order, just trust the bartenders to create something special for you. You will not be disappointed. The drinks are so well-crafted (yes, well-crafted) that you are able to taste each ingredient while still being able to enjoy the overall combination of a truly unique cocktail. Like Fight Club, Little Branch has a few rules, but I won't disclose them to you. You should have the experience of discovering them for yourself during your first visit to the bar.

More specifically go there to contemplate and remember that the WTC as a perfect microcosm of New York City in marvelous, compact miniature. The gleaming towers represent to me the place New York holds as the business Goliath it is. It had tip-of-the-arrow dining (Windows on the World) down to subsistence eating, namely the recurring open markets held on Broadway street-side. It was also a transportation hub offering travel through sea and air, a communications and information center linking all parts of the world, and it was it's own ecosystem, all of which New York City is to a greater degree.The WTC was also a crucible containing the entire spectrum of New Yorkers, from multi-millionaire CEOs to the undocumented workers whose surviving families cannot collect benefits because they had no identification and were not citizens of our country.Perhaps the ultimate icon within the icon may have been the large spherical plaza sculpture by Arnoldo Pomodoro showing a once-perfect sphere perverted from within; it's ghastly inner workings bursting out like a bio-mechanical cancer.

I can even recall asking a friend from the region, ""is that like a spring roll but with lobster inside?"" I couldn't have been farther from the truth--and fortunately, the Pearl Oyster Bar's cuisine couldn't be farther from the cheap Chinese food that prompted my first inquiry into the ""lobster roll."" On my first visit, I was interested primarily in oysters--as I've said in previous reviews, I live to eat them raw, and am thoroughly impressed when a restaurant satisifies my sick need for a living creature to die moments before I slurp (and lustily chew) it down. Sitting at the bar itself, I ordered half a dozen oysters, clam chowder, and this mysterious item called the ""lobster roll."" The oysters were thoroughly excellent--not the best I've ever had (Oyster Bar in Grand Central owns that distinction), but seriously delectable. The clam chowder--well, it was light years beyond the stuff I'd grown up with at many and various Red Lobsters in Chicago. I was starting to feel full after eating it, and was worried about the main course. Feeling nervous when the lobster roll arrived, I did what I call ""the puzzled dog face"" (tilting to the side and lifting the crown of the head high)--it was an open-faced sandwich, with a ton of lobster meat in what looked like mayonnaise, sided by a crap-load of shoestring fries.  I dug in, and my life--the world, indeed--has not been the same since. I was full from the moment I bit into the roll, but I couldn't stop. It was just too damned good. Appeals from passersby were in vain--the bartender looked on in horror as I consumed approximately (cue Dr. Evil voice) one BILLION calories--and all with finger-licking gusto and a gourmand's contempt for the casual, part-time feeder. The Pearl Oyster Bar changed my life.

2283,10,29,5.0,"I am a New Yorker. I was born in Spanish Harlem in 1977 at the Flower on 5th Hospital. I grew up on the Upper West Side and spent my formative years in public high-schools throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn. I went off to college at SUNY Purchase in Westchester and graduated with BFA in 2001. I did all this on a learner's permit (well not the being born part). But once you get out of college, a learner's permit just doesn't cut it. You go out to a bar and you hand over something that says learner's permit and immediately you toughness quotient plummets. So at 28, I decided to get that license and finally grow up. I signed up for an 8 pack at The Professional Driving School. The actual school looks really seedy. It looks like they just moved in. There is stuff stuck into corners, and the bathroom looks like a the washroom in a Russian submarine. Luckily, you wont be spending much time there. The classes start off with your 5 hour class on driving safety, which this school smartly schedules after working hours. It was painless and you get to watch videos with Scott Baio explaining the importance of not drinking and driving. The classes in the car were fantastic. Learning to drive in New York City is probably one of the best decisions I have ever made, because once you feel comfortable driving in Manhattan, noting will scare you... well except highway traffic in Los Angeles, but that's another story. You learn all the basics and my teacher was professional and very informative. He picked me up during my lunch hour and we went through K-turns, city driving, and lots of parallel parking. When it was time for my test, I met up with my instructor and drove over to Staten Island to take my test. Although I missed a stop sign (oops!), my quick driving reflexes impressed the tester so much that she passed me without any comments. Now when I walk into a bar the bouncers all nod to my immeasurable drivatude, women flock to my arms, and drinks are always on the house.

I was greeted by the most beautiful girl i've ever seen. she was intimidating- as much as the decor and ambience of the place was too. i felt a little underdressed and scrubby- but she made me feel warm and welcome right away. the interior design is absolutely chic and beautiful. little intricate details all over the place. with a mini waterfall by the checkout, romantic candle lights, white table cloths, and bold colors/lines/patterns all over the walls, doors, etc. the interior decorator knew was he/she was doing. the Tom Yum (lemongrass soup w/ shrimp or chicken, delicious veggies, mildly spicy) immediately warmed me up. oh, how i craved for it!!! as i'm studying the menu, i notice the music playing in the background.... very nice. from light r&b, jazz, dance, neo soul, acid jazz, and a lil bit of break beats... the music was tasteful. the Curry Puffs (Chicken & Potato in yellow curry sauce in a Puff Pastry) were delectable. it felt so perfect in my mouth.

2299,9,1,5.0,"Just so everyone in San Francisco doesn't think I'm a stingy pizza reviewing bee-atch, I'll pen an ode to the best pizza man ever, my hero, the one and only Domenico DeMarco the proprietor of DiFara's on Avenue J, smack dap in the center of Brooklyn.Dom is amazing and at almost 80 years old he hand makes every single pie at DiFara's today, just the way he has for almost 50 years. He uses tomatoes he imports himself from his home region in Italy. He sprinkles each pie with a combo of three high quality cheese - regular semi hard mozzarella, fresh mozzarella and parmesan. He make two kinds of pies - square and regular. He offers only a few toppings and they are prepared to order. When you order a sausage slice, he or a helper goes to the back and slices sausage for your pizza. The special toppings are artichoke and porcini mushroom - Dom claims to import these things himself. They are expensive but when you order an artichoke slice you have more artichokes than pizza on your plate and it's worth every penny. My presonal favorites are sausage (nice and fennel-ly) and the peppers/onions/mushroom combo. I also always get at least one square and one regular and have been known to eat 4 slices in one visit.Going to DiFara's is like making a pilgrimage. Since it's only Dom making pies it's a slow process, he makes every pie to order and he's so busy that the pies for slices don't last long. So every slice is almost fresh out of the oven. The slowness really gets to some people but I love it. It means that I get to watch Dom work and that is a beautiful thing. He is a master at his craft, he creates every pie with love and tenderness, he moves with grace and harmony. Watching him make pizza is like watching art in motion. Dom knows all his regulars. He even remembered me after a nine month absensce. When I told him I went to Africa, he asked me if I ate pizza in Africa. When I said yes, he said we'll probably not like this and he was right. When I said i was moving to California, he said that's too bad he heard that they don't have good pizza there. And so far he's right.",7,0.9951

In short, the man knows what butter is and how to use it.When you come in, Claude will probably scowl at you. As he rings up your purchase, he will do everything in his power to make you feel like you should be buying more than you are. Frankly, he's right. You should be buying more than you are, because these pastries are some of the best in the world.The patisserie looks unremarkable from the outside, and there is no defined vibe to the clientele-- the first time I came here there was a businessman at one table and a hobo at the other, and the second time I came here there were a couple of pre-teen boys clutching skateboards. This is not a hipster place, or a foodie place. It's just. . . an amazing place, with amazing baked goods.The plain croissants are unspeakably delicious, as every review of Claude will tell you. If they sell out before you get there, try a croissant with almond filling-- in my opinion they're friendlier and more complex than the somewhat overpoweringly sweet pain au chocolat. The coffee is cheap and hot, and a pretty decent excuse to make a visit to Claude your first errand in the morning.Beware: if you have Claude's eclairs with a date, there is a strong possibility that your date will become confused and fall in love with you based solely on the fact that he or she associates you with the eclairs.

2321,13,4,5.0,"Sometimes - all too rarely - you have a dining experience that makes you remember what you're missing the rest of the time.  This is a tale of delight. It is all true. This is my story: Last night, Susan and I had selected a restaurant on Irving Place with a beautiful garden as our dining venue, but due to a (fortunate, as it turned out) series of missed phone calls, by the time we were ready to go the daylight hours were waning and I suggested a new restaurant on East 4th Street I'd just read about.  It was, you know, HOT out, and as they are wont to do for inscrutable sanitational reasons, the fine garbage men and women of New York had elected not to pick up the stinking, putrid sacks of trash that had been piled high on the sidewalks for days. But I digress. This is no way to open my first five-star review. Let's begin again: In honor of the high heat, Susan and I donned our best summer dresses and heels and tottered down to East 4th Street. No, wait - strolled. We strolled down. Because that's more elegant, isn't it? Five stars should be dignified, after all. Upon our arrival at Fork + Knife, we were greeted by Zoe, the most gracious Australian barmaid this side of Up Over, who asked if we had reservations. ""Well, no,"" we replied, all too casually. There were plenty of unoccupied tables and it was nearly eight o'clock already. We had our location of choice, the table for two in front of the doors thrown wide to the summer evening, all picked out. I prepared to tell Zoe which table we had selected. Ah, what folly. She informed us with true regret that they were fully booked that night, and that as the chef prepared only a certain amount of food each evening, there was no way they could fit us in. Our faces fell. Our stomachs growled. Our dream receded. We accepted our fate, however, and sat down at the gleaming natural wood slab bar to drown our sorrows and regroup. The menu included a wine by the glass called ""Knife and Fork,"" which, as you will recall, is the very name of the restaurant. I asked if the owner was also a wine maker, but it turns out that the name is merely a happy coincidence. We had to try it. I'm not a big chardonnay fan. Particularly if it's of the California ilk. If I want that much oak I'll just eat the tree. But this was Australian and quite lovely. As we savored it, Zoe pleaded our case again with the chef-owner (Irishman Damien Brassel), asking if he would let us eat if there were a cancellation. No. Absolutely not. Rules are rules, and, well, he'd lose credibility as a chef if he weren't capricious. We were not yet prepared to leave our beautiful and tragic surroundings, however. We marveled at the attention to detail - the impeccably shaped wine glasses imported from France, in a range of sizes to properly support various wine varietals. The wide-plank wood floor. The beaded-glass lamp shades suspended from the ceiling. The high-design silverware also imported from Europe.  We each ordered another glass and continued to chat with Zoe. And then, well, the chef must have seen the sadness that had settled in our eyes - even his iron heart (and skillet) could not withstand this unsettling loss of hope - because miraculously, two plates of herb-crusted salmon appeared before us.  Now, the bounty of the sea has never been my thing. But, oh, the salmon! Sashimi style, coated with fresh Italian parsley and dill. Laid upon a slash of creme fraiche and garnished with fresh baby lettuce. ""You couldn't buy fish this fresh,"" Susan said. ""You have to be...[whispered] ...connected."" ""Please tell the chef we are most grateful, "" I told the waiter. ""And that we found the salmon extraordinary."" He indicated that this verbal feedback would be unecessary, signaling to our plates, stripped of all evidence, scraped bare. Many unreserved parties entered throughout the evening. All were turned away.  We ordered a third glass of wine to celebrate our good fortune. But bounty has a way of multiplying, and so before long a fresh tomato consume was sent out to us in fabulous, oblong teacups. Pure distilled essence of tomato. I closed my eyes and gave silent thanks.  When our chef at last determined that we simply would not go away, he relented. Zoe told us we could be seated. At the table we had mentally chosen so long before. Victory. Was. Ours. I ordered the - ready? - ""torchon of foie gras with saffron poached pineapple and coriander, passion fruit and vanilla reduction."" And since the chef's gifts were endless, he also included a second variety of foie gras (not on the menu) on the plate. And since we had already had the tomato consomme, he insisted we consume the seared scallop for balance.  There's more, but I'm exhausted. I know you are too. So I won't take any more of your time. You'll simply have to try it yourself. (The menu changes frequently.) But make a reservation, for the love of God. And wear your trousers with the expandable waist.",3,0.9983

I was frustrated and disappointed until I went out to Jackson Heights. Tons of great mexican restaurants were the food is authenitc, fresh and delicious. One of my favorites is Taqueria Coatzingo. There tostadas and enchiladas are good, but my favorite is their tacos. I've tried most of them and they all are good, but the chicken and the vegetarian are the best. Also try the al pastor (gyro style) taco. Oh, and you can't beat $2 per taco. And if you love flan, don't miss it. It tastes delicious and they give you a HUGE portion for just $2.50.",8,0.9909

If this Dan is better than the bartenders I did have, this place would need a sixth star: the service was fantastic, their beer descriptions and comparisons extensive, and their recommendations spot on. ""Are your stouts dark?"" a customer asked. The bartender kinda smiled, patiently explained a few things about beer, and helped the customer make a selection. I chatted with the regular sitting to my right for awhile. ""I wasn't a beer drinker until I started coming to this place. It's really opened my eyes to the world of what beer can be."" I told him what I'd tried so far, and my tastes, and he also recommended a couple of great beers. He left with one of the two woman he had been talking to on his other side, so apparently the place is good for that, too. ""Are you here for the poetry open mic?"" another regular asked, observing me writing on my note cards. ""I want to be believed, violently,"" he told everyone later. The jukebox was as eclectic as everything else about the place: They Might Be Giants, lots of Jazz, and The Butthole Surfers are three things I never would have expected to find in the same jukebox. If I lived near this place, I would live at this place.",11,0.9729

Instead of calling ahead of time (they will always be booked), I have been able to get in the same evening just by calling in.  The lobster salad is a must-eat! $32 is worth it. The dressing has a really nice kick to it. The lobster is cooked perfectly. I always have cravings for it, and always order it when I'm there. I ordered the following which have all been superb! Sea bass w/ mushrooms  Squid pasta  Miso black cod. Rock shrimp tempura I also ordered other kinds of fish. You just can't go wrong w/ fish here. They cook it perfectly and have the best sauces to compliment each dish. I don't remember what else I ordered, and tried to look for the menu online to spark my memory.  I don't order sushi here as their entrees and appetizers seem to be there specialty (and you can't get anywhere else. They need to open one in Northern California). Plus I can have amazing sushi back home that is just as fresh. Dessert wise, I ordered the Bento box, chocolate lava cake w/ green tea ice cream. It was pretty good but I've had better. Check out Culinary Insitute of America - Napa for the BEST lava cake. The drinks are really good. I ordered the Mango martini. It was strong on the alcohol but not overpowering. You could taste the fresh mango juice. I loved the extra dried mango they put on the glass. Yummy. Funny thing is, the miso soup sucked! They needed to put more miso in it. Tasted watered down. It's ok, miso soup isn't why I went to Nobu. This place is bank, but what more would you expect out of a restaurant like Nobu.

The wine program truly sets it apart. Large list of full and half bottles that are barely marked up in price and a knowledgeable staff. (So no paying $50 for a bottle you know costs $20.) Have them leave the list with you so you can marvel at the many options and strategize. I always have a steak (either hangar or skirt) with chimichurri sauce and fries. I say I am going to try a new entree each time but the steak always wins. Landmarc serves a variety of cuts and sauces so you can freely mix and match (hangar, strip, skirt, filet mignon, rib eye, or grilled portobello pairs with green peppercorn, shallot bordelaise, dijonnaise, chimichurri, butter maitre d'hotel, bearnaise). It's like Granimals, but with French food. I also love to share the mussels as an appetizer (with similar sauce pairing options). And then share the dessert sampler (with all 6 menu items).  Anyone who knows me knows I hate to share. So not only is Landmarc wonderful, but I grow as a person when I am there.  The decor is cool and modern. Upstairs they have a batcave/ VIP room that I have never sat in --- but I aspire.

The wait staff sliced the steak up to show off the perfect medium-rare color- Pinkish-red on the inside with no blood dripping from it. Splayed on the side of the hot platter to allow the juices to sizzle and then placed on my own plate for me to attack.

There was only one woman who could tame it: Amy at City Salon in San Francisco.  yelp.com/biz/tA6Y1KxwkzE…  I've been going there for the better part of nine years. She has seen everything that the tempest atop my head will throw at her. The seasonally reversing swirl, the inexplicable bald spot on the side, the prominent occipital bun. She has been the most consistent woman in my life for nigh on a decade. Sure, I'll admit that I've strayed once or twice. Out of town on business, too much to drink in a hotel bar, and I've been known to pay a visit to some cheap tramp with a pair of scissors and a come hither smile. With predictable results. Each time, I've returned chagrined, and Amy has had the grace to forgive my weakness and fix whatever damage has been wrought. But through circumstance beyond our control, Amy and I have had to go our separate ways. I moved to New York, and despite my pleadings, she stayed behind. I refrained from getting a haircut for far too long since our parting. Sitting shiva with my head. I decided that it was time to get on with my life. It took me an extra few weeks to drum up the courage. New city, new life, new haircut. I turned to Yelp. Rose suggested Sassy Fashion, and I decided to give it a try. I felt like a widower going out on his first blind date. Paulette was busy, but Louie took me well in hand. He was sensitive to my needs, understanding of my situation. He went to work. A whirl of clippers, the snicker snack of scissors, and I was squirming like a bag full of pythons. Then, with a tenderness known only to hairdressers, battlefield medics, and men of the cloth, he suggested that for the last nine years Amy had been doing everything wrong. I almost stood up and walked out. It's bad enough that I'm cheating on the memory of my dead spouse, but do you have to tell me that she wasn't any good in the sack? Only the scissors in his hand and his cool professional demeanor kept me seated in the chair. I looked him in the eye and said the fateful words: ""Fine. Do it your way."" Half an hour later, as he was putting the finishing touches on my brand new coif, I realized that he was right. For the last nine years, my head looked like the love-child of Elvis, Ted Koppel, and Foghorn Leghorn. Now it looked like a gay investment banker. I'm neither, but I felt as though I could finally throw off the black veil and go about my brand new life. Thank you, Louie.   And he only charged me $21 to boot. Of course, the real verdict will be delivered tonight by my friend Caroline, the judge of all such things. I'll let you know how my hair performs. UPDATE: Caroline has judged the haircut to be ""just fine"" bordering on ""great"".

2394,3,2,5.0,"My first visit was confusing and fun. I was handed this little green ticket at the door by a man who rambled something about giving it back to him when I left. The ticket looked like a bus transfer or carnival ticket that you hole punch. I had no idea what this thing was for but I held onto it figuring that it would explain itself later. The restaurant was expansive! It was one large rectangular room with simple wooden chairs and tables that took up 2/3rds of the dining room and a deli counter that ran along the right side of the dining room. There were all sorts of old framed photographs along the back wall and the menu was on old school plastic boards posted over the counter. What a great old place to take pictures! Each carver had his own line so don't be like me and walk blindly forward following the herd of people. Eventually I figured out that carvers further down the counter had short lines. I ordered the pastrami sandwich which says on the menu ""ask for mayo at your own peril!"" I like mayo on my sandwiches but I opted to skip it since the carvers all seemed pretty busy. The carver cut off a piece of pastrami for me to munch on while he completed my sandwich and it was so delicious! I couldn't wait to get this back to the office and eat it. He packed up some 1/2 sour pickles for me and asked for my green ticket. He wrote on the back what I ordered and how much I owed. I tipped him and then walked back towards the cashier where I turned in my ticket and paid my $14 for the sandwich. Pricy? Yes, but I have no qualms paying this since the sandwich lasted me two meals and I still had some pickles for the next day.",5,0.9815

2398,10,6,5.0,"My fiancee brought me here as a surprise shortly before our trip to San Francisco (and a reservation at the French Laundry). I think the reviews posted thus far speak to the level of service you should expect. The wine sommelier makes you feel like a champ even if you know little-to-nothing about wine and he knows the dishes as if he created them himself. I've read some comments elsewhere how people have left hungry. If you select the nine-course menu you'd have to be Fat Bastard to leave hungry. Just when you think you're done with everything, you get a tiered presentation of petits fours and a little goodie bag of macaroons to go. You may pooh-pooh the idea of going to the mall for a fancy meal but when you're floating (or rolling) down to street level afterward you won't notice the difference. The only reservation left is for 5:30 PM? Not a problem - you'll finish your meal in about four hours and still have time to party, if you can still move after all that food. The problem I have with nine course tasting menus is that it's hard to remember everything I eat. I'm left mostly with the sensation of the overall experience, which is one of wonderment and awe. However, several dishes stand out. The ""cornets"" (salmon tartare with sweet red onion creme fraiche) are wonderful, but what remains engraved in my memory is ""oysters and pearls"" - two pearl-sized oysters floating on a tapioca sabayon and garnished with osetra caviar. Anyone who eats this in two bites should be summarily ejected from the premises. When we were served this dish again at the French Laundry, it was all I could do to keep myself from fist-pumping and yelling. Another dish I remember is a pasta with truffles dish that was served when I requested a substitution. Heavenly. The bowl was angled steeply along the edges sort of like a wine glass, with just enough space for you to just drop your head in and eat sans fork. The Deconstructed Snickers (photo attached) sparked a debate over whether Thomas Keller had to request permission to use the name or if Mars begged him for the publicity. The ""composed"" cheese course is one cheese with several accompaniments so you can explore the various facets of the cheese in detail. If you order coffee, the milk will be warmed. If you're dying to eat here and can't get through the reservations line in the morning rush, call back later in the day and ask to be put on the waiting list. You'll be allowed to pick several days, and if there's a cancellation they'll call you. Just be prepared to move on a moment's notice. Guys - jacket is required, but I've had a curious experience with that policy. The first time we went, I didn't know where we were going so I had a dress shirt but no jacket. They didn't turn us away. In fact, no one said anything. On our second visit, it was June and hot, so I had my jacket on my arm. Before the hostess escorted us into the restaurant, she smiled and discreetly motioned for me to put on my jacket. I took it off again promptly after seating - no injury, no penalty. I haven't been back since the mandatory service charge was added. When you're done with your meal, be sure to ask for a tour of the kitchen. You'll also be taken inside the wine vault. If you want to remember what you ate, you can always ask for a copy of the menu on your way out... but I don't think they deliver.",20,0.9777

I didn't intend to get an electronics junkie's fix from MOMA, so I was surprised to find two exhibits that conjured up images of CES.The first exhibit celebrated Pixar's 20 years as an animation studio. It was admittedly annoying to dodge the gaggles of 9-year olds. Half of the parents in New York City decided the Pixar exhibit was a good excuse to schlep their families to the museum. Fortunately, 9-year olds are too short to block the view, so the exhibit was still excellent. I left with a better appreciation for how critical are the talented human artists behind the animation. Computers make it all possible, but the creativity and vision still come from people, not from machines.Even more impressive than the Pixar stuff was an installation by Janet Cardiff. I wandered into a room devoid of everything but two benches surrounded by 40 speakers configured in a large oval. Cardiff recorded a 40-person chorus and replicated the sound by channeling each voice through one of the 40 speakers. It was among the most interesting aural experiences I've ever had. You could walk through the room, stopping in front of an individual speaker, and it was as if you were standing nose-to-nose with one member of the chorus.

The old man is some kind of genius, with herb garden growing beside the ovens, and his meticulous attention to detail. Some things in life are worth the wait...like the Jay-Z and Nas reunion *tear*...and a slice from Difara's is equally worth the wait.

I think your best bet is to spring for a pie, because if you opt for a single slice, you will be left pining for more. Sitting and waiting has its advantages at Difara, though. When the joint gets really packed, you get to witness this neurotic ballet performed by locals, hipsters (who probably read about Difara's in the Village Voice's Best of NY) and whoever else is waiting for the divine offerings of Difara's.

Great organic produce and natural foods section about two aisles and a freezer aisle yields pretty much everything you need...though I didn't find the vegan cheese....But if you like dairy cheese, this is the place to go - looks like they have tons of cheese - I think the meat section is equally as substantial (I averted my eyes, but I think I saw some bloody stumps hanging somewhere next to the cheese). Huge parking lots, Fairway is located along the Westside Highway at 133rd Street (get off the 125th Street exit). It's easy to access by car and the parking lot has a lovely view of the Hudson River. Always a pleasure to come out of a great food shopping experience and walk out to your car parked along the Hudson River. Worth the trip.

Coincidently, a few other friends were staying in the same hotel. So, needless to say this must be a pretty cheap place to stay. The rooms are ghetto and small...but from other reviewers i guess this is the norm in NYC. I don't know where I'm going with this...Oh yeah, okay so I loved this place because yes, i knew practically everyone staying there (at least by the end of the night) and more importantly at 5 in the morning the lobby was basically the place to be. All tourists partying, drinking and eating pizza and conglomerating without any busybody security guards breaking up the fun. That is why I gave it five stars.

I was skimming at other things in the person set up area, and she just sized me up and pulled out a coat that makes me not fear the winter!

Also, he has strange bicycle chain permanently attached around wrist. I wanted to cut it off with big steak knife. Food far surpassed conversation, and bathroom was a welcome refuge, with very zen-like sink faucets and little river stones for meditation.

On a Sunday night when the usuals are headed back from the Hamptons, it's UNusually empty (meaning you can actually get a seat). No reservations. No credit cards.

So I tell him, ""I want the best espresso in town, I'll pay for the cab, let's go."" So he tells me we can walk to this joint about 10 blocks away, and on the way he tells me about acidity and foam and temperature and on and on. After sitting down in the charming cafe/restaurant I was thoroughly impressed because the place smelled Italian. It's tough to explain but old places in Europe have this funky smell that you remember forever and this joint must have imported some Euro stank for authenticity. It worked, I was charmed out of my pants and the espresso was the best I've ever had and I've drank my share. It was not too acidic and lingered all over my mouth with a deep richness. After getting home, I had forgotten the name of this amazing cafe and so, knowing how much of a critic Josh is, I Googled ""Best espresso NYC"" and low and behold, the first result was Via Quadronno.
