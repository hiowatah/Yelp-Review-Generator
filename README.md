# Yelp-Review-Generator
Using NLP and Deep Learning, I have created a text generator that types out your review for you which saves you time and let's you get to the 'Elite' status more easily!


## Initial EDA

I wanted to see what types of reviews users found to be funny, cool, and useful. Please see below for the top reviews from my initial scrape.

<p align="center">
  <u><b> Funniest and Cool Review </b></u>
</p> 
<p align="center">
  <img src="./Images/Funny and Cool.png" title="Funny & Cool">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <u><b> Most Useful Review </b></u>
</p> 
<p align="center">
  <img src="./Images/Useful.png" title="Funny & Cool">
</p>

Because I want to run a model for each star rating, based on my rating distribution below, I will need additional datapoints for 1, 2, and 3 star ratings. As such, in addition to the scraped reviews, I will be using the Yelp Dataset they make available every year.

  <u><b> Distribution of Ratings </b></u>

While I wanted to initially include the most funny, cool, and useful reviews from the Yelp Dataset as well, these reviews were all about Amy's Baking Company which was features on Gordon Ramsey's show "Kitchen Nightmares". As such, I am excluding them but including the distribution of the ratings from this dataset.
